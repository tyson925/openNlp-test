<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>
Background
The Need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multi-pollutant Legislation</ENAMEX>
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, power generation is responsible for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SO2</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37%</NUMEX> of
man-made mercury released to the environment. Once released, these
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> together with their atmospheric transformation products
(<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g. ozone</ENAMEX> and fine particles) can travel long distances before
being deposited. Environmental and public health problems resulting
from power generation emissions include:


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiovascular</ENAMEX> and respiratory conditions associated with
exposure to fine particles (PM) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>;


•
Visibility impairment associated with regional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haze</ENAMEX>;


•
Acidification of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> and forest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecosystems</ENAMEX>;


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecosystem</ENAMEX> and public health effects associated with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>;


•
Acidic damage to cultural monuments and other
materials;


•
Ozone damage to forested ecosystems; and


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eutrophication</ENAMEX> in coastal areas.


While the current <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> has played a role in
significantly improving some of these issues, additional reductions
in the emissions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> are necessary to address
persistent public health and environmental problems. Because of the
regional and global scale of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or
localities experiencing the environmental effects cannot always
control them. In addition, current law tends to address each
environmental problem independently, even if one pollutant
contributes to several problems. To more effectively address the
environmental problems caused by power generation, there is a need
for a national program that would take advantage of synergies of
controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> at once.
The Clear Skies Act
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 14, 2002</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> announced the Clear Skies
Initiative, a proposal to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> from electric power
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The proposal was embodied in legislative form
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, which was introduced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> as H.R.5266 and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> as S.2815 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>. For the purpose of the analyses presented here, the central
features examined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Initiative</ENAMEX> are identical to those
contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> would reduce emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SO2</NUMEX>), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> from fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>-fired
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combustion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 70%</NUMEX> from current levels<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> These
mandatory emission reductions would be achieved through a cap and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 The Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> would cut <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SO2</NUMEX>) emissions
by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 percent</NUMEX>, from current emissions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 million tons</NUMEX> to caps of
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.5 million tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 million tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>. It would cut
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67 percent</NUMEX>, from current
emissions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 million tons</NUMEX>
program, modeled on the current <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX>.
Federally <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enforceable</ENAMEX> emissions limits, or national caps, for each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pollutant</ENAMEX> would be established. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> would be allowed to
transfer these authorized emission limits among themselves to
achieve the required reductions for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> at the
lowest overall cost. This proposal would alleviate many of the
remaining environmental and health problems associated with power
generation.
This document reports the methods and results of an analysis of
the environmental and health benefits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. It
presents quantitative estimates of the health improvements and
monetary benefits that would be achieved by this proposal.


Summary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benefits Analysis Methods</ENAMEX> and Results
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> would provide significant benefits to public
health and the environment, whether expressed as health and
environmental improvements or as monetized benefits. These include
prolonging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of lives and reducing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of cases in other indicators of adverse health effects,
such as work loss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, restricted activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma attacks</ENAMEX>. Environmental benefits include significant
increases in visibility and substantial improvements in chronically
acidic conditions in lakes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northeastern US</ENAMEX>. Based on
emissions reductions that would start well before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and the
expected increase in benefits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2010 and 2020</TIMEX>, the cumulative
health benefits of the program across the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next two decades</TIMEX> would be
significant. The key results of this analysis of the Clear Skies
Act are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Exhibit</ENAMEX> 1.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical Approach</ENAMEX>) discusses the analytic
framework used in conducting this assessment, which includes
scenario development, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> modeling, air quality modeling,
human health and visibility effects estimation, economic valuation,
and adjustments for income growth and benefits aggregation.
As depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exhibit 1</ENAMEX>, we have used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches to provide
benefits in health and environmental effects and in monetary terms.
While there is a substantial difference in the specific estimates,
both approaches show that the monetary benefits of the Clear Skies
Act are well in excess of the estimated costs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.7 billion</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.5 billion</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2020.2</NUMEX>
The first approach presented, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>, is a
peer-reviewed method developed for previous risk and benefit-cost
assessments carried out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>. It
is the method used in the regulatory assessments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy Duty</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diesel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tier II Rules</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 812</ENAMEX> Report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
Following the approach of these earlier assessments, along with the
results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>, we present various sensitivity
analyses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> that alter select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subsets</ENAMEX> of
variables; these sensitivity analyses yield results <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 42</NUMEX>
percent lower to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 180 percent</NUMEX> higher. By far, the largest
component of these monetized benefits is related to premature
mortality from long-term exposure to particulate matter (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$41</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion and $89 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX>, respectively), followed
by chronic bronchitis (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.5 billion and $3.2 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>, respectively).
to caps of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.1 million tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.7 million tons</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> emissions would be reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 percent</NUMEX>, from
current emissions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 tons</NUMEX> to caps of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 tons</NUMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>.
Detailed information on the costs of Clear Skies can be found in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act Analytical Support Package</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).
In order to provide some insight into the potential importance
of the key elements underlying estimates of the benefits of
reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOx</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOx</ENAMEX> emissions, we developed an Alternative
Estimate using different choices of data, methods, and assumptions
that are detailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical Approach</ENAMEX>). As indicated
in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exhibit 1</ENAMEX>, the differences between the Alternative and Base
Estimates are found in the estimation of the impact of fine
particle reductions on premature mortality and the valuation of
reducing the risk of premature mortality and the risk of chronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchitis</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> of the impact of fine particle
reductions on premature mortality relies on recent scientific
studies finding an association between increased mortality and
short-term (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>) exposure to particulate matter, while
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> relies on a recent reanalysis of earlier studies
that found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between long-term exposure to fine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> and increased mortality. The Alternative approach also
uses different data to value reductions in the risk of premature
mortality and chronic bronchitis and makes adjustments relating to
the health status and potential longevity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> most
likely affected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>. Even using the more conservative assumptions
of this Alternative, the benefits of Clear Skies still outweigh the
projected costs of the proposal.
All such benefit estimates are subject to a number of
assumptions and uncertainties, which are discussed in Section III
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Major Uncertainties</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benefits Analysis</ENAMEX>) of this report. For
example key assumptions underlying the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> and Alternative
Estimates for the mortality category include the following: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
Inhalation of fine particles is causally associated with premature
death at concentrations near those experienced by most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> on
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis. While biological mechanisms for this effect have not
yet been definitively established, the weight of the available
epidemiological evidence supports an assumption of causality. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
All fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are
equally potent in causing premature mortality. This is an important
assumption, because fine particles from power plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> are
chemically different from directly emitted fine particles from both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and other industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, but no clear
scientific grounds exist for supporting differential effects
estimates by particle type. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) The concentration-response function
for fine particles is approximately linear within the range of
ambient concentrations under consideration. Thus, the estimates
include health benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with
varied concentrations of particulate matter, including both regions
that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that
do not meet the standard. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) The forecasts for future emissions
and associated air quality modeling are valid. Although recognizing
the difficulties, assumptions and inherent uncertainties in the
overall enterprise, these analyses are based on peer-reviewed
scientific literature and up-to-date assessment tools, and we
believe the results are highly useful in assessing this
proposal.
In addition to the quantified and monetized benefits summarized
above, there are a number of additional categories are not
currently amenable to quantification or valuation. These include:
the health and environmental benefits of reducing mercury
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>; reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and
particulate deposition damage to cultural monuments and other
materials; reduced ozone effects on forested ecosystems; and
environmental benefits due to reductions of impacts of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acidification</ENAMEX> in lakes and streams and eutrophication in coastal
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. Additionally, we have not quantified a number of known or
suspected health effects linked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> for which
appropriate concentration-response functions are not available or
which do not provide easily interpretable outcomes (i.e. changes in
forced expiratory volume (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FEV1</NUMEX>)).
As a result, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> and Alternative monetized benefits
estimates underestimate the total benefits attributable to the
Clear Skies Act.

Benefits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 20203</TIMEX>


* Results calculated using <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">three percent</NUMEX> discount rate as
recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guidelines for Economic Analysis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX>,
2000a).
** Results calculated using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> percent discount rate as
recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-94</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>).
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of estimates depicted in this table reflect
alternative assumptions and analytical approaches regarding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantifying</ENAMEX> and evaluating the effects of airborne particles on
public health. All estimates assume that particles are causally
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with health effects, and that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> have the
same toxicity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> concentration-response relationships between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and all health effects are assumed, indicating that reductions
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> have the same impact on health outcomes regardless of the
absolute level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> in a given location. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> relies
on estimates of the potential cumulative effect of long-term
exposure to particles, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> presumes that
PM effects are limited to those that accumulate over much shorter
time periods. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> also uses different
approaches to value health effects damages. All such estimates are
subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties. It is of note
that, based on recent preliminary findings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Effects</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>, the magnitude of mortality from short-tern exposure
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>) and hospital/<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> admissions estimates (both
estimates) may be under or overestimated.


II. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYTICAL APPROACH</ENAMEX>
The framework for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> benefits analysis is the
same as that used in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> recent state-of-the-art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> regulatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 812 Prospective Analysis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999a</TIMEX>);
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tier II</ENAMEX> motor vehicle/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline sulfur</ENAMEX> rules <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Impact</ENAMEX>
Analysis (RIA) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999b</TIMEX>); and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel</ENAMEX>
Fuel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RIA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). The analysis uses the same health
effect and valuation functions employed in the most recent of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel RIA</ENAMEX>. The analytical
approach can be described as a sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> steps, summarized
below and described in detail later in this report. These steps,
listed in order of completion, are:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Scenario development


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Emissions modeling


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Air qua <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lity</ENAMEX> modeling


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Human health and visibility effects estimation


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
Economic valuation


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
Adjustments for income growth and benefits
aggregation


Exhibit 2 outlines the analytical framework used to study the
benefits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the benefits
analysis is the specification of the regulatory scenarios that will
be evaluated. Typically, an analysis will include a baseline
scenario that simulates future conditions in the absence of the
proposed regulation and one or more control scenarios that simulate
conditions under the regulations being evaluated. The benefits of a
proposed regulation are then estimated as the difference in benefit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX> (e.g., adverse health effects) between the control and
baseline scenarios. For this analysis, the baseline scenarios for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX> assume no additional emissions control regulation
beyond the continuing effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title IV of the Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>
Amendments, the NOx SIP Call, and other promulgated federal rules
issued under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX>), our
analysis evaluates a single control scenario, as described
below.
After scenario development, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step of the benefits
analysis is the estimation of the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> on
emissions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. We generated emissions estimates for the
baseline by projecting changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> under the baseline case
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX>. We generated emissions estimates for the Clear
Skies Act control scenario using the same set of economic activity
projections as the baseline but with additional emissions controls
consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> caps. Emissions inputs were
derived from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> NTI and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> NEI. In addition, emissions
inventories prepared for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine</ENAMEX> rulemaking
were the basis for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">future year</TIMEX> emissions projections. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Planning</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX> (IPM) was used to derive all future
projections of electricity generation source emissions.
After the emissions inventories are developed, they are
translated into estimates of futureyear air quality conditions
under each scenario. We employed two sophisticated computer models,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Modeling System</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerosols</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deposition</ENAMEX> (REMSAD)
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Air Quality</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model with Extensions</ENAMEX> (CAMx) to
estimate changes to the concentration of particulate matter and
ozone, respectively, resulting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. The REMSAD
model was also used to estimate changes in visibility associated
with those changes in particulate matter concentrations and to
estimate changes in deposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX>, nitrogen, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX>.
The air quality modeling results serve as inputs to a modeling
system that translates air quality changes to changes in health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX> (e.g., premature mortality, emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> visits) through
the use of concentration-response functions. Scientific literature
on the health effects of air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> provides the source of
these concentration-response functions. At this point, we derive
estimates of the differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenarios in terms of
incidences of a range of human health effects that are associated
with exposure to ambient particulate matter and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>.
In the next step, we use economic valuation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX> to estimate a dollar value for the reduced incidence
of those adverse effects amenable to monetization. For example,
analysis of estimates derived from the economic literature provides
an estimate of the value of reductions in mortality risk. Finally,
we adjust the benefit values for expected income growth through
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX> and aggregate the benefits to the appropriate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> level.
As noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section I</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>), we present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Base</ENAMEX> and
Alternative estimates for mortality and chronic bronchitis
benefits. The different methodologies and assumptions for these
approaches are discussed in separate subsections in the effects
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX> and valuation sections below.

Baseline and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Scenario Development</ENAMEX>
This analysis looks at the impacts of the multi-pollutant
reductions that are part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> future
target <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX>. Avoided health effects and visibility
improvements are quantified by comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> scenarios:


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
A baseline scenario (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Case</ENAMEX>) that reflects the
continuing effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments</ENAMEX> (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program) as well as other promulgated federal rules
issued under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> authority that are expected to affect
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electric Generating Units</ENAMEX> (EGUs) and other sources of emissions
(e.g. the NOx SIP call and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tier II and Heavy Duty Diesel Rules</ENAMEX>
for mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>).

A scenario that reflects full implementation of the Clear

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emissions Profile Development</ENAMEX>
Emissions Inventories
Emission inventories were developed to support the benefits
analysis fo r the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. Emissions profiles were
generated for the following cases: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> Base <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year, 2010</TIMEX> Base Case,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">2010 Clear Skies, 2020 Base Case, and 2020 Clear Skies</ENAMEX>.
These national inventories were prepared for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> level for mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> and non-road <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. They were
prepared for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> at the countylevel for
electric generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (EGU), non-EGU point, and stationary area
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The approach used to create inventories was the same as
that used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine</ENAMEX> (HDE) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rulemaking</ENAMEX> analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000d</TIMEX>) with modifications to reflect emission and modeling
advances since that analysis<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>

emissions under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Case</ENAMEX> and differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> Case
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. It was constructed using existing
emissions inventories created for various recent rulemaking
activities. For criteria <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">National Emissions</ENAMEX>
Inventory (NEI) used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy Duty Diesel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> rulemaking
was used. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Toxics Inventory</ENAMEX> was
modified based on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> information collection effort for coal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utilities</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> MACT implementation for medical waste
incinerators, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> MACT implementation for municipal waste
combustors was used.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2010 and 2020</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Cases</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> under current
regulations with economic and population growth were projected. The
electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> portion was developed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Planning Model</ENAMEX> (IPM). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX> projects power sector emissions under
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Acid Rain</ENAMEX>
Program), which caps SO2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.95 million tons</NUMEX>/year
beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX>'s projections for electric
utilities under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> Case include the NOX SIP Call with a cap
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">summertime NOX</ENAMEX> emissions in SIP Call <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> (based on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/mmBtu from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) and state-imposed NOX caps in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>. This case also includes no controls on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> emissions from power generation. The emissions inventory
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Case</ENAMEX> also includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tier II and Heavy Duty Diesel Rules</ENAMEX>
for mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The uncertainty about how these mobile source
rules will be implemented in the future contributes to uncertainty
in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Case</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> profile.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> profile includes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5 million</NUMEX>
ton<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/year</TIMEX> cap on EGUs beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SO2</ENAMEX> emissions, which
will be lowered to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 million ton</NUMEX> cap in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>; a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1 million</NUMEX>
ton/yr cap beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOX</ENAMEX> emissions, which will be
lowered to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.7 million ton</NUMEX> cap in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>; and a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 ton</NUMEX>/yr cap
beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury emissions</ENAMEX>, which will be lowered to a
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 ton</NUMEX> cap in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> can reduce emissions early,
earn allowances for these actions, and use the allowances later,
actual emissions are projected to be higher than the cap in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of each cap.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Planning</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX> (IPM)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Planning</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX> (IPM) predicts future emissions
outputs from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. These outputs
are used to develop the emissions inventories.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX> is a linear programming model of the electricity sector that
finds the most efficient
(i.e. least cost) approach to operating the electric power
system over a given time period subjectto specific constraints
(e.g. pollution caps or transmission limitations). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, which
was developed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICF Resources, Inc.</ENAMEX>, selects investment
strategies given the cost and performance characteristics of
available options, forecasts of customer demand for electricity,
and reliability criteria. System dispatch, which determines the
proper and most efficient use of the existing and new resources
available to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, is optimized given the
resource <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> operating characteristics, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> and other
costs. Unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> operating constraints provide
system-specific realism to the outputs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX> is dynamic; it has the capability to use forecasts of
future conditions, requirements, and option characteristics to make
decisions for the present. This ability replicates, to the extent
possible, the perspective of utility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, regulatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and the public in reviewing important investment options
for the utility industry and electricity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. Decisions are
made based on minimizing the net present value of capital and
operating costs over the full planning horizon. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX> also models a
variety of environmental market mechanisms, such as emissions caps,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allowances</ENAMEX>, trading, and banking. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Quality and Deposition Modeling</ENAMEX>
Air quality modeling is a critical analytical step that provides
the link between emissions changes and the physical effects that
affect human health and the environment. This step of the analysis
employs complex computer models that simulate the transport and
transformation of emitted pollutants in the atmosphere. The results
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> runs are predictions of pollutant concentrations
under each of the emission control scenarios specified above. These
predicted concentrations are then used as inputs to the human
health effect estimation model discussed in the next section.
Air quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modelers</ENAMEX> face <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key challenges in attempting to
translate emission inventories into pollutant concentrations.
First, they must model the dispersion and transport of pollutants
through the atmosphere. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, they must model pertinent
atmospheric chemistry and other pollutant transformation and
removal processes. These challenges are particularly difficult for
those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> that are not emitted directly but instead form
through secondary processes. Ozone is the best example; it forms in
the atmosphere through a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, non-linear chemical
interactions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precursor pollutants</ENAMEX>, particularly certain classes
of volatile organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modelers</ENAMEX> face similar challenges when

estimating PM concentrations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atmospheric</ENAMEX> transformation of
gaseous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> and nitrogen oxides to particulate sulfates
and nitrates, respectively, contributes significantly to ambient
concentrations of fine particulate matter. In addition to
recognizing the complex atmospheric chemistry relevant for some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pollutants</ENAMEX>, air quality modelers also must deal with uncertainties
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with variable meteorology and the spatial and temporal
distribution of emissions.
Air quality modelers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have responded to the need
for scientifically valid and reliable estimates of air quality
changes by developing a number of sophisticated atmospheric
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dispersion</ENAMEX> and transformation models. Some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> have
been employed in support of the development of federal clean air
programs, national assessment studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Implementation</ENAMEX> Plans
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIPs</ENAMEX>), and individual air toxic source risk assessments. In this
analysis, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of these well-established <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, the
Regional <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Modeling System for Aerosols and Deposition</ENAMEX> (REMSAD) and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Air Quality</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model with Extensions</ENAMEX> (CAMx), to
develop a picture of future changes in air quality resulting from
the implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>.
Regional <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Modeling System for Aerosols and Deposition</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX>)
The change in PM concentrations due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> was
modeled using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Modeling System</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerosols</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deposition</ENAMEX> (REMSAD). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> was also used to estimate the changes
in visibility and deposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>, nitrogen, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> is a three-dimensional, grid-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eulerian</ENAMEX> air quality
model designed to simulate long-term (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX>) concentrations
and deposition fluxes of atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> over large spatial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scales</ENAMEX> (e.g., over the contiguous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>). Air pollution issues meant
to be addressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> include long-term PM2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> ambient
concentrations; visibility; ambient concentrations and deposition
fluxes of several hazardous air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>;
deposition fluxes of nutrient nitrogen; and deposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfuric acid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric acid</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> has been developed under funding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protection Agency</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX>. REMSAD
consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> components: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a meteorological data
pre-processor; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the core aerosol and toxic deposition model
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATDM</ENAMEX>); and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) postprocessing programs. The horizontal grid size
can be on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km</NUMEX>) for an urban-scale
simulation up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 100 km</NUMEX> for a continental-scale simulation.
For large-scale simulations, one-way nesting of fine and coarse
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grids</ENAMEX> can be performed to allow simulation of sensitive areas with
strong pollution spatial gradients using a fine grid resolution.
The vertical structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">REMSAD</ENAMEX> covers the whole troposphere from
the surface up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 15 km.</NUMEX> The physical and chemical processes
simulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> include emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> from surface
and elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, advective transport, horizontal turbulent
diffusion, vertical mixing via turbulent diffusion and convective
transport, cloud processes, gas-phase and aqueous-phase chemistry,
PM2.5 formation, dry deposition and wet deposition.
Version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.40</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> was employed for this analysis. Previous
versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> have been used to estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy</ENAMEX>

Prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">REMSAD Version 6.40</ENAMEX> includes improvements
that address comments <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> obtained during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1999</TIMEX> peer review of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">REMSAD Version 4.1</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seigneur et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), including improved treatment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nitrate</ENAMEX>/sulfate equilibrium, inclusion of additional
aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfate</ENAMEX> formation pathways, and expanded treatment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> chemistry (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICF Consulting</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> modeling domain selected for the Clear Skies Act
consists of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 km x 36 km</NUMEX> grid cells covering the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-contiguous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> can perform a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full-year</TIMEX> simulation,
generating predictions of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly PM</TIMEX> concentrations (including both
PM2.5 component <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM10</ENAMEX>) at each grid cell. These <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX>
predictions form the basis for direct calculation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> PM air quality metrics (e.g., annual mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> concentration)
as inputs to the health and welfare C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions of the benefits
analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> also gives visibility, which is used as an input
into the visibility damage function.
For this benefits analysis, we applied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> to the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four future-year</TIMEX> scenarios: a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> Base Case, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> Base Case,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">2010 Clear Skies Act Case, and a 2020 Clear Skies Act Case</ENAMEX>. The
difference in REMSAD-modeled PM concentrations for these scenarios
represents the expected change in PM due to the emission controls
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Air Quality</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model with Extensions</ENAMEX> (CAMx)
We modeled changes in ozone in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> using the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Air Quality</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model with Extensions</ENAMEX> (CAMx). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMx</ENAMEX> is an
Eulerian photochemical dispersion model designed to assess both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gaseous</ENAMEX> and particulate air pollution over many scales, from urban
to super-regional. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> estimates concentrations of both inert
and chemically reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> by simulating the physical and
chemical processes in the atmosphere that affect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> formation.
The latest version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CAMx 3.10</NUMEX>, provides full support
for parallel processing for increased computational performance, as
well as new algorithms for gas phase chemistry (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v3.10 User</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2002</TIMEX>).
The modeling domain for this analysis encompasses most of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eastern U.S.</ENAMEX>, bounded on the east by the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">67 degrees</NUMEX> west longitude
and on the west by the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">99 degrees</NUMEX> west longitude. Ozone modeling is
only done for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> because there is very little confidence in
the application of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to the West. The horizontal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> for the outer grid is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 36 km.</NUMEX> The
horizontal resolution for the inner grid is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 12 km.</NUMEX>
The vertical resolution for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grids</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> layers. The
top of the modeling domain is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4000 meters</NUMEX> above ground level.
Recognizing the relationship between grid cell resolution and the
certainty of results, we sought to estimate pollutant
concentrations in more populated areas using higher resolution
models. Similarly, we used an intermediate resolution grid (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX> x
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX>) to model <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">inner OTAG</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> where population
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX> is high and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> transport is a major problem<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> This
approach makes CAMx well suited to estimate effects based on a
range of ozone averaging times, an important capability for
benefits assessment applications.
This study extracted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX>, surface-layer ozone concentrations
for each grid-cell from the standard CAMx output file containing
hourly average ozone values. These model predictions are used in
conjunction with the observed concentrations obtained from the

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ozone Transport Assessment Group</ENAMEX> (OTAG) consists of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>

region is comprised of the more eastern (and more populated) states
within the OTAG domain.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Retrieval System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIRS</ENAMEX>) to generate ozone
concentrations for the entire ozone season. 7,8 The predicted
changes in ozone concentrations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Case</ENAMEX> to the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX> serve as inputs to the health and welfare C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions
of the benefits analysis, i.e., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criteria Air Pollutant Modeling</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System</ENAMEX> (CAPMS).
In order to estimate ozone-related health and welfare effects
for the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, fullseason ozone data are required for every
CAPMS grid-cell. Given available ozone monitoring data, we
generated full-season ozone profiles for each location in the
modeling domain in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) we combine monitored observations
and modeled ozone predictions to interpolate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> ozone
concentrations to a grid of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km by 8 km</NUMEX> population grid-cells, as
will be described in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Health and Environmental Effects</ENAMEX>
Modeling section, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) we converted these full-season <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX>
ozone profiles to an ozone measure of interest, such as the daily
average. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> For the analysis of ozone impacts on agriculture, we
use a similar approach except air quality is interpolated to county
centroids as opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> grid-cells. We report ozone
concentrations as a cumulative index called <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SUM06</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SUM06</ENAMEX> is
the sum of the ozone concentrations for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour</TIMEX> that exceeds
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX> parts per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">million</NUMEX> (ppm) within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a 12-hour</TIMEX> period from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 am</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pm</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months of May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. These methods are described
in detail in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel RIA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Health and Environmental Effects Modeling</ENAMEX>
As part of the evaluation of the effects of various scenarios
concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SO2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOx</ENAMEX> emissions, we have identified and, where
possible, developed quantitative, monetized estimates of these
health benefits. This <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> describes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in this
process, the estimation of changes in the incidence of adverse
health effects. Our analysis also looked at several environmental
endpoints, including the benefits associated with visibility
improvements, ozone damage to agriculture, and changes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acidification</ENAMEX> in lakes and streams in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>.
Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> provides a list of the health effects for which we
estimate quantified benefits as part of our analysis plus a list of
the health effects for which we are unable to quantify benefits at
this time. The unquantified benefits for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
categories: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) those for which the scientific literature does not
provide an established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concentration-Response</ENAMEX> (C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) function
capable of estimating health effects with reasonable certainty and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) those effects that may double-count benefits (e.g., hospital
admissions for specific cardiovascular illnesses). The direct
health effects of nitrogen oxide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide gases</ENAMEX> are
also unquantified. Although C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions are available to estimate

The ozone season for this analysis is defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-month</ENAMEX>
period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>; however, to estimate certain crop
yield benefits, the modeling results were extended to include
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> outside the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-month</TIMEX> ozone season.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIRS</ENAMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">949</NUMEX> ozone monitors with sufficient

of these effects have not been quantified as part of our analysis,
due to data or modeling limitations. We have, however, monetized
effects of changes in ambient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> on some agricultural production
and changes in particulate matter on visibility.

To estimate health benefits from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, we used
the same general approach used in recent major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">OAR</ENAMEX> regulatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999b and 2000b</TIMEX>). This approach takes
the estimates of changes in ambient pollutant concentrations
predicted by air quality modeling for each scenario (relative to
the baseline scenario) and converts them into estimates of changes
in the incidence of adverse health effects using
concentration-response (C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) functions. The model we use to
generate these estimates is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criteria Air Pollutant Modeling</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System</ENAMEX> (CAPMS).
We calculated the benefits attributable to the Clear Skies Act
as the change in incidence of adverse health effects between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and baseline scenarios. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPMS</ENAMEX> estimates incidence changes
for each health effect within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km x 8 km</NUMEX> grid cells covering the
contiguous
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and generates national health benefits estimates by summing
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> incidence changefor each effect across all grid cells.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPMS</ENAMEX> uses C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions specific to each health effect to
calculate incidences in each grid cell. C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions are equations
that relate the change in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in a population
exhibiting a "response" (in this case an adverse health effect such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">respiratory disease</ENAMEX>) to a change in pollutant concentration
experienced by that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In general, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R functions used
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPMS</ENAMEX> require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> input values: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the grid-cell-specific
change in pollutant concentration; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the grid-cell affected
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> (i.e. asthmatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the baseline incidence
rate of the health effects; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) an estimate of the change in
the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that suffer an adverse health effect per
unit change in air quality. Both the form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R function and
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> input value are derived from epidemiological studies in
the scientific literature that link pollutant exposures with
adverse health effects.
In addition to our national benefits results, we generated
regional estimates of the benefits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> using the
same benefits estimation procedure used to generate the national
estimates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMx</ENAMEX> air quality models provide
information on the improvements in ambient air concentrations
throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 km by 36 km</NUMEX> gridboxes. This
information is used in subsequent exposure, dose-response, and
valuation steps, including location-specific baseline mortality and
morbidity risk data to generate locationspecific estimates of
health benefits. This "bottom-up" approach provides a more accurate
representation of regional benefits estimates than a comparable
"top-down", <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX>-weighted approach might, particularly given
the importance of long-range transport for the major pollutants
controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SO2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX>, as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX>).
Recreational visibility benefits can also be geographically
disaggregated, based on either the location of the recreational
Class I area where visibility is improved, or on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of
origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. For this analysis, we
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disaggregated</ENAMEX> benefits based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>,
reflecting the notion that many of the recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with the
highest visitation rates are valued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> throughout the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, not only by those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who live closest to the
site. The results of the regional analysis of visibility benefits
indicate that benefits are realized throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with a
higher concentration of benefits in those areas of higher
population density.
Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> provides a list of the health effect endpoints we
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quantified</ENAMEX> as part of our analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, as well
as references to the studies that serve as the basis for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
functions. As with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> and air quality estimates, our
estimates of the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ambient pollution</ENAMEX> levels on all of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX> represent the best science and analytical tools
available. With the exception of the short-term mortality endpoint,
the choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R functions and the majority of the analytical
assumptions used to develop our estimates have been reviewed and
approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Advisory Board</ENAMEX> (SAB). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R functions
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Exhibit</ENAMEX> 6 only capture effects related to exposures to
particulate matter and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>; they do not include human health
effects related to exposures to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">NO2</TIMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>. As a result,
for these exposures, we have underestimated the total health
benefits attributable to Clear Skies emissions reductions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Quality Changes</ENAMEX>
As in the analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel Rule</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD PM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAMx ozone</ENAMEX> results discussed
above served as direct inputs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. To calculate
population exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km by 8 km</NUMEX> CAPMS grid cell was
assigned to the nearest REMSAD grid cell by calculating the
shortest distance between the center of the CAPMS grid cell to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of a REMSAD grid cell.
To develop baseline and control exposure predictions for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>,
we used the results of the variable-grid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Air Quality</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model with Extensions</ENAMEX> (CAMx) for each scenario and observed ozone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> for the baseline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>). At each ozone monitor, we
quantified the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMx</ENAMEX> modeled levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> at
the monitor for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">future year</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 or 2020</TIMEX>). These
adjustment ratios are applied to the actual monitoring data to
generate estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> levels at the monitor for the future
scenarios. Note that we do not use the modeling data directly to
estimate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">future-year</TIMEX> ozone levels. Instead, we use them in a
relative sense to simply adjust actual, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> ozone monitor levels
to future Base Case or Clear Skies levels. This provides a better
estimate than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAMx</ENAMEX> modeling data itself. To calculate
population exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPMS</ENAMEX> grid cell was assigned a
distance-weighted average of adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> levels from nearby
ozone monitors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Population</ENAMEX>
Health benefits are related to the change in air pollutant
exposure experienced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>; because the expected changes
in pollutant concentrations vary from location to location,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in different parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> may not experience
the same level of health benefits. We apportioned benefits among
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> by matching the change in air pollutant concentration
in each grid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> with the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that experiences
that change. We extrapolated grid cell population estimates for
future <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years from 1990</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Census Bureau</ENAMEX> data according to the
method described in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000b</NUMEX>).

An epidemiological study typically focuses on a particular age
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 30 and older</TIMEX>), and the C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> relationship
found in a particular study can not necessarily be generalized
across broader age categories. Therefore, to avoid overestimating
the benefits of reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> levels, we applied <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
relationships only to those age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX>
studied. For outcomes where the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> reflects data
limitations and not the age-specificity of a health effect, this
assumption may lead us to underestimate the benefits of reductions
in pollutant exposures to the entire, exposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baseline Incidence Rate</ENAMEX>
Some C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions (those expressed as a change relative to
baseline conditions) require baseline incidence data associated
with ambient levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">County</ENAMEX> mortality rates were used
in the estimation of PM-related mortality. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> admissions,
national level incidence rates were used. In cases where neither
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX> nor national-level incidence rates were available, the
baseline incidence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R reference study was applied.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> for incidence rates are given in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000b</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concentration-Response Functions</ENAMEX>
We relied on the most recently available, published scientific
literature to ascertain the relationship between particulate matter
exposure and adverse human health effects. We evaluated studies
using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> selection criteria summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exhibit 7</ENAMEX>. These
criteria include consideration of whether the study was
peer-reviewed, the study design and location, and characteristics
of the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, among other considerations. The selection
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R functions for the benefits analysis is guided by the goal of
achieving a balance between comprehensiveness and scientific
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defensibility</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R functions for PM exposure selected for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> are the same as those the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel RIA</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> uses alternative C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions to evaluate the
effect of short-term exposure to particulate matter on premature
mortality. We present information below on the selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
functions for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most significant health effects evaluated (in
terms of monetized benefits), premature mortality and chronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchitis</ENAMEX>. Detailed information on the selection and application
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R functions for other endpoints in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exhibit 4</ENAMEX> is available in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel RIA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>).


Exhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">7 Summary of Considerations Used</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Selecting C-</ENAMEX>R
Functions
Consideration Comments
Peer reviewed research Peer reviewed research is preferred to
research that has not undergone the peer review process.
Study type Among studies that consider chronic exposure (e.g.,
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or longer) prospective cohort studies are preferred
over <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cross-sectional</ENAMEX> studies (a.k.a. "ecological studies") because
they control for important confounding variables that cannot be
controlled for in cross-sectional studies. If the chronic effects
of a pollutant are considered more important than its acute
effects, prospective cohort studies may also be preferable to
longitudinal time series studies because the latter type of study
is typically designed to detect the effects of short-term (e.g.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>) exposures, rather than chronic exposures. If short-term
effects are considered more important, distributed lag approaches,
which assume that mortality following a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> event will be
distributed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a number of days</TIMEX> following the event, are
preferred over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> mortality studies. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily</ENAMEX> mortality studies
examine the impact of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PM2.5</NUMEX> on mortality on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single day</TIMEX> or over
the average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX>).
Study period Studies examining a relatively longer period of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> (and therefore having more data) are preferred, because they
have greater statistical power to detect effects. More recent
studies are also preferred because of possible changes in pollution
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixes</ENAMEX>, medical care, and life style over time.
Study population
Studies examining a relatively large sample are preferred.
Studies of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population groups</ENAMEX> are generally disfavored,
although this does not exclude the possibility of studying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that are potentially more sensitive to pollutants
(e.g., asthmatics, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>). However, there are tradeoffs
to comprehensiveness of study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Selecting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R function
from a study that considered all ages will avoid omitting the
benefits associated with any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> category. However, if
the age distribution of a study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from an "all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>"
study is different from the age distribution in the assessment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and if pollutant effects vary by age, then bias can be
introduced into the benefits analysis.
Study location <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> studies are more desirable than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-U.S.</ENAMEX>
studies because of potential differences in pollution
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, exposure patterns, medical care system, and life
style.
Pollutants included in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model Models</ENAMEX> with more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> are
generally preferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> with fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>, though careful
attention must be paid to potential colinearity between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>.
Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> has been acknowledged to be an important and pervasive
pollutant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that include some measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> are highly
preferred to those that do not.
Measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM2.5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM10</ENAMEX> are preferred to other measures of
particulate matter, such as total suspended particulate matter
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSP</ENAMEX>), coefficient of haze (COH), or black smoke (BS) based on
evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM2.5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM10</ENAMEX> are more directly correlated with
adverse health effects than are these other measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>.
Economically valuable health Some health effects, such as forced
expiratory volume and other technical measurements of effects lung
function, are difficult to value in monetary terms. These health
effects are not quantified in this analysis.
Non-overlapping endpoints Although the benefits associated with
each individual health endpoint may be analyzed separately, care
must be exercised in selecting health endpoints to include in the
overall benefits analysis because of the possibility of double
counting of benefits. Including emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> visits in a benefits
analysis that already considers hospital admissions, for example,
will result in double counting of some benefits if the category
"hospital admissions" includes emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> visits.
Concentration-response relationships between a pollutant and a
given health endpoint are applied consistently across all locations
nationwide. This applies to both C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> relationships defined by a
single C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> function and those defined by a pooling of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
functions. Although the C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> relationship may, in fact, vary from
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> location to another (for example, due to differences in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population susceptibilities</ENAMEX> or differences in the composition of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>), locationspecific <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R functions are generally not available. A
single function applied everywhere may result in overestimates of
incidence changes in some locations and underestimates elsewhere,
but these location-specific biases will negate each other, to some
extent, when the total incidence change is calculated. It is not
possible to know the extent or direction of the bias in the total
incidence change based on the general application of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
function everywhere.
C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions may also be estimated with or without explicit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thresholds</ENAMEX>. Air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> levels below the threshold for each
health effect studied are assumed not to cause the effect. When no
threshold is assumed, as is often the case in epidemiological
studies, any exposure level is assumed to pose a non-zero risk of
response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In the benefits
analyses for some recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIAs</ENAMEX> (e.g., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Haze RIA</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx SIP Call RIA</ENAMEX>), the low-end estimate of benefits assumed a
threshold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> health effects at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> :<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">g/m3.</ENAMEX> However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX>,
supported by recent literature addressing this issue (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossi et al.</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>), subsequently advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> that there is
currently no scientific basis for selecting a threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> :<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">g/</ENAMEX>m3
or any other specific threshold for the PM-related health effects
considered in this analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB-Council</ENAMEX>-ADV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99-012</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>).
Therefore, for our benefits analysis, we assume there are no
thresholds for modeling health effects. We do, however, present a
quantitative sensitivity analysis of this assumption in the results
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Effects Institute</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX>) reported findings
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins University</ENAMEX> and others that have
raised concerns about aspects of the statistical methods used in a
number of recent time-series studies of short-term exposures to air
pollution and health effects (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002a</TIMEX>). Some of the
concentration-response functions used in this benefits analysis
were derived from such short-term studies. The estimates derived
from the long-term exposure studies, which account for a major
share of the benefits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>, are not affected. As
discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX> materials provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Scientific Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenbaum</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002b</TIMEX>), these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> found problems in the default "convergence criteria"
used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Generalized Additive Models</ENAMEX> (GAM) and a separate issue
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> identified by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> about the potential to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimate</ENAMEX> standard errors in the same statistical package<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>
These and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have begun to reanalyze the results
of several important time series studies with alternative
approaches that address these issues and have found a downward
revision of some results. For example, the mortality risk estimates
for short-term exposure to PM10 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMMAPS</ENAMEX> were overestimated
(this study was not used in this benefits analysis of fine particle
effects)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX> However, both the relative magnitude and the direction
of bias introduced by the convergence issue are case-specific. In
most cases, the concentration-response relationship may be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overestimated</ENAMEX>; in other cases, it may be underestimated. The
preliminary reanalyses of the mortality and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> components of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMMAPS</ENAMEX> suggest that analyses reporting the lowest relative risks
appear to be affected more greatly by this error than studies
reporting higher relative risks (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominici et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zanobetti</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>).
11Most of the studies used a statistical package known as
"S<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-plus</NUMEX>." For further details, see

for revised mortality results.
Our examination of the original studies used in this analysis
finds that the health endpoints that are potentially affected by
the GAM issues include: reduced hospital admissions in both the
Base and Alternative Estimates; reduced lower respiratory symptoms
in the both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> and Alternative Estimates; and reduced
premature mortality due to short-term PM exposures in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>. While resolution of these issues is likely to
take some time, the preliminary results from ongoing reanalyses of
some of the studies used in our Clear Skies analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominici et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zanobetti</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>, personal
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">communication 2002</ENAMEX>) suggest a more modest effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>-plus
error than reported for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMMAPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM10</ENAMEX> mortality study. While we
wait for further clarification from the scientific community, we
have chosen not to remove these results from the Clear Skies
benefits estimates, nor have we elected to apply any interim
adjustment factor based on the preliminary reanalyses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> will
continue to monitor the progress of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, and make
appropriate adjustments as further information is made
available.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Premature Mortality</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Particulate Matter</ENAMEX>)
Both long and short-term exposures to ambient levels of air
pollution have been associated with increased risk of premature
mortality. The size of the mortality risk estimates from these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiological</ENAMEX> studies, the serious nature of the effect itself,
and the high monetary value ascribed to prolonging life make
mortality risk reduction the most important health endpoint
quantified in this analysis. Because of the importance of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoint</ENAMEX> and the considerable uncertainty among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and
policymakers as to the appropriate way to value reductions in
mortality risks, this section discusses some of the issues
surrounding the estimation of premature mortality. Additional
discussion is found in the section on uncertainties.
Health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have consistently linked air pollution,
especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, with excess mortality. Although a number of
uncertainties remain to be addressed by continued research (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRC</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>), a substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of published scientific literature
recognizes a correlation between elevated PM concentrations and
increased mortality rates. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> types of community epidemiological
studies (involving measures of short-term and long-term exposures
and response) have been used to estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>/ mortality
relationships. Short-term studies relate shortterm (often
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">day-to-day</ENAMEX>) changes in PM concentrations and changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>
mortality rates up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> after a period of elevated PM
concentrations. Long-term studies examine the potential
relationship between longer-term (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one or more years</TIMEX>) exposure
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> mortality rates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> have found
significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> using both types of studies.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over a dozen</NUMEX> studies have found significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between
various measures of long-term exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and elevated rates of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> mortality (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lave</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seskin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozkaynak</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thurston</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>). While most of the published studies found positive
(but not always significant) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with available PM indices
such as total suspended particles (TSP), fine particles components
(i.e. sulfates), and fine particles, exploration of alternative
model specifications sometimes found inconsistencies (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipfert</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>). These early "crosssectional" studies were criticized for a
number of methodological limitations, particularly for inadequate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> at the individual level for variables that are potentially
important in causing mortality, such as wealth, smoking, and diet.
More recently, several new, long-term studies have been published
that use improved approaches and appear to be consistent with the
earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of literature. These new "prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX>" studies
reflect a significant improvement over the earlier work because
they include information on individual information with respect to
measures related to health status and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. The most extensive
study and analyses has been based on data from two prospective
cohort <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, often referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX>-City study"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dockery et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>) and the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX> or ACS
study" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pope et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>); these studies have found consistent
relationships between fine particle indicators and mortality across
multiple locations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> major data set comes from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> based <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7th day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adventist</ENAMEX> study (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey et al</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), which reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between long-term PM exposure
and mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. Results from this cohort, however, have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inconsistent</ENAMEX> and the air quality results are not geographically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. More recently, a cohort of adult
male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> diagnosed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> has been examined
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipfert et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Unlike previous long-term analyses, this
study found some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between mortality and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> but found
inconsistent results for PM indicators.
Given their consistent results and broad applicability to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX>-City and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACS</ENAMEX> data have been of
particular importance in benefits analyses. The credibility of
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies is further enhanced by the fact that they were
subject to extensive reexamination and reanalysis by an independent
scientific analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> compiled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Effects</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krewski et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). The final results of the
reanalysis were then independently peer reviewed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Panel</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI Health Review Committee</ENAMEX>. The results of these reanalyses
confirmed and expanded those of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. This
intensive independent reanalysis effort was occasioned both by the
importance of the original findings as well as concerns that the
underlying individual health effects information has never been
made publicly available. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX> re-examination lends credibility
to the original studies but also found unexpected sensitivities
concerning (a) which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> are most important, (b) the role of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> in mediating the association between pollution and
mortality, and (c) the magnitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> depending on
how spatial correlation was handled. Further confirmation and
extension of the overall findings using more recent air quality and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACS</ENAMEX> health information was recently published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical Association</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pope et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). In general, the
risk estimates based on the long-term mortality studies are
substantially greater than those derived from short-term
studies.
In developing and improving the methods for estimating and
valuing the potential reductions in mortality risk over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> has consulted with a panel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Advisory Board</ENAMEX>. That
panel recommended use of long-term prospective cohort studies in
estimating mortality risk reduction (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-99-005</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). More specifically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> recommended emphasis on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>) because it includes a much larger sample size and longer
exposure interval, and covers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> locations (e.g. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>
compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> examined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> data) than other
studies of its kind. As explained in the regulatory impact analysis
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel</ENAMEX> rule (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>), more
recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> benefits analyses have relied on an improved
specification from this data set that was developed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX>
reanalysis of this study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krewski et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). The particular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specification</ENAMEX> estimated a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R function based on changes in mean
levels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PM2.5</NUMEX>, as opposed to the function in the original study,
which used median levels. This specification also includes a
broader geographic scope than the original study (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> versus
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> has recently agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s selection of this
specification for use in analyzing mortality benefits of PM
reductions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-01-004</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). For these reasons,
the present analysis uses the same Concentration-Response function
in developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> of mortality benefits.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>
To reflect concerns about the inherent limitations in the number
of studies supporting a causal association between long-term
exposure and mortality, an Alternative benefit estimate was derived
from the large number of time-series studies that have established
a likely causal relationship between short-term measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and
daily mortality statistics. A particular strength of such studies
is the fact that potential confounding variables such as
socio-economic status, occupation, and smoking do not vary on a
day-to-day basis in an individual area. A number of multi-city and
other types of studies strongly suggest that these
effects-relationships cannot be explained by weather, statistical
approaches, or other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>. The risk estimates from the vast
majority of the short-term studies include the effects of only one
or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> exposure to air pollution. More recently, several
studies have found that the practice of examining the effects on a
single day basis may significantly understate the risk of
short-term exposures (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zanobetti et al</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>). These
studies suggest that the short-term risk can double when the
single-day effects are combined with the cumulative impact of
exposures over multiple <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> prior to a mortality
event.
The fact that the PM-mortality coefficients from the cohort
studies are far larger than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coefficients</ENAMEX> derived from the daily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time-series</ENAMEX> studies provides some evidence for an independent
chronic effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PM pollution</ENAMEX> on health. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>
presumes that the larger coefficients represent a more complete
accounting of mortality effects, including both the cumulative
total of short-term mortality as well as an additional chronic
effect. This is, however, not the only possible interpretation of
the disparity. Various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> have argued that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the long-term
estimates may be biased high and/or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>) the short-term estimates may
be biased low. In this view, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> study types could be measuring
the same underlying relationship.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reviewers</ENAMEX> have noted some possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of upward bias in the
long-term studies. Some have noted that the less robust estimates
based on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cities Study</ENAMEX> are significantly higher than those
based on the more broadly distributed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACS</ENAMEX> data sets. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>
have also noted that the observed mortality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> from the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980's and 90</TIMEX>'s may reflect higher pollution exposures from the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950's to 1960</TIMEX>'s. While this would bias estimates based on more
recent pollution levels upwards, it also would imply a truly
long-term chronic effect of pollution.
With regard to possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of downward bias, it is of note
that the recent studies suggest that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">single day time</TIMEX> series
studies may understate the short-term effect on the order of a
factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. These considerations provide a basis for considering
an Alternative Estimate using the most recent estimates from the
wealth of time-series studies, in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> based on the
long-term cohort studies.
In essence, the Alternative Estimate addresses the above noted
uncertainties about the relationship between premature mortality
and long-term exposures to ambient levels of fine particles by
assuming that there is no mortality effect of chronic exposures to
fine particles. Instead, it assumes that the full impact of fine
particles on premature mortality can be captured using a
concentration-response function relating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> mortality to
short-term fine particle levels. Specifically, a
concentration-response function based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwartz et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) is
employed, with an adjustment to account for recent evidence that
daily mortality is associated with particle levels from a number of
previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> mortality studies
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwartz et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) examined the impact of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PM2.5</NUMEX> on mortality
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single day</TIMEX> or over the average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or more days</TIMEX>. Recent
analyses have found that impacts of elevated PM2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given day</TIMEX>
can <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">elevate</ENAMEX> mortality on a number of following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samet et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Multi-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are often referred to
as "distributed lag" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> because they assume that mortality
following a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> event will be distributed over a number of days
following or "lagging" the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> event. 13
There are no PM2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> mortality studies which report numeric
estimates of relative risks from distributed lag <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>; only PM10
studies are available. Daily mortality C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PM10</TIMEX> are
consistently lower in magnitude than PM2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>-mortality C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions,
because fine particles are believed to be more closely associated
with mortality than the coarse fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>. Given that the
emissions reductions under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> result primarily in
reduced ambient concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PM2.5</NUMEX>, use of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PM10</TIMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
function results in a significant downward bias in the estimated
reductions in mortality. To account for the full potential
multi-day mortality impact of acute PM2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> events, we use the
distributed lag model for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PM10</TIMEX> reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) to
develop an adjustment factor which we then apply to the
PM2.5 based C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> function reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwartz et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>).
If most of the increase in mortality is expected to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the fine fraction of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PM10</TIMEX>, then it is reasonable to
assume that the same proportional increase in risk would be
observed if a distributed lag <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> were applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM2.5</ENAMEX> data.
The distributed lag adjustment factor is constructed as the ratio
of the estimated coefficient from the unconstrained distributed lag
model to the estimated coefficient from the single-lag model
reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). The unconstrained distributed lag
model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coefficient</ENAMEX> estimate is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0012818</NUMEX> and the single-lag model
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> estimate is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0006479</NUMEX>. The ratio of these estimates is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9784</NUMEX>. This adjustment factor is then multiplied by the estimated
coefficients from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwartz et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) study. There are two
relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coefficients</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwartz et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) study, one
corresponding to all-cause mortality, and one corresponding to
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</ENAMEX> (COPD) mortality (separation
by cause is necessary to implement the life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> lost approach
detailed below). The adjusted estimates for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R functions
are:
All cause mortality = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001489</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">* 1.9784</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.002946</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">COPD</ENAMEX> mortality = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003246</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">* 1.9784</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.006422</NUMEX>
Note that these estimates, while approximating the full impact
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> levels on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> death counts, do not capture any
impacts of long-term exposure to air pollution. As discussed
earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Advisory Board</ENAMEX>, while acknowledging the
uncertainties in estimation of a PM-mortality relationship, has
repeatedly recommended the use of a study that
13 As discussed above, based on recent preliminary findings from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Effects Institute</ENAMEX>, the magnitude of mortality from
shorttern exposure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>) and hospital/<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX>
admissions estimates (both estimates) may be either under or
overestimated by an uncertain amount.
does reflect the impacts of long-term exposure. The omission of
long-term impacts accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40 percent</NUMEX> reduction
in the estimate of avoided premature mortality in the Alternative
Estimate relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chronic Bronchitis</ENAMEX>
Chronic bronchitis is characterized by mucus in the lungs and a
persistent wet cough for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least three months a year</TIMEX> for several
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years in a row</TIMEX>. Chronic bronchitis affects <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated five</NUMEX>
percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Lung Association</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). A
limited number of studies have estimated the impact of air
pollution on new incidences of chronic bronchitis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>)
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>) provide evidence that long-term PM
exposure leads to the development of chronic bronchitis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Following the same approaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 812</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospective Report</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999a</TIMEX>), this analysis pooled estimates from these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies
to develop a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R function linking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> to chronic bronchitis. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>) study examined the relationship between exposure to
PM10 and prevalence of chronic bronchitis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>)
study examined the relationship between PM2.5 and new incidences of
chronic bronchitis. Both studies have strengths and weaknesses,
which suggest that pooling the effect estimates from each study,
may provide a better estimate of the expected change in incidences
of chronic bronchitis than using either study alone.
It should be noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> used data on the prevalence of
chronic bronchitis, not its incidence. Following the approach of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 812</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospective Report</ENAMEX>, we estimated the percentage
change in the prevalence rate for chronic bronchitis using the
estimated coefficient from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>'s study in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R function, and
then applied this percentage change to a baseline incidence rate
obtained from another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. For example, if the prevalence
declines by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> with a drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, then baseline incidence
drops by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> with the same drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>.
Visibility Benefits
As the name chosen for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> implies, one of the
direct consequences of the reductions in fine particles that
accompany implementation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SO2</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOx</ENAMEX> emissions caps is an
improvement in atmospheric clarity and visibility. Changes in the
emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SO2</ENAMEX> and NOx caused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> will change
the level of visibility in much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S</ENAMEX> by reducing
concentrations of sulfate and nitrate particles. Fine particles
absorb and scatter light, impairing visibility. Visibility directly
affects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s enjoyment of a variety of daily activities both in
the places they live and work and in the places they travel to for
recreation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> recognizes visibility as an important
public good in naming visibility as one of the aspects of public
welfare to be protected in setting secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAAQS</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Sections</ENAMEX> 165
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> places particular value on protecting visibility
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156</NUMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and wilderness areas (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shenandoah</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acadia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Canyon</ENAMEX>) that are termed class I Federal areas. As
noted above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> modeling estimates regional and national
visibility improvements associated with Clear Skies. As discussed
in a subsequent section, this analysis also provides partial
estimates of the potential economic value of these visibility
improvements.
A number of related measures can be used to measure changes in
visibility associated with reduced fine particle concentrations. A
key such measure is light "extinction," a measure of the amount of
light scattered and absorbed by particles suspended in air. This
light scattering and absorption reduces atmospheric clarity and is
perceived as haze. Changes in fine particulate mass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are
used directly to estimate changes in extinction. Decreasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extinction</ENAMEX> (in units of inverse distance) can in turn be used to
estimate quantitative measures more directly related to human
perception such as contrast of distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> and visual range.
More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisler</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>) created a unitless measure of
visibility based directly on the degree of measured light
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorption</ENAMEX> called the deciview. Deciviews, like the analagous term
decibel, employ a logarithmic scale to evaluate relative changes in
visibility that is more directly related to human perception.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sisler</ENAMEX> characterized a change in light extinction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> deciview
as "a small but perceptible scenic change under many
circumstances." For this analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REMSAD</ENAMEX> version <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.40</NUMEX> was used to
predict the change in visibility, measured in deciviews and
presented graphically, of the areas affected by the Clear Skies
Act.



Economic Valuation of Benefits
The overall approach applied in our estimates of the benefits of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> closely parallels that used in prior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 812</ENAMEX> series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reports</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 and 1999</TIMEX>) and the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel</ENAMEX>
Fuel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RIA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). As in those analyses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> has not
conducted extensive new primary research to measure economic
benefits for individual rulemakings. As a result, our estimates are
based on the best available methods of benefits transfer. Benefits
transfer is the science and art of adapting primary benefits
research from similar contexts to obtain the most accurate measure
of benefits for the environmental quality change under analysis.
Where appropriate, we have made adjustments to existing primary
research for the level of environmental quality change, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sociodemographic</ENAMEX> and economic characteristics of the affected
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and other factors in order to improve the accuracy and
robustness of benefits estimates.
In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> tend to view an individual's
willingness-to-pay (WTP) for an improvement in environmental
quality as the most complete and appropriate measure of the value
of an environmental or health risk reduction. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s
willingness-to-accept (WTA) compensation for not receiving the
improvement is also a valid measure. Willingness to pay and
Willingness to accept are comparable measures when the change in
environmental quality is small and there are reasonably close
substitutes available. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> is generally considered to be a
more readily measurable and conservative measure of benefits.
Adoption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> as the measure of value implies that the value of
environmental quality improvements is dependent on the individual
preferences of the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and that the existing
distribution of income (ability to pay) is appropriate.
Our analysis relies on up-to-date reviews of the relevant
resource economics literature that provides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> values for health
risk reductions and visibility improvements similar to those that
will be provided by implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. Exhibit
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> provides a summary of the base <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> values used to generate
estimates of the economic value of avoided health effects for this
analysis, adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1999 dollars</NUMEX>, and a brief description of the
basis for these values. Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> provides a summary of the
monetary values for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> used for economic
valuation of mortality and chronic bronchitis. For these two
endpoints, the Alternative Estimate valuation differs from the Base
Estimate values.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> that follow, we discuss in greater detail the
basis for generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for premature mortality risk reductions
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for reductions in the risk of contracting chronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchitis</ENAMEX> and the basis for making adjustments to unit values to
make them more applicable to the air pollution reductions we
anticipate from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. The mortality and chronic
bronchitis health endpoints are the most influential in our
estimation of monetized benefits, because they account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 95</NUMEX>
percent of the total estimated monetized benefits of the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX>. In addition, we provide a brief summary of our approach
to valuing visibility and agricultural yield improvements. Detailed
descriptions of the basis for other economic valuation methods can
be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter VII</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel RIA</ENAMEX>

Valuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Premature Mortality</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>
The monetary benefit of reducing premature mortality risk was
estimated using the "value of statistical lives saved" (VSL)
approach, although the actual valuation is of small changes in
mortality risk experienced by a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The VSL
approach applies information from several published value-of-life
studies, which themselves examine tradeoffs of monetary
compensation for small additional mortality risks, to determine a
reasonable benefit of preventing premature mortality. The mean
value of avoiding one statistical death (i.e., the statistical
incidence of a single death, equivalent to a product of a
population risk times a population size that equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>) is
estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> dollars. This represents an
intermediate value from a range of estimates that appear in the
economics literature, and it is a value the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> uses in rulemaking
support analyses and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 812</ENAMEX> Reports to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
This estimate is the mean of a distribution fitted to the
estimates from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26</NUMEX> value-of-life studies identified in the Section
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">812</NUMEX> reports as "applicable to policy analysis." The approach and
set of selected studies mirrors that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) (with the
addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies), and uses the same criteria as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi</ENAMEX> in
his review of value-of-life studies. The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million</NUMEX> estimate is
consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi</ENAMEX>'s conclusion (updated to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$</NUMEX>) that "most
of the reasonable estimates of the value of life are clustered in
the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.7 to $8.6 million</NUMEX> range." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> studies are
contingent valuation (CV) studies, which directly solicit WTP
information from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>; the rest are wage-risk studies, which
base WTP estimates on estimates of the additional compensation
demanded in the labor market for riskier jobs, controlling for
other job and employee characteristics such as education and
experience. As indicated in the previous section on quantification
of premature mortality benefits, we assume for this analysis that
some of the incidences of premature mortality related to PM
exposures occur in a distributed fashion over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the five years</TIMEX>
following exposure. To take this into account in the valuation of
reductions in premature mortality, we apply an annual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> percent
discount rate to the value of premature mortality occurring in
future <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.14</NUMEX>
The economics literature concerning the appropriate method for
valuing reductions in premature mortality risk is still developing.
The adoption of a value for the projected reduction in the risk of
premature mortality is the subject of continuing discussion within
the economic and public policy analysis community. Regardless of
the theoretical economic considerations, distinctions in the
monetary value assigned to the lives saved were not drawn, even if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations differed</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, health status, socioeconomic status,
gender or other characteristics.
Following the advice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEAC</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> approach
was used to calculate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> of mortality benefits
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-SAB-EEAC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00-013</NUMEX>). While there are several differences between
the risk context implicit in labor market studies we use to derive
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> estimate and the particulate matter air pollution context
addressed here, those differences in the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and
the nature of the risks imply both upward and downward adjustments.
For example, adjusting for age differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the
economic studies and those affected by air pollution may imply the
need to adjust the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million VSL</NUMEX> downward, but the involuntary
nature of air pollution-related risks and the lower level of
risk-aversion of the manual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> in the labor market studies
may imply the need for upward adjustments. In certain cases, labor
market studies have not adequately controlled for non-fatal injury
risks and other unfavorable job attributes (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">e.g. dirt</ENAMEX> and noise).
These factors may increase the estimated risk premium for
reductions in premature mortality risk.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> emphasize that the value of a statistical life
is not a single number relevant for all situations. Indeed, the VSL
estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1999 dollars</NUMEX>) is itself the central
tendency of a number of estimates of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> for some rather
narrowly defined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. When there are significant
differences between the population affected by a particular health
risk and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> used in the labor market studies, as is
the case here, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> prefer to adjust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> estimate to
reflect those differences. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CV</ENAMEX>-based estimates of VSL
collectively may better represent the population affected by
pollution than the labor market studies.
There is general agreement that the value to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> of a
reduction in mortality risk can vary based on several factors,
including the age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, the type of risk, the level of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> has over the risk, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s
attitudes towards risk, and the health status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>.
While the empirical basis for adjusting the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 million</NUMEX> VSL for many
of these factors does not yet exist, a thorough discussion of these
uncertainties is included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guidelines for Preparing</ENAMEX>
Economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Analyses</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000a</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> recognizes the need
for investigation by the scientific community to develop additional
empirical support for adjustments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> for the factors mentioned
above.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> The choice of a discount rate, and its associated conceptual
basis, is a topic of ongoing discussion within the federal
government. We adopted a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX> discount rate for our Base
analysis in this case to reflect reliance on a "social rate of time
preference" discounting concept. We have also calculated benefits
using a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> rate consistent with an "opportunity cost of
capital" concept to reflect the time value of resources directed to
meet regulatory requirements. In this analysis, the benefit
estimates were not significantly affected by the choice of discount
rate. Further discussion of this topic appears in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guidelines</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preparing Economic Analyses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">240</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00-003</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.
As further support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB-EEAC</ENAMEX> advised
in their recent report that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> "continue to use a
wage-risk-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> as its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>, including appropriate
sensitivity analyses to reflect the uncertainty of these
estimates," and that "the only risk characteristic for which
adjustments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> can be made is the timing of the
risk"(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-SAB-EEAC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00-013</NUMEX>). In developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate of the</ENAMEX>
benefits of premature mortality reductions, we have discounted over
the lag period between exposure and premature mortality. However,
in accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> advice, we use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> in the Base
Estimate and present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> adjusted values in the tables of
alternative calculations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit 12</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> reflects the impact of changes to key
assumptions associated with the valuation of mortality. These
include: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the impact of using wage-risk and contingent
valuation-based value of statistical life estimates in valuing risk
reductions from air pollution as opposed to contingent
valuation-based estimates alone, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the relationship between age
and willingness-to-pay for fatal risk reductions, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) the degree
of prematurity in mortalities from air pollution.
The Alternative Estimate addresses this issue by using an
estimate of the value of statistical life that is based only on the
set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> contingent valuation studies included in the larger set
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> studies recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viscusi</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) as applicable to policy
analysis. The mean of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> contingent valuation based VSL
estimates is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.7 million</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$</NUMEX>), which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 60</NUMEX>
percent of the mean value of the full set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> studies.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> issue is addressed by assuming that the relationship
between age and willingness-to-pay for fatal risk reductions can be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximated</ENAMEX> using an adjustment factor derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> has advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> that the appropriate way to
account for age differences is to obtain the values for risk
reductions from the age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> affected by the risk reduction.
Several studies have found a significant effect of age on the value
of mortality risk reductions expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>).
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of these studies provide the basis to form ratios of the WTP
of different age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> to a base age cohort of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</TIMEX>. These
ratios can be used to provide Alternative age-adjusted estimates of
the value of avoided premature mortalities. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> problem with both
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> studies is that they examine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> for a limited age
range. They then fit VSL as a function of age and extrapolate
outside the range of the data to obtain ratios for the very old.
Unfortunately, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> is specified as quadratic in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extrapolation</ENAMEX> beyond the range of the data can lead to a very
severe decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> at ages beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX>.
A simpler and potentially less biased approach is to simply
apply a single age adjustment based on whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> was
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">or under 65 years of age</TIMEX> at the time of death. This is
consistent with the range of observed ages in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> studies
and also agrees with the findings of more recent studies by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krupnick et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) that the only significant difference in WTP
is between the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 70 and under 70</TIMEX> age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. To correct for the
potential extrapolation error for ages beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX>, the adjustment
factor is selected as the ratio of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s WTP
to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.63</NUMEX>, based on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones-Lee</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>) results and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.92</NUMEX> based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>)
results. To show the maximum impact of the age adjustment, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> is based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>) adjustment
factor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.63</NUMEX>, which yields a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.3 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 70</TIMEX>. Deaths of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> under the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> are
valued using the unadjusted mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.7 million</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$</NUMEX>).
Since these are acute mortalities, it is assumed that there is no
lag between reduced exposure and reduced risk of mortality.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones-Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krupnick</ENAMEX> may understate the effect of age because
they only control for income and do not control for wealth. While
there is no empirical evidence to support or reject hypotheses
regarding wealth and observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for additional life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> may in part reflect their wealth position vis a vis
middle age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> issue is addressed by assuming that deaths from
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</ENAMEX> (COPD) are advanced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, and deaths from all other causes are advanced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX>.
These reductions in life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> lost are applied regardless of the
age at death. Actuarial evidence suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
serious preexisting cardiovascular conditions have a remaining life
expectancy of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX>. While many deaths from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> exposure
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> may occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX>, studies
have shown relationships between all cause mortality and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, and
between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and mortality from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). In
addition, recent studies have shown a relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and
non-fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attacks</ENAMEX>, which suggests that some of the deaths due
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> may be due to fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attacks</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peters et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). And,
a recent meta-analysis has shown little effect of age on the
relative risk from PM exposure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stieb et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>), which suggests
that the number of deaths in non-elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (and thus the
potential for greater loss of life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>) may be significant.
Indeed, this analysis estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 percent</NUMEX> of non-COPD
premature deaths avoided are in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 65</TIMEX>. Thus, while
the assumption of 5 years of life lost may be appropriate for a
subset of total avoided premature mortalities, it may over or
underestimate the degree of life shortening attributable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> for
the remaining deaths."
In order to value the expected life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> lost for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-COPD</ENAMEX> deaths, we need to construct estimates of the value of a
statistical life year. The value of a life year varies based on the
age at death, due to the differences in the base VSL between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>
and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under 65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The valuation
approach used is a value of statistical life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (VSLY) approach,
based on amortizing the base VSL for each age cohort. Previous
applications have arrived at a single value per life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> based on
the discounted stream of values that correspond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999a</TIMEX>). This assumes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 years</TIMEX> of life
lost is the base value associated with the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.7</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$</NUMEX>). The VSLY associated with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.7 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> is
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$163,000</NUMEX>, annualized assuming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s guideline value of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX>
discount rate, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$270,000</NUMEX>, annualized assuming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s guideline
value of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> discount rate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> applied in this
analysis is then built up from that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSLY</ENAMEX> by taking the present
value of the stream of life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, again assuming a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> discount
rate. Thus, if you assume that a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 year-old</TIMEX> dying from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
would lose 5 years of life, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> applied to that death would be
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.79 million</NUMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65</TIMEX>, we then develop a VSLY
from the age-adjusted base VSL of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.3 million</NUMEX>. Given an assumed
remaining life expectancy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>, this gives a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSLY</ENAMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$258,000</NUMEX>, assuming a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX> discount rate. Again, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> is
built based on the present value of 5 years of lost life, so in
this case, we have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 year</TIMEX> old individual dying from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
losing 5 years of life, implying an estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.25 million</NUMEX>.
As a final step, these estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> values are multiplied by the
appropriate adjustment factors to account for changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, as outlined above.
Applying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSLY</ENAMEX> approach to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories of acute
mortality results in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> separate sets of values for an avoided
premature mortality based on age and cause of death. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Non-COPD</ENAMEX>
deaths for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 65 and older</TIMEX> are valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.4 million</NUMEX>
per incidence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.6 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Non-COPD</ENAMEX> deaths
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 64</TIMEX> and younger are valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.88 million</NUMEX> per
incidence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.0 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> deaths for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 65 and older</TIMEX> are valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.15 million</NUMEX> per
incidence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.17 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX> deaths
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 64</TIMEX> and younger are valued at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.096 million</NUMEX>
per incidence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.11 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. The implied VSL
for younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> is less than that for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
because the value per life year is higher for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
Since we assume that there is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> loss in life <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> for a PM
related mortality, regardless of the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> dying, this
necessarily leads to a lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> for younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Valuation of Avoided Cases of Chronic</ENAMEX> Bronchitis
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>
The best available estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid a case of chronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchitis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX>) comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi, et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi, et</ENAMEX>
al. study, however, describes a severe case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> to the survey
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. We therefore employ an estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid a
pollution-related case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX>, based on adjusting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi, et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>) estimate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid a severe case. This is done
to account for the likelihood that an average case of
pollution-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> is not as severe. The adjustment is made by
applying the elasticity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> with respect to severity reported in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krupnick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cropper</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>) study. Details of this adjustment
procedure can be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel RIA</ENAMEX> and
its supporting documentation, and in the most recent Section 812
study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>).
We use the mean of a distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> estimates as the
central tendency estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid a pollution-related case
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> in this analysis. The distribution incorporates uncertainty
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid a case of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX>, as
described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi, et al.</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the severity level of an average
pollution-related case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> (relative to that of the case
described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi, et al.</ENAMEX>); and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the elasticity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> with
respect to severity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Based on assumptions about the
distributions of each of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> uncertain components, we
derive a distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid a pollution-related case of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX> by statistical uncertainty analysis techniques. The expected
value (i.e., mean) of this distribution, which is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $331,000</NUMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$</NUMEX>), is taken as the central tendency estimate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid
a PM-related case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>, a cost-of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> value is used in
place of willingness-to-pay to reflect uncertainty about the value
of reductions in incidences of chronic bronchitis. In the Base
Estimate, the willingness-to-pay estimate was derived from two
contingent valuation studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viscusi et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krupnick</ENAMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cropper, 1992</TIMEX>). These studies were experimental studies intended to
examine new methodologies for eliciting values for morbidity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX>. Although these studies were not specifically designed
for policy analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-00-002</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) has
indicated that the severity-adjusted values from this study provide
reasonable estimates of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for avoidance of chronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchitis</ENAMEX>. As with other contingent valuation studies, the
reliability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> estimates depends on the methods used to
obtain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> values. In order to investigate the impact of using
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> estimates, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> relies on a
value for incidence of chronic bronchitis using a cost-of-illness
estimate based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cropper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krupnick</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>) which calculates the
present value of the lifetime expected costs associated with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. The current cost-of-illness (COI) estimate for chronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronchitis</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $107,000</NUMEX> per case, compared with the current
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$330,000</NUMEX>.
Valuation of Changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Visibility</ENAMEX>
Estimating benefits for visibility is a more difficult and less
precise exercise than estimating health benefits because the
endpoints are not directly or indirectly valued in markets. The
contingent valuation (CV) method has been employed in the economics
literature to value endpoint changes for visibility (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowe</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990a</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990b</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestnut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). The CV method
values endpoints by using carefully structured surveys to ask a
sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> what amount of compensation is equivalent to a
given change in environmental quality. There is an extensive
scientific literature and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of practice on both the theory and
technique of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> believes that well-designed and
well-executed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> studies are valid for estimating the benefits of
air quality regulation. 15
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> value visibility both in the places they live and
work (referred to as residential visibility), and in the places
they travel to for recreational purposes (referred to as
recreational visibility). Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> studies that address both
types of visibility exist, in our analysis we rely only on
recreational visibility studies, as explained further below.
We considered benefits from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories of visibility
changes: residential visibility and recreational visibility.
Residential visibility benefits are those that occur from
visibility changes in urban, suburban, and rural areas, and also in
recreational areas not listed as federal Class I areas.16 For the
purposes of this analysis, recreational visibility improvements are
defined as those that occur specifically in federal Class I areas.
A key distinction between recreational and residential benefits is
that only those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in residential areas are assumed to
receive benefits from residential visibility, while all households
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> are assumed to derive some benefit from improvements in
Class I areas.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> existing studies provide defensible monetary estimates
of the value of visibility
15Concerns about the reliability of value estimates from CV
studies arose because research has shown that bias can be
introduced easily into these studies if they are not carefully
conducted. Accurately measuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for avoided health and welfare
losses depends on the reliability and validity of the data
collected. There are several issues to consider when evaluating
study quality, including but not limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) whether the sample
estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> WTP; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
whether the good to be valued is comprehended and accepted by the
respondent; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> elicitation format is designed to
minimize strategic responses; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> is sensitive to

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McClelland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>) and the other is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> survey on
recreational visibility value (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowe</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1990b</ENAMEX>).
Both utilize the contingent valuation method. There has been a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> deal of controversy and significant development of both
theoretical and empirical knowledge about how to conduct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> surveys
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s judgment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut and Rowe</ENAMEX> study
contains many of the elements of a valid CV study and is
sufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for monetary estimates
of the benefits of visibility changes in recreational areas.17 This
study serves as an essential input to our estimates of the benefits
of recreational visibility improvements. Consistent with SAB
advice, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> has designated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McClelland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> study as
significantly less reliable for regulatory benefit-cost analysis,
although it does provide useful estimates on the order of magnitude
of residential visibility benefits (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-00-002</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). Residential visibility benefits are therefore only included
as part of our sensitivity tests. The methods for this calculation
are similar to the procedure for recreational benefits.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut and Rowe</ENAMEX> study measured the demand for visibility
in Class I areas managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park Service</ENAMEX> (NPS) in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were asked about their
willingness to pay to protect national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> or NPS-managed
wilderness areas within a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>. The survey used
photographs reflecting different visibility levels in the specified
recreational areas. The visibility levels in these photographs were
later converted to deciviews for the current analysis. The survey
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collected were used to estimate a WTP equation for improved
visibility. In addition to the visibility change variable, the
estimating equation also included household income as an
explanatory variable.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut and Rowe</ENAMEX> study did not measure values for
visibility improvement in Class I areas outside the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> regions.
Their study covered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">156</NUMEX> Class I areas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> We can
infer the value of visibility changes in the other Class I areas by
transferring values of visibility changes at Class I areas in the
study regions. However, these values are not as defensible and are
thus presented only as a sensitivity calculation.
The estimated relationship from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Che</ENAMEX> stnut and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowe</ENAMEX> study is
only directly applicable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> represented by survey
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>. We used benefits transfer methods to extrapolate these
results to the population affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. A

An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> advisory letter indicates that "many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
Council believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut and Rowe</ENAMEX> study is the best
available." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-00-002</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>) However, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> did not formally approve use of these estimates because
of concerns about the peer-reviewed status of the study. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
believes the study has received adequate review and has been cited
in numerous peerreviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis</ENAMEX>,

to pay equation for improved visibility (measured in deciviews)
was developed as a function of the baseline level of visibility,
the magnitude of the visibility improvement, and household income.
The behavioral parameters of this equation were taken from analysis
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut and Rowe</ENAMEX> data. These parameters were used to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibrate WTP</ENAMEX> for the visibility changes resulting from the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX>. The method for developing calibrated WTP functions is
based on the approach developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). Available
evidence indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are willing to pay more for a
given visibility improvement as their income increases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). The benefits estimates here incorporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chestnut</ENAMEX>'s estimate
that a one <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> increase in income is associated with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>
percent increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for a given change in visibility.
For the sensitivity test calculation for residential visibility,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McClelland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> study's results were used to calculate the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> to measure the effect of deciview changes on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX>. The WTP
equation was then run for the population affected by the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agricultural Benefits</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ozone Criteria Document</ENAMEX> notes that "ozone affects vegetation
throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, impairing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native vegetation</ENAMEX>,
and ecosystems more than any other air pollutant" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>).
Reduced levels of ground-level ozone resulting from the final Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX> will have generally beneficial results on agricultural
crop yields and commercial forest growth. Welldeveloped techniques
exist to provide monetary estimates of these benefits to
agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. These techniques use models
of planting decisions, yield response functions, and agricultural
product supply and demand. The resulting welfare measures are based
on predicted changes in market prices and production costs.
Laboratory and field experiments have shown reductions in yields
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">agronomic crops</ENAMEX> exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> (e.g.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lettuce</ENAMEX>) and field <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> (e.g., cotton and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>). The most
extensive field experiments, conducted under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Crop Loss</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment Network</ENAMEX> (NCLAN), examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and numerous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultivars</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCLAN</ENAMEX> results show that "several economically
important <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crop species</ENAMEX> are sensitive to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> levels typical of
those found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>). In addition, economic
studies have shown a relationship between observed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> levels and
crop yields (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>).
To estimate changes in crop yields, we used biological
exposure-response information derived from controlled experiments
conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCLAN</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCLAN</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>). For the purpose of our
analysis, we analyze changes for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> most economically
significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> for which C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions are available: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanuts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorghum</ENAMEX>, soybean, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>.18 For some
crops there are multiple C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions, some more sensitive to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> and some less. Our estimate assumes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> are evenly
mixed between relatively sensitive and relatively insensitive
varieties.
We analyzed the economic value associated with varying levels of
yield loss for ozonesensitive commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGSIM</ENAMEX>

analyzing the effects of changes in policies that affect commodity
crop yields or production costs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX>
The measure of benefits calculated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is the net
change in consumer and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> surplus from baseline ozone
concentrations to the ozone concentrations resulting from
attainment of particular standards. Using the baseline and
post-control equilibria, the model calculates the change in net
consumer and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> surplus on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>-by-crop basis<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> Dollar
values are aggregated across <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> for each standard. The total
dollar value represents a measure of the change in social welfare
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Adjustments for Changes in Income Over Time</ENAMEX>
Recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> deliberations on mortality and morbidity valuation
approaches suggest that some adjustments to unit values are
appropriate to reflect economic theory (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-SAB-EEAC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00-013</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>).
As noted above, we apply one adjustment by discounting lagged
mortality incidence effects. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> adjustment is conducted as
part of the mortality, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX>, and visibility valuation
procedures to incorporate the effect of changes in income over time
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX>. To estimate the effects of changes in income over time we
use a procedure originally outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix H</ENAMEX> of the Section
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">812</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospective Report</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). That procedure uses
per capita income estimates generated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>
projections of income and population growth, and applies three
different income elasticities for mortality, severe morbidity, and
light symptom effects<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX>
Benefits for each of the categories - minor health effects,
severe and chronic health effects (which include chronic bronchitis
and premature mortality), and visibility - were adjusted by
multiplying the unadjusted benefits by the appropriate adjustment
factor, listed in Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 below</NUMEX>.
19AGSIM© is designed to forecast agricultural supply and demand
out to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. We were not able to adapt the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to forecast out to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. Instead, we apply percentage increases in yields from
decreased ambient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020 to 2010</TIMEX> yield levels, and
input these into an agricultural sector model held at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> levels
of demand and supply. It is uncertain what impact this assumption
will have on net changes in surplus.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agricultural</ENAMEX> benefits differ from other health and welfare
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX> in the length of the assumed ozone season. For
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agriculture</ENAMEX>, the ozone season is assumed to extend from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. This assumption is made to ensure proper calculation of
the ozone statistic used in the exposure-response functions. The
only crop affected by changes in ozone during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> is winter
wheat.
21 Note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Economics Advisory Committee</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEAC</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> to adjust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for increases in real
income over time, but not to adjust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to account for
cross-sectional income differences "because of the sensitivity of
making such distinctions, and because of insufficient evidence
available at present" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-SAB-EEAC-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00-013</NUMEX>).

(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). Also note that no adjustments were made to
benefits based on the cost-of-illness approach or to work loss
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. This assumption will also lead us to underpredict benefits
since it is likely that increases in real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> income would also
result in increased cost-of-illness (due, for example, to increases
in wages paid to medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>) and increased cost of work loss
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> (reflecting that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> incomes are higher, the losses
resulting from reduced worker production would also be higher). The
result of applying these adjustment factors is an updated set of
unit economic values used in the valuation step. We summarize these
adjusted values in Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAJOR UNCERTAINTIES</ENAMEX> IN BENEFITS ANALYSIS
The estimates of avoided health effects, improved visibility,
and monetary benefits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> are based on a method
that reflects peer-reviewed data, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and approaches that are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> rulemakings and generate Reports to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
on the benefits of air pollution regulation. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> has made
a concerted effort to apply well-accepted methods, there remain
significant uncertainties in the estimation of these benefits.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of uncertainty that affect these
estimates:

In the remainder of this section, we discuss the major sources
of each of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories of uncertainty related to the
estimate of avoided health effects, avoided ecological effects, and
monetary valuation of these benefits. Our analysis of the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX> has not included formal uncertainty analyses, although we
have conducted several sensitivity tests and have analyzed a full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uncertainties Associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Benefit Estimates</ENAMEX>
Within-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study Variation</ENAMEX>
Within-study variation refers to the precision with which a
given study estimates the relationship between air quality changes
and health effects. Health effects studies provide both a "best
estimate" of this relationship plus a measure of the statistical
uncertainty of the relationship. This size of this uncertainty
depends on factors such as the number of subjects studied and the
size of the effect being measured. The results of even the most
well designed epidemiological studies are characterized by this
type of uncertainty, though well-designed studies typically report
narrower uncertainty bounds around the best estimate than do
studies of lesser quality. In selecting health endpoints, we
generally focus on endpoints where a statistically significant
relationship has been observed, which by definition assures a
reasonably
44
tight confidence interval around the best estimate of the mean
concentration-response relationship.
Across-study Variation
Across-study variation refers to the fact that different
published studies of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pollutant</ENAMEX>/health effect relationship
typically do not report identical findings; in some instances the
differences are substantial. These differences can exist even
between equally reputable studies and may result in health effect
estimates that vary considerably. Across-study variation can result
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible causes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possibility is that studies report
different estimates of the single true relationship between a given
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pollutant</ENAMEX> and a health effect due to differences in study design,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> chance, or other factors. For example, a hypothetical study
conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and one conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> may report
different C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions for the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and
mortality, in part because of differences between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> study
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> (e.g., demographics, activity patterns). Alternatively,
study results may differ because these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies are in fact
estimating different relationships; that is, the same reduction in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> may result in different reductions in
premature mortality. This may result from a number of factors, such
as differences in the relative sensitivity of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
to PM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> and differences in the composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> in these
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> locations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> In either case, where we identified multiple
studies that are appropriate for estimating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> health effect,
we generated a pooled estimate of results from each of those
studies.
Application of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-R Relationship Nationwide</ENAMEX>
Whether this analysis estimated the C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> relationship between a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pollutant</ENAMEX> and a given health endpoint using a single function from
a single study or using multiple C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions from several
studies, each C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> relationship was applied uniformly throughout the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> to generate health benefit estimates. However, to the extent
that pollutant/health effect relationships are region-specific,
applying a location-specific C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> function at all locations in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> may result in overestimates of health effect changes in some
locations and underestimates of health effect changes in other
locations. It is not possible, however, to know the extent or
direction of the overall effect on health benefit estimates
introduced by application of a single C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> function to the entire
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> This may be a significant uncertainty in the analysis, but the
current state of the scientific literature does not allow for a
region-specific estimation of health benefits.
Uncertainties in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM Mortality Relationship</ENAMEX>
Health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have consistently linked air pollution,
especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>, with excess mortality. A substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of
published scientific literature recognizes a correlation between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevated PM</ENAMEX> concentrations and increased mortality rates. However,
there is much about this relationship that is still uncertain<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX>
These uncertainties include:
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">22 PM</TIMEX> is a mix of particles of varying size and chemical
properties. The composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> can vary considerably from one
region to another depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particulate</ENAMEX> emissions
in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>.
23The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> studies used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> benefits
analysis may also be subject to many of the uncertainties listed in
this section.

24 Much of this literature is summarized in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> PM Criteria
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Document</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996a</TIMEX>). There is much about this relationship
that is still uncertain. As stated in preamble to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> PM
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ambient Air Quality Standards</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 CFR</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 1997</TIMEX>), "the
consistency of the results of the epidemiological studies from a
large number of different locations and the coherent nature of the
observed effects are suggestive of a likely causal role of ambient

report on research priorities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAS</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>), indicates that
"there is a great deal of uncertainty about the implications of the
findings [of an association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> and premature mortality] for
risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, due to the limited scientific information about
the specific types of particles that might cause adverse health

human exposures, the toxicological mechanisms by which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> might cause adverse health effects, and other important
questions." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> acknowledges these uncertainties; however, for this
analysis, we assume a causal relationship between exposure to

(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-01-004</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>). Thus, recent evidence suggests
that by not including an estimate of reductions in short-term
mortality due to changes in ambient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> and

C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> function is uncertain, but this analysis assumes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
function to have a log-linear form (as derived from the literature)
throughout the relevant range of exposures. If this is not the
correct form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R function, or if certain scenarios predict
concentrations well above the range of values for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
function was fitted, avoided mortality may be misestimated.
C <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Regional Differences</ENAMEX>. As discussed above, significant
variability exists in the results of different PM/mortality
studies. This variability may reflect regionally specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
functions resulting from regional differences in factors such as
the physical and chemical composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX>. If true regional
differences exist, applying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PM/Mortality C-</ENAMEX>R function to
regions outside the study location could result in mis-estimation

C <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exposure/Mortality Lags</ENAMEX>. It is currently unknown whether there
is a time lag -- a delay between changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> exposures and
changes in mortality rates -- in the chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PM</ENAMEX>/mortality
relationship. The existence of such a lag is important for the
valuation of premature mortality incidence because economic theory
suggests that benefits occurring in the future should be
discounted. There is no specific scientific evidence of the
existence or structure of a PM effects lag. However, current
scientific literature on adverse health effects similar to those
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smoking-related disease</ENAMEX>) and the
difference in the effect size between chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX> studies and
daily mortality studies suggest that all incidences of premature
mortality reduction associated with a given incremental change in
PM exposure probably would not occur in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> as the
exposure reduction. The smoking-related literature also implies
that lags of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to a few years</TIMEX> are plausible. Adopting the lag

structure. This approach assumes that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> of PM-related

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uncertainties Associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental</ENAMEX> and Ecosystem
Effects Estimation
Our analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> includes a quantitative
estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> environmental effects: recreational visibility
and ozone effects on agriculture. Scientific studies, however, have
reliably linked atmospheric emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX>, nitrogen, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> to a much wider range of other environmental and ecological
effects. Some of these effects are acute in nature, and some are
longer-term and could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> to manifest. The effects
include the following:

These effects are left unquantified for a variety of reasons,
but mostly because of the complexity of modeling these effects and
the major uncertainties in reliably quantifying the incremental
effects of atmospheric emissions reductions on ecological
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Individually</ENAMEX>, many of these environmental effects may be
relatively small in terms of their overall ecosystem and monetary
importance, particularly in the near-term. Their cumulative and
longer term effects, however, some of which may be largely unknown
at this time, may be substantial. As a result, the omission of this
broad class of benefits from our quantitative results likely causes
our estimates to substantially understate the total benefits of the
Clear Skies Act.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uncertainties Associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Valuation of</ENAMEX>
Benefits
Economic valuation of benefits often involves estimation of the
willingness-to-pay of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to avoid harmful health or
environmental effects. In most cases, there are no markets in which
to directly observe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for these types of commodities. In some
cases, we can rely on indirect market transactions, such as the
implicit tradeoff of wages for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">on-the-job</ENAMEX> mortality risk among the
working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, to estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX>. In other cases, we must rely
on survey approaches to estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX>, usually through a variant of
the contingent valuation approach, which generally involves
directly questioning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> in hypothetical
market situations. Regardless of the method used to estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX>,
there are measurement errors, data inadequacies, and ongoing
debates about the best practices for each method that contribute to
the overall uncertainty of economic estimates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Benefits Transfer Considerations</ENAMEX>
For the Clear Skies benefits analysis, we do not have the time
or resources to conduct primary economic research targeted at the
specific air pollution-related benefits provided. As a result, we
rely on the transfer of benefits estimates from existing studies.
The conduct of "benefits transfer" exercises necessarily involves
some uncertainties. These uncertainties can be reduced by careful
consideration of the differences in the health risk or air
pollution commodity and the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in the underlying
economic literature versus the context of benefits conferred by the
Clear Skies Act. For example, we make adjustments to the mortality
valuation estimates to account for the estimated lag between
exposure and manifestation of the effect, reflecting the basic
economic tenet that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> prefer benefits that occur sooner
to those that occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>. We also make adjustments to account for
expected changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> over time as per capita income increases.
We cannot adjust for all benefits transfer considerations, however,
thus introducing additional uncertainty into our estimates.
Lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adequate Data</ENAMEX> or Methods
The lack of adequate data or methods to characterize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> results
in our inability to present monetized benefits of some categories
of effects. For example, while studies exist that estimate the
benefits of visibility improvements to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the places
they reside, these residential visibility studies are considered by
some in the resource economics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to be less reliable
because of the methods applied. In the case of residential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visibility</ENAMEX>, we conduct sensitivity analyses to estimate the impact
of this uncertainty in the reliability of methods. To the extent
effects such as these represent categories of benefits that are
truly valuable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, we have underestimated the
total benefits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Uncertainties Specific to Premature Mortality Valuation</ENAMEX>
The economic benefits associated with premature mortality are
the largest category of monetized benefits of the Clear Skies
Act<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX> In addition, in prior analyses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> has identified valuation
of mortality benefits as the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contributor</ENAMEX> to the range of
uncertainty in monetized
26As noted in the methods section, it is actually reductions in
mortality risk that are valued in a monetized benefit analysis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individual WTPs</ENAMEX> for small reductions in mortality risk are summed
over enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to infer the value of a statistical life
saved. This is different from the value of a particular, identified
life saved. The "value of a premature death avoided," then, should
be understood as shorthand for "the value of a statistical
premature death avoided."
benefits (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1999a</ENAMEX>). Because of the uncertainty in
estimates of the value of premature mortality avoidance, it is
important to adequately characterize and understand the various
types of economic approaches available for mortality valuation.
Such an assessment also requires an understanding of how
alternative valuation approaches reflect that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may
be more susceptible to air pollution-induced mortality, or reflect
differences in the nature of the risk presented by air pollution
relative to the risks studied in the relevant economic
literature.
The health science literature on air pollution indicates that
several human characteristics affect the degree to which mortality
risk affects an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. For example, some age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> appear to
be more susceptible to air pollution than others (e.g., the elderly
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>). Health status prior to exposure also affects
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX>. At risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> include those who have suffered
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> or are suffering from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowlatt, et</ENAMEX> al. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>). An ideal benefits estimate of mortality
risk reduction would reflect these human characteristics, in
addition to an individual's willingness to pay (WTP) to improve
one's own chances of survival plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to improve other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' survival rates.27 The ideal measure would also take
into account the specific nature of the risk reduction commodity
that is provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, as well as the context in which
risk is reduced. To measure this value, it is important to assess
how reductions in air pollution reduce the risk of dying from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> that reductions take effect onward, and how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> value
these changes. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s survival curve, or the probability
of surviving beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given age</TIMEX>, should shift as a result of an
environmental quality improvement. For example, changing the
current probability of survival for an individual also shifts
future probabilities of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s survival. This
probability shift will differ across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> because survival
curves are dependent on such characteristics as age, health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
and the current age to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> is likely to
survive.
Although a survival curve approach provides a theoretically
preferred method for valuing the benefits of reduced risk of
premature mortality associated with reducing air pollution, the
approach requires a great deal of data to implement. The economic
valuation literature does not yet include good estimates of the
value of this risk reduction commodity. As a result, in this study
we value avoided premature mortality risk using the value of
statistical life approach in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>, supplemented by
valuation based on an age-adjusted value of statistical life
estimate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>.
Other uncertainties specific to premature mortality valuation
include the following:
Across-study Variation: The analytical procedure used in the
main analysis to estimate the monetary benefits of avoided
premature mortality assumes that the appropriate economic value for
each incidence is a value from the currently accepted range of the
value of a statistical life. This estimate is based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> studies
of the value of mortal risks. There is considerable uncertainty as
to whether the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> studies on the value of a statistical life
provide adequate estimates of the value of a statistical life saved
by air pollution reduction. Although there is considerable
variation in the analytical designs and data used in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
underlying studies, the majority of the studies involve the value
of risks to a middle-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working population</ENAMEX>. Most of the studies
examine differences in wages of risky occupations, using a
wage-hedonic approach. Certain characteristics of both the
27 For a more detailed discussion of altruistic values related

50
population affected and the mortality risk facing that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> are believed to affect the average willingness to pay
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX>) to reduce the risk. The appropriateness of a distribution of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> estimates from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> studies for valuing the mortality-related
benefits of reductions in air pollution concentrations therefore
depends not only on the quality of the studies (i.e., how well they
measure what they are trying to measure), but also on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the
extent to which the risks being valued are similar, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the studies are similar to the
population affected by changes in pollution concentrations.
C Level of risk reduction. The transferability of estimates of
the value of a statistical life from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> studies to the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX> analysis rests on the assumption that, within a
reasonable range, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for reductions in mortality risk is linear in
risk reduction. For example, suppose a study estimates that the
average WTP for a reduction in mortality risk of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/100,000</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX>,
but that the actual mortality risk reduction resulting from a given
pollutant reduction is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/10,000</NUMEX>. If WTP for reductions in mortality
risk is linear in risk reduction, then a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50</NUMEX> for a reduction
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/100,000</NUMEX> implies a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500</NUMEX> for a risk reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/10,000</NUMEX>
(which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times the risk reduction valued in the study). Under
the assumption of linearity, the estimate of the value of a
statistical life does not depend on the particular amount of risk
reduction being valued. This assumption has been shown to be
reasonable provided the change in the risk being valued is within
the range of risks evaluated in the underlying studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowlatt et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">al. 1998</ENAMEX>).
C <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voluntariness</ENAMEX> of risks evaluated. Although there may be
several ways in which jobrelated mortality risks differ from air
pollution-related mortality risks, the most important difference
may be that job-related risks are incurred voluntarily, or
generally assumed to be, whereas air pollution-related risks are
incurred involuntarily. There is some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">evidence28</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will
pay more to reduce involuntarily incurred risks than risks incurred
voluntarily. If this is the case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> estimates based on wage-risk
studies may understate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to reduce involuntarily incurred air
pollution-related mortality risks.
C Sudden versus protracted death. A final important difference
related to the nature of the risk may be that some workplace
mortality risks tend to involve sudden, catastrophic events,
whereas air pollution-related risks tend to involve longer periods
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and suffering prior to death. Some evidence suggests
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid a risk of a protracted death involving prolonged
suffering and loss of dignity and personal control is greater than
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> to avoid a risk (of identical magnitude) of sudden death.
To the extent that the mortality risks addressed in this assessment
are associated with longer periods of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or greater pain and
suffering than are the risks addressed in the valuation literature,
the WTP measurements employed in the present analysis would reflect
a downward bias.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">373,000</NUMEX> fewer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> summarizes the mean monetized
health and visibility benefits due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. As that
exhibit shows, we estimate the monetized benefits of the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX> in the continental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$44 billion</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$43 billion</NUMEX> in health benefits and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> in

to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$96 billion</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$93 billion</NUMEX> in health benefits and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 billion</NUMEX>
in recreational visibility benefits.
The results of our regional benefits analysis indicate that the

realized in the easternmost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of

In addition to calculating the physical effects and monetary
impacts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, we also estimated the distribution
of particulate matter air quality improvements that will be
experienced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> illustrates the

they represent that will experience changes in ambient particulate
matter concentrations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX>. As indicated in the table,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> yields relatively modest air quality

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>
Exhibits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 16</TIMEX> present the results of the Alternative
calculations. Exhibit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> presents the mean estimate of avoided
health effects in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX> for each health endpoint included
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> analysis. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>, the number of
avoided cases of chronic bronchitis, hospital and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> visits, and
minor respiratory illnesses and symptoms is the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX>.
The Alternative projects that reductions in exposure to fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PM</ENAMEX> and
ozone due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> will result in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,800</NUMEX> avoided
premature deaths in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 7,200</NUMEX> avoided premature deaths
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. The omission of long-term impacts of particulate matter on
mortality accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40 percent</NUMEX> reduction in the
estimate of avoided premature mortality in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>
relative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX>.
Exhibit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> summarizes the mean monetized health and visibility
benefits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>, which will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.3 billion</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14.1 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> reduction in
mortality under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX> and the difference in
valuation of premature mortality and chronic bronchitis explain the
difference in benefits between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches. Even using the
more conservative Alternative Estimate benefit projections,
however, the benefits of Clear Skies still outweigh the costs of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.7 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.5 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. It is also important
to note that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alternative and Base Estimate</ENAMEX> are likely to
underestimate the benefits of this proposal because of the many
environmental and health effects that we were unable to quantify in
this analysis.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensitivity Analyses</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> is based on our current interpretation of the
scientific and economic literature; its judgments regarding the
best available data, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and modeling methodologies; and the
assumptions it considers most appropriate to adopt in the face of
important uncertainties. The majority of the analytical assumptions
used to develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> have been reviewed and approved
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Advisory Board</ENAMEX> (SAB). However, we recognize that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and modeling limitations as well as simplifying assumptions
can introduce significant uncertainty into the benefit results and
that reasonable alternative assumptions exist for some inputs to
the analysis, such as the mortality C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions.
To address these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>, we supplement our Base Estimate of
benefits with a series of sensitivity calculations that make use of
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of concentration-response and valuation data for key
benefits categories. These sensitivity calculations are conducted
only for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> and not for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternative Estimate</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> we applied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concentrationresponse</ENAMEX> (C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>)
functions to estimate premature mortality incidence. Although we
used the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krewski, et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) mean-based ("<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PM2.5</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>), All
Causes") model exclusively to derive our Base Estimate of avoided
premature mortality, this analysis also examined the sensitivity of
the benefit results to the selection of alternative C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> functions
for premature mortality. We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
functions for this sensitivity analysis: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an alternative
specification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pope/ACS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krewski, et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>)
that adjusted for spatial correlation in the dataset; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
original <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pope/ACS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krewski et al.</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Six</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Cities</ENAMEX>" estimate. Exhibits <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 16</TIMEX> present the results of these
sensitivity analyses for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010 and 2020</TIMEX>, respectively.
The first alternative C-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> function is based on the relative risk
of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.16</NUMEX> from the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fine Particles Alone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Adjustment Random</ENAMEX>
Effects" model reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 46</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX> report. Commentary
by an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review panel</ENAMEX> noted that "a major contribution of
the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reanalysis Project</ENAMEX> is the recognition that both pollutant
variables and mortality appear to be spatially correlated in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACS</ENAMEX> data set. If not identified and modeled correctly, spatial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> could cause substantial errors in both the regression
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX> and their standard errors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>)." This C-R
function is a reasonable specification to explore the impact of
adjustments for broad regional correlations. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> noted that the spatial adjustment methods "may have over
adjusted the estimated effect for regional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> such as fine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> and sulfate compared with the effect estimates for more
local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>." Thus, the estimates of
avoided incidences of premature mortality based on this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
function may underestimate the true effect. (Note that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R
function is based on the original air quality dataset used in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACS</ENAMEX> study, covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, and used the median PM2.5 levels
rather than mean PM2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> as the indicator of exposure.)
For comparison with earlier benefits analyses, such as the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 812 Prospective Analysis</ENAMEX>, we also include estimates of
avoided incidences of premature mortality based on the
58
original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACS/Pope et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>) analysis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second row</TIMEX> of
Exhibit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 16</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> row of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Exhibit 17</ENAMEX> shows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krewski</ENAMEX>,
et al. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Six Cities</ENAMEX>" estimate of mortality. The
Krewski-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Six Cities</ENAMEX> study used a smaller sample of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> than the study by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX>;
however, it features improved exposure estimates, a slightly
broader study population (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 25 and older</TIMEX>), and a
follow-up period nearly twice as long as that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> al. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAB</ENAMEX> has noted that "the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Six Cities</ENAMEX>] study had better
monitoring with less measurement error than did most other studies"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-99-012</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>).
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we use an alternative valuation procedure to estimate
the value of avoided premature mortality, with explicit
consideration of the expected age of mortality incidence associated
with air pollution exposure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age-specific VSL</ENAMEX> adjustment factors
can be derived from a series of contingent valuation studies
conducted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> to evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTP</ENAMEX> for road safety
improvements that reduce mortality risk. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> available <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>,
both authored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, derive significantly differing
adjustment factors, and reflect reflecting the overall uncertainty
within the literature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> age-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">VSL</ENAMEX> adjustments. The
results of this alternative calculation reduce the overall Base
Estimate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43 percent</NUMEX> for the more extreme
adjustment derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>), and by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 percent</NUMEX> for the
less extreme adjustment derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>), as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summarized in Exhibits</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 and 16 below</NUMEX>. The specific adjustment
procedure applied is described in more detail in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavy-Duty</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engine/Diesel Fuel RIA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. EPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>).
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, as noted in the section above on visibility valuation, we
chose not to include in our Base Estimate the valuation of
residential visibility or valuation of recreational visibility at
Class I areas outside of the study regions examined in the Chestnut
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1990a, 1990b</ENAMEX>) study. The last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exhibits</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> summarize the impact of applying the existing visibility
valuation literature more broadly than in our Base <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estimate</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones-Lee</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>) provides an estimate of age-adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VSL</ENAMEX> based on
a finding that older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> value mortality risk reductions only
somewhat less than middle-aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
61
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, we conducted a quantitative sensitivity test on one
aspect of the PM-mortality dose-response function. Although the
consistent advice from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Advisory Board</ENAMEX> has been to
model premature mortality associated with PM exposure as a
non-threshold effect, that is, with harmful effects to exposed
populations regardless of the absolute level of ambient PM
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have hypothesized the presence of a
threshold relationship. The nature of the hypothesized relationship
is that there might exist a PM concentration level below which
further reductions no longer yield premature mortality reduction
benefits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> does not necessarily endorse any particular
threshold. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nonetheless, Exhibit</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> illustrates how our estimates of
the number of premature mortalities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Base Estimate</ENAMEX> might
change under a range of alternative assumptions for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PM</ENAMEX> mortality
threshold. If, for example, there were no benefits of reducing PM
concentrations below the proposed PM2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> standard of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 µg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m3</ENAMEX>, our
estimate of the total number of premature mortalities in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> would
be reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80 percent</NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 12,000</NUMEX>
annually to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2,200</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important assumption that we adopted for the threshold
sensitivity analysis is that no adjustments are made to the shape
of the concentration-response function above the assumed threshold.
Instead, thresholds were applied by simply assuming that any
changes in ambient concentrations below the assumed threshold would
have no impacts on the incidence of premature mortality. If there
were actually a threshold, then the shape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>R function above
the threshold would likely change.
