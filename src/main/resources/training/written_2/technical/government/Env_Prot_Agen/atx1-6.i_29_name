<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>


1.1
This manual describes acute toxicity tests for use in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System</ENAMEX> (NPDES) Permits
Program to identify effluents and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> containing toxic
materials in acutely toxic concentrations. With the exception of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Holmesimysis costata Acute Test</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 19</ENAMEX>), the methods
included in this manual are referenced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table IA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFR</ENAMEX> Part 136
regulations and, therefore, constitute approved methods for acute
toxicity tests. They are also suitable for determining the toxicity
of specific compounds contained in discharges. The tests may be
conducted in a central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or on-site, by the regulatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> or the permittee. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Holmesimysis costata Acute Test</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>) is specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Coast</ENAMEX> waters and is not listed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> CFR
Part <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX> for nationwide use. This method has been proposed but not
yet approved at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFR</ENAMEX> Part 136.


1.2
The data are used for NPDES permits development and to
determine compliance with permit toxicity limits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> can also be
used to predict potential acute and chronic toxicity in the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LC50</TIMEX> and appropriate dilution,
application, and persistence factors. The tests are performed as a
part of self-monitoring permit requirements, compliance
biomonitoring inspections, toxics sampling inspections, and special
investigations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from acute toxicity tests performed as part of
permit requirements are evaluated during compliance evaluation
inspections and performance audit inspections.


1.3
Modifications of these tests are also used in toxicity
reduction evaluations and toxicity identification evaluations to
identify the toxic components of an effluent, to aid in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and implementation of toxicity reduction plans, and to
compare and control the effectiveness of various treatment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> for a given type of industry, irrespective of the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988b</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
1989b; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991a</TIMEX>).


1.4
This methods manual serves as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> to the
short-term chronic toxicity test methods manuals for freshwater and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marine organisms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002b</TIMEX>), the NPDES compliance
inspection manual (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988c</TIMEX>), and the manual for evaluation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> performing aquatic toxicity tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991b</TIMEX>). In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> revised previous editions of each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> methods
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manuals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994b</TIMEX>).


1.5
Guidance for the implementation of toxicity tests in the
NPDES program is provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Support Document</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Quality</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991c</TIMEX>).


1.6
The use of any test species or test conditions other than
those described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tables 12-18</ENAMEX> in this manual and referenced in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1A</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 CFR 136.3</NUMEX>, shall be considered a major modification to
the method and subject to application and approval of alternate
test procedures under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 CFR 136.4</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> CFR <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136.5</NUMEX>.


1.7
These methods are restricted to use by, or under the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision of</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> experience in the use or conduct of, and
interpretation of data from, aquatic toxicity tests. Each analyst
must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable test results
with the methods using the procedures described in this methods
manual.


1.8
This manual was prepared in the established
EMSL-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> format (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983a</TIMEX>).


2.1
The selection of the test type will depend on the NPDES
permit requirements, the objectives of the test, the available
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, the requirements of the test organisms, and effluent
characteristics such as fluctuations in effluent
toxicity.


2.2
Effluent acute toxicity is generally measured using a
multi-concentration, or definitive test, consisting of a control
and a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> effluent concentrations. The tests are
designed to provide dose-response information, expressed as the
percent effluent concentration that is lethal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LC50</NUMEX>) within the prescribed period of time (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-96</NUMEX> h), or
the highest effluent concentration in which survival is not
statistically significantly different from the control.


2.3
Use of pass/fail tests consisting of a single effluent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (e.g., the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> concentration or RWC) and
a control is not recommended. If the NPDES permit has a whole
effluent toxicity limit for acute toxicity at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, it is
prudent to use that permit limit as the midpoint of a series of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> effluent concentrations. This will ensure that there is
sufficient information on the dose-response relationship. For
example, the effluent concentrations utilized in a test may be: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> effluent, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/2</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/4</ENAMEX>. More specifically, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, appropriate effluent
concentrations may be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX>.


2.4
Receiving (ambient) water toxicity tests commonly employ
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatments, a control and the undiluted receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, but
may also consist of a series of receiving water
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilutions</ENAMEX>.


2.5
A negative result from an acute toxicity test does not
preclude the presence of chronic toxicity. Also, because of the
potential temporal variability in the toxicity of effluents, a
negative test result with a particular sample does not preclude the
possibility that samples collected at some other time might exhibit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acute</ENAMEX> (or chronic) toxicity.


2.6
The frequency with which acute toxicity tests are
conducted under a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES</ENAMEX> permit is determined by the
regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> on the basis of factors such as the variability
and degree of toxicity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX>, production schedules, and
process changes.


2.7
Tests may be static (static non-renewal or static
renewal), or flow-through.


2.7.1 STATIC TESTS


2.7.1.1
Static non-renewal tests - The test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are exposed
to the same test solution for the duration of the test.


2.7.1.2
Static-renewal tests - The test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are exposed to
a fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> of the same concentration of sample every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h or
other prescribed interval, either by transferring the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> to another, or by replacing all or
a portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> in the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>.


2.7.2
FLOW-THROUGH TESTS




2.7.2.1
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> types of flow-through tests are in common use: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
sample is pumped continuously from the sampling point directly to
the dilutor system; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) grab or composite samples are collected
periodically, placed in a tank adjacent to the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and
pumped continuously from the tank to the dilutor system. The
flow-through method employing continuous sampling is the preferred
method for on-site tests. Because of the large volume (often 400
L/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>) of effluent normally required for flow-through tests, it is
generally considered too costly and impractical to conduct these
tests off-site at a central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>.


2.8
Advantages and disadvantages of the types of tests are as
follows:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.8.1 STATIC NON-RENEWAL</ENAMEX> TESTS
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.8.1.1 Advantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Simple and inexpensive.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Very cost effective in determining compliance with permit
conditions.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited resources</ENAMEX> (space, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manpower</ENAMEX>, equipment) required;
would permit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to perform many more tests in the same amount of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Smaller volume of effluent required than for static
renewal or flow-through tests.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.8.1.2 Disadvantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dissolved oxygen</ENAMEX> (DO) depletion may result from high
chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), or
metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Possible loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adsorption</ENAMEX> to the exposure vessels.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Generally less sensitive than static renewal or
flow-through tests, because the toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> may degrade or be
adsorbed, thereby reducing the apparent toxicity. Also, there is
less chance of detecting slugs of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>, or other temporal
variations in waste <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.8.2 STATIC-RENEWAL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACUTE TOXICITY</ENAMEX> TESTS
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.8.2.1 Advantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Reduced possibility of dissolved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> (DO) depletion
from high chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> demand (COD) and/or biological oxygen
demand (BOD), or ill effects from metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> from organisms
in the test solutions.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Reduced possibility of loss of toxicants through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">volatilization</ENAMEX> and/or adsorption to the exposure
vessels.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Test organisms that rapidly deplete energy reserves are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> when the test solutions are renewed, and are maintained in a
healthier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.8.2.2 Disadvantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Require greater volume of effluent that non-renewal
tests.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Generally less sensitive than flow-through tests, because
the toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> may degrade or be adsorbed, thereby reducing
the apparent toxicity. Also, there is less chance of detecting
slugs of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>, or other temporal variations in waste
properties.


2.8.3 FLOW-THROUGH TESTS
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.8.3.1 Advantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Provide a more representative evaluation of the acute
toxicity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, especially if sample is pumped continuously
directly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and its toxicity varies with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
DO concentrations are more easily maintained in the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
A higher loading factor (biomass) may be used.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
The possibility of loss of toxicant due to
volatilization, adsorption, degradation, and uptake is
reduced.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.8.3.2 Disadvantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Large volumes of sample and dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are
required.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Test equipment is more complex and expensive, and
requires more maintenance and attention.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
More <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> is required to conduct tests.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Because of the resources required, it would be very
difficult to perform multiple or overlapping sequential
tests.


HEALTH AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAFETY</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</ENAMEX>


3.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> and maintenance of an effective health and
safety program in the laboratory requires an ongoing commitment by
laboratory management, and includes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the appointment of a
laboratory health and safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> with the responsibility and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> to develop and maintain a safety program, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
preparation of a formal, written, health and safety plan, which is
provided to each laboratory staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) an ongoing training
program on laboratory safety, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) regularly scheduled,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documented</ENAMEX>, safety inspections.


3.1.2
Collection and use of effluents in toxicity tests may
involve significant risks to personal safety and health. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personnel</ENAMEX>
collecting effluent samples and conducting toxicity tests should
take all safety precautions necessary for the prevention of bodily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> which might result from ingestion or invasion of
infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, inhalation or absorption of corrosive or toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> through skin contact, and asphyxiation due to lack of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> or presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noxious gases</ENAMEX>.


3.1.3
Prior to sample collection and laboratory work, personnel
must determine that all required safety equipment and materials
have been obtained and are in good condition.


3.1.4
Guidelines for the handling and disposal of hazardous
materials must be strictly followed.


3.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAFETY EQUIPMENT</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3.2.1 PERSONAL SAFETY GEAR</ENAMEX>


3.2.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Personnel</ENAMEX> must use safety equipment, as required, such as
rubber <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aprons</ENAMEX>, laboratory coats, respirators, gloves, safety
glasses, hard hats, and safety shoes.


3.2.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LABORATORY SAFETY EQUIPMENT</ENAMEX>




3.2.2.1
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> (including mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>) must be
provided with safety equipment such as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> aid kits, fire
extinguishers, fire blankets, emergency showers, and eye
fountains.


3.2.2.2
Mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> should be equipped with a telephone
to enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to summon help in case of emergency.


3.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENERAL LABORATORY AND FIELD OPERATIONS</ENAMEX>




3.3.1
Guidance in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Material Safety Data Sheets</ENAMEX> should be
followed for reagents and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> purchased from supply
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>. Incompatible materials should not be stored
together.


3.3.2
Work with effluents must be performed in compliance with
accepted rules pertaining to the handling of hazardous materials
(see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety Manuals</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 3.5</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Personnel</ENAMEX> collecting samples
and performing toxicity tests should not work alone.


3.3.3
Because the chemical composition of effluents is usually
only poorly known, they must be considered as potential health
hazards, and exposure to them should be minimized. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fume</ENAMEX> and canopy
hoods over the test areas must be used whenever
necessary.


3.3.4
It is advisable to cleanse exposed parts of the body
immediately after collecting effluent samples.


3.3.5
All containers must be adequately labeled to indicate
their contents.


3.3.6
Strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and volatile organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX> employed in
glassware cleaning must be used in a fume hood or under an exhaust
canopy over the work area.


3.3.7
Good housekeeping contributes to safety and reliable
results.


3.3.8
Electrical equipment or extension cords not bearing the
approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underwriter Laboratories</ENAMEX> must not be used. Ground-fault
interrupters must be installed in all "wet" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> where
electrical equipment is used.


3.3.9

to contain human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> should be immunized against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tetanus</ENAMEX>, typhoid fever, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">polio</ENAMEX>.


3.5
SAFETY MANUALS




3.5.1
For further guidance on safe practices when collecting
effluent samples and conducting toxicity tests, check with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permittee</ENAMEX> and consult general industrial safety manuals, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">USEPA (1986) and Walters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jameson</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>).


3.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASTE DISPOSAL</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3.6.1 Wastes</ENAMEX> generated during toxicity testing must be properly
handled and disposed of in an appropriate manner. Each testing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX> will have its own waste disposal requirements based on
local, state, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> rules and regulations. It is extremely
important that these rules and regulations be known, understood,
and complied with by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> responsible for, or otherwise
involved in, performing testing activities. Local fire officials
should be notified of any potentially hazardous conditions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUALITY ASSURANCE</ENAMEX>
4.1 INTRODUCTION
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4.1.1 Development</ENAMEX> and maintenance of a toxicity test laboratory
quality assurance (QA) program requires an ongoing commitment by
laboratory management, and includes the following: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) appointment
of a laboratory quality assurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> with the responsibility
and authority to develop and maintain a QA program;
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) preparation of a quality assurance plan with data quality
objectives; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) preparation of written descriptions of laboratory
standard operating procedures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOP's</ENAMEX>) for test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism culturing</ENAMEX>,
toxicity testing, instrument calibration, sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-of-custody,
laboratory sample tracking system, etc.; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) provision of
adequate, qualified technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and suitable space and
equipment to assure reliable data.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QA</ENAMEX> practices within an aquatic toxicology <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> must
address all activities that affect the quality of the final
effluent toxicity data, such as: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) effluent sampling and
handling; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and condition of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
condition and operation of equipment; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) test conditions; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
instrument calibration; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) replication;
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) use of reference toxicants; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>) record keeping; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) data
evaluation.


4.1.3
Quality control practices, on the other hand, consist of
the more focused, routine, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> activities carried out within
the scope of the overall QA program. For more detailed discussion

<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>.


4.2.2
Laboratory and toxicity test
temperature control equipment must be adequate to maintain
recommended test water temperatures. Recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> must be
used in the fabrication of the test equipment which comes in
contact with the effluent (see Section 5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equipment</ENAMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




4.3.1
The test organisms used in the procedures described in
this manual are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 6, Test Organisms</ENAMEX>. The organisms
should appear healthy, behave normally, feed well, and have low
mortality in cultures, during holding, and in test controls. Test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> should be positively identified to species.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LABORATORY WATER USED FOR</ENAMEX> CULTURING AND <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST DILUTION</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WATER</ENAMEX>


4.4.1 The quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used for test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism culturing</ENAMEX> and
for dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used in toxicity tests is extremely important.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uses should come from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX> used in effluent toxicity tests will depend in part
on the objectives of the study and logistical constraints, as
discussed in detail in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 7, Dilution Water</ENAMEX>. The dilution
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used for internal quality assurance tests with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>,
food, and reference toxicants should be the water routinely used
with success in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. Types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are discussed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities and Equipment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> used for culturing and
test dilution should be analyzed for toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> and organics at
least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.5 EFFLUENT</ENAMEX> SAMPLING AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAMPLE HANDLING</ENAMEX>


4.5.1
Sample holding times and temperatures must conform to
conditions described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 8, Effluent and Receiving Water</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sampling</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sample Handling</ENAMEX>.


4.6
TEST CONDITIONS




4.6.1
The temperature of test solutions
must be measured by placing the thermometer or probe directly into
the test solutions, or by placing the thermometer in equivalent
volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in surrogate vessels positioned at appropriate
locations among the test vessels. Temperature should be recorded
continuously in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> during the duration of each
test. Test solution temperatures should be maintained within the
limits specified for each test. DO concentration and pH in test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX> should be checked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> throughout the test period, as
prescribed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 9, Acute Toxicity Test Procedures</ENAMEX>.


4.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QUALITY OF TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




4.7.1
The health of test organisms is primarily assessed by the
performance (survival, growth, and/or reproduction) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> treatments of individual tests. The health and sensitivity
of test organisms is also assessed by reference toxicant testing.
In addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, reference toxicant testing is used to initially
demonstrate acceptable laboratory performance (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.14</NUMEX>) and
to document ongoing laboratory performance (Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.15</NUMEX>).


4.7.2
Regardless of the source of test organisms (in-house
cultures or purchased from external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>), the testing
laboratory must perform at least one acceptable reference toxicant
test per month for each toxicity test method conducted in that
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.15</NUMEX>). If a test method is conducted only
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>, or less frequently, a reference toxicant test must be
performed concurrently with each effluent toxicity test.


4.7.3
When acute or short-term chronic toxicity tests are
performed with effluents or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> using test organisms
obtained from outside the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, concurrent toxicity
tests of the same type must be preformed with a reference toxicant,
unless the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> provides control chart data from
at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five monthly</TIMEX> acute toxicity tests using the same
reference toxicant and test conditions.


4.7.4
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> should also certify the species
identification of the test organisms, and provide the taxonomic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reference</ENAMEX> (citation and page) or name(s) of the taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>(s)
consulted.


4.7.5
If a routine reference toxicant test fails to meet test
acceptability criteria, then the reference toxicant test must be
immediately repeated.


4.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOOD QUALITY</ENAMEX>




4.8.1
The nutritional quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> used in culturing and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">testing fish</ENAMEX> and invertebrates is an important factor in the
quality of the toxicity test data. This is especially true for the
unsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> content of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine shrimp nauplii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Artemia</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Suitable trout chow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Artemia</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> must be obtained as
described in this manual.


4.8.2
Problems with the nutritional suitability of the food
will be reflected in the survival, growth, and reproduction of the
test organisms in cultures and toxicity tests. If a batch of food
is suspected to be defective, the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> fed with
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> can be compared with the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> fed
with a food of known quality in side-by-side tests. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is
used for culturing, its suitability should be determined using a
short-term chronic test which will determine the effect of food
quality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in culture, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> replicates with each food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
Where applicable, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> used only in acute toxicity tests can be
compared with a food of known quality in side-by-side,
multi-concentration acute tests, using the reference toxicant
regularly employed in the laboratory QA program.


4.8.3
New batches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> used in culturing and testing should
be analyzed for toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> or whenever difficulty is
encountered in meeting minimum test acceptability criteria for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> survival and reproduction or growth. If the concentration
of total organochlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> exceeds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">0.l5 µg/g</ENAMEX> wet weight, or
the concentration of the total organochlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX>
exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX> µg/g wet weight, or toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX>, As, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cr, Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cu</ENAMEX>,
Pb, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>, expressed as total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>) exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX> µg/g wet weight,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> should not be used (for analytical methods see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOAC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USDA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> (e.g., such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YCT</ENAMEX>) which are used to
culture and test organisms, the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> should meet the
requirements for the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used for culturing and test
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX> as described in Section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX> above.


4.9
ACCEPTABILITY OF <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACUTE TOXICITY TEST RESULTS</ENAMEX>




4.9.1
For the test results to be acceptable, control survival
must equal or exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>.


4.9.2
An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> test may be conditionally acceptable if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, DO, and other specified conditions fall outside
specifications, depending on the degree of the departure and the
objectives of the tests (see test condition summaries). The
acceptability of the test will depend on the experience and
professional judgment of the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> and the reviewing
staff of the regulatory authority. Any deviation from test
specifications must be noted when reporting data from a
test.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4.10 ANALYTICAL METHODS</ENAMEX>


4.10.1
Routine chemical and physical analyses for culture and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and test solutions, must include established
quality assurance practices outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> methods manuals
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993b</TIMEX>).


4.10.2
Reagent containers should be dated when received from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supplier</ENAMEX>, and the shelf life should not be exceeded. Also, working
solutions should be dated when prepared, and the recommended shelf
life should be observed.


4.11
CALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATION




4.11.1
Instruments used for routine measurements of chemical and
physical parameters such as pH, DO, temperature, conductivity,
salinity, alkalinity, and hardness must be calibrated and
standardized prior to use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> according to the instrument
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s procedures as indicated in the general section on
quality assurance (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Methods 150.1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170.1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120.1</NUMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979b</TIMEX>). Calibration data are recorded in a permanent
log.


4.11.2
Wet chemical methods used to measure hardness,
alkalinity, and total residual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> must be standardized prior
to use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> according to the procedures for those specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
methods (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Methods 130.2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">310.1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1979b</ENAMEX>).


4.12
REPLICATION AND <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST SENSITIVITY</ENAMEX>




4.12.1
The sensitivity of toxicity tests
will depend in part on the number of replicates per concentration,
the significance level selected, and the type of statistical
analysis. If the variability remains constant, the sensitivity of
the test will increase as the number of replicates is increased.
The minimum recommended number of replicates varies with the
objectives of the test and the statistical method used for analysis
of the data.


4.13
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VARIABILITY</ENAMEX> IN <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOXICITY TEST RESULTS</ENAMEX>




4.13.1
Factors which can affect test success and precision
include: the experience and skill of the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>; test
organism age, condition, and sensitivity; dilution water quality;
temperature control; and the quality and quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> provided.
The results will depend upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> used and the strain or
source of the test organisms, and test conditions such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, DO, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and water quality. The repeatability or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of toxicity tests is also a function of the number of
test organisms used at each toxicant concentration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jensen</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>)
discussed the relationship between sample size (numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>)
and the standard error of the test, and considered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> per
concentration as optimum for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis.</ENAMEX>


4.13.2
Test precision can be estimated by using the same strain
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> under the same test conditions, and employing a known
toxicant, such as a reference toxicant. The single-laboratory
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">intra-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>) and multi-laboratory (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of acute toxicity tests with several common test species
and reference toxicants are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1-4</ENAMEX>. Intra- and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-laboratory precision are described by the mean, standard
deviation, and relative standard deviation (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> coefficient of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, or CV) of the calculated endpoints from the replicated
tests.


4.13.3
Intra-laboratory precision data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">268</NUMEX> acute toxicity
tests with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> reference toxicants are listed in
Tables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>. The precision, expressed as CV<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>, ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>. More recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> values reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jop et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorn</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogers</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowgill et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>), fell
in a somewhat lower range (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8% to 41%</NUMEX>).


4.13.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-laboratory precision of acute toxicity tests from
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253</NUMEX> reference toxicant tests with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, listed in Tables
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4, and 5</ENAMEX> (expressed as CV<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50s</TIMEX>), ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">167%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX> shows interlaboratory precision data from a study of
acute toxicity test methods using reference toxicant, effluent, and
receiving water sample types (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001b</TIMEX>). Averaged
across sample types, total interlaboratory precision (expressed as
CV<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50s</TIMEX>) ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13% to 38.5%</NUMEX> for the acute
methods.


4.13.5
No clear pattern of differences were noted in the intra-
or inter-laboratory test precision with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> listed,
although the test results with some toxicants, such as cadmium,
appear to more variable than those with other reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicants</ENAMEX>.


4.13.6
Additional information on toxicity test precision is
provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Support Document for Water Quality</ENAMEX>-Based

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.14 DEMONSTRATING ACCEPTABLE LABORATORY</ENAMEX>
PERFORMANCE


4.14.1
It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s responsibility to demonstrate its
ability to obtain consistent, precise results with reference
toxicants before it performs toxicity tests with effluents for
permit compliance purposes. To meet this requirement, the
intra-laboratory precision, expressed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> coefficient of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> (CV<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>), of each type of test to be used in a laboratory
should be determined by performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more tests with
different batches of test organisms, using the same reference
toxicant, at the same concentrations, with the same test conditions
(i.e., the same test duration, type of dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, age of test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, feeding, etc.), and same data analysis methods. A
reference toxicant concentration series (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX> or higher) should be
selected that will consistently provide partial mortalities at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
or more concentrations.


4.15
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOCUMENTING ONGOING LABORATORY PERFORMANCE</ENAMEX>




4.15.1
Satisfactory laboratory performance is demonstrated by
performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> acceptable test per month with a reference
toxicant for each toxicity test method conducted in the laboratory
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that month</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> test method, successive tests must
be performed with the same reference toxicant, at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, in the same dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, using the same data
analysis methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precision</ENAMEX> may vary with the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
reference toxicant, and type of test. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s reference
toxicity data will reflect conditions unique to that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>,
including dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, culturing, and other variables; however,
each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s reference toxicity results should reflect good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repeatability</ENAMEX>.


4.15.2
A control chart should be prepared for each combination
of reference toxicant, test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, test condition, and endpoint.
Toxicity endpoints from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six</NUMEX> tests are adequate for
establishing the control charts. In this technique, a running plot
is maintained for the toxicity values (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xi</ENAMEX>) from successive tests
with a given reference toxicant (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and endpoints (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LC50s</NUMEX>)
are examined to determine if they are within prescribed limits. The
types of control charts illustrated (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979a</TIMEX>) are used to
evaluate the cumulative trend of results from a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>,
thus reference toxicant test results should not be used as a de
facto criterion for rejection of individual effluent or receiving
water tests. The mean ( <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¯</NUMEX> ) and upper and lower control limits
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(±</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2S</ENAMEX>) are re-


X calculated with each successive test result. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
of data collection, or a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> data points, the control
chart should be maintained using only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most recent data
points.


4.15.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX> should compare the calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> (i.e.,
standard deviation / mean) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LC50</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most recent data
points to the distribution of laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported nationally
for reference toxicant testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3-3</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculated CV</ENAMEX> exceeds the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">75th</NUMEX> percentile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported
nationally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> should use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 75th and 90th</TIMEX> percentiles
to calculate warning and control limits, respectively, and the
laboratory should investigate options for reducing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>.


4.15.4
The outliers, which are values falling outside the upper
and lower control limits, and trends of increasing or decreasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, are readily identified. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P0.05</ENAMEX> probability
level, one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> tests would be expected to fall outside of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> limits by chance alone. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
reference toxicant tests fall outside the control limits, the
laboratory should investigate sources of variability, take
corrective actions to reduce identified sources of variability, and
perform an additional reference toxicant test during the same
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>. In those instances when the laboratory can document the
cause for the outlier (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> error, culture health or test
system failure), the outlier should be excluded from the future
calculations of the control limits. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> consecutive
tests do not fall within the control limits, the results must be
explained and the reference toxicant test must be immediately
repeated. Actions taken to correct the problem must be
reported.


4.15.5
If the toxicity value from a given test with the
reference toxicant falls well outside the expected range for the
test organisms when using the standard dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the
laboratory should investigate sources of variability, take
corrective actions to reduce identified sources of variability, and
perform an additional reference toxicant test during the same
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>. Performance should improve with experience, and the control
limits for point estimates should gradually narrow. However,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> limits of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">±2S</TIMEX>, by definition, will be exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, regardless of how well a laboratory performs. Highly
proficient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> which develop a very narrow control limit
may be unfairly penalized if a test which falls just outside the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> limits is rejected de facto. For this reason, the
width


of the control limits should be considered in determining
whether or not a reference toxicant test result falls "well"
outside the expected range. The width of the control limits may be
evaluated by comparing the calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> (i.e., standard deviation
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/ mean</ENAMEX>) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LC50</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most recent data points to the
distribution of laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported nationally for reference
toxicant testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3-3</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). In determining
whether or not a reference toxicant test result falls "well"
outside the expected range, the result also may be compared with
upper and lower bounds for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">±3S</TIMEX>, as any result outside these control
limits would be expected to occur by chance only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> tests
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment Canada</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>). When a result from a reference toxicant
test is outside the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence intervals, the laboratory must
conduct an immediate investigation to assess the possible causes
for the outlier.


4.15.6
Reference toxicant test results should not be used as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX> facto criterion for rejection of individual effluent or
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> tests. Reference toxicant testing is used for
evaluating the health and sensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> over time and
for documenting initial and ongoing laboratory performance. While
reference toxicant test results should not be used as a de facto
criterion for test rejection, effluent and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> test
results should be reviewed and interpreted in the light of
reference toxicant test results. The reviewer should consider the
degree to which the reference toxicant test result fell outside of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> chart limits, the width of the limits, the direction of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (toward increased test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism sensitivity</ENAMEX> or toward
decreased test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism sensitivity</ENAMEX>), the test conditions of both
the effluent test and the reference toxicant test, and the
objective of the test.


4.16
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REFERENCE TOXICANTS</ENAMEX>





4.16.1
Reference toxicants such as sodium
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chloride</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potassium chloride</ENAMEX> (KCl), cadmium chloride
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CdCl2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> sulfate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CuSO4</NUMEX>), sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecyl sulfate</ENAMEX> (SDS), and
potassium dichromate (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K2Cr2O7</NUMEX>), are suitable for use in the NPDES
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> programs requiring aquatic toxicity tests.
EMSL-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> hopes to release EPAcertified solutions of cadmium
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>, with accompanying toxicity data for the recommended
test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, for use as reference toxicants through cooperative
research and development agreements with commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, and
will continue to develop additional reference toxicants for future
release. Standard reference materials can be obtained from
commercial supply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, or can be prepared inhouse using reagent
grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>. The regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should be consulted before
reference toxicant(s) are selected and used.


4.17
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECORD KEEPING</ENAMEX>




4.17.1
Proper record keeping is important. A complete file
should be maintained for each individual toxicity test or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
tests on closely related samples. This file should contain a record
of the sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-of-custody; a copy of the sample log sheet; the
original bench sheets for the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> responses during the
toxicity test(s); chemical analysis data on the sample(s); detailed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> of the test organisms used in the test(s), such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
source, age, date of receipt, and other pertinent information
relating to their history and health; information on the
calibration of equipment and instruments; test conditions employed;
and results of reference toxicant tests. Laboratory data should be
recorded on a real-time basis to prevent the loss of information or
inadvertent introduction of errors into the record. Original data
sheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory personnel
performing the tests.


4.17.2
The regulatory authority should retain records pertaining
to discharge permits. Permittees are required to retain records
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertaining</ENAMEX> to permit applications and compliance for a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 CFR 122.41</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)].

toxicity test solutions with toxic fumes. Laboratory ventilation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> should be checked to ensure that return air from chemistry
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> and/or sample handling areas is not circulated to test
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">organism</ENAMEX> culture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> or toxicity test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, or that air from
toxicity test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> does not contaminate culture areas. Air
pressure differentials between such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> should not result in a
net flow of potentially contaminated air to sensitive areas through
open or loosely-fitting doors.


5.1.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> of test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> temperature can best be achieved
using circulating water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, heat exchangers, or environmental
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photoperiod</ENAMEX> can be controlled using automatic timers in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>.


5.1.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> used for rearing, holding, and testing organisms
may be reconstituted synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, ground <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
or dechlorinated tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dechlorination</ENAMEX> can be accomplished by
carbon filtration, laboratory water conditioning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, or the use
of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX>. After dechlorination, total residual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chlorine</ENAMEX> should be non-detectable. Sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX> may be toxic
to the test organisms, and if used for dechlorination, paired
controls with and without sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX> should be incorporated
in effluent toxicity tests. Use of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.6 mg</NUMEX> (anhydrous) sodium
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiosulfate/L</ENAMEX> will reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">l.0 mg chlorine</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L. After dechlorination</ENAMEX>,
total residual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> should be non-detectable.




5.1.4.1
A good quality, laboratory grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deionized water</ENAMEX>,
providing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 megaohm-cm</NUMEX>, must be available in the
laboratory and in sufficient quantity for laboratory needs.
Deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> may be obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MILLIPORE®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milli-Q®</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MILLIPORE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QPAKTM2</ENAMEX> or equivalent system. If large quantities of high
quality deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are needed, it may be advisable to supply
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> deionizer with preconditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CULLIGAN®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONTINENTAL®</ENAMEX>, or equivalent, mixed-bed water treatment
system.


5.1.5
Air used for aeration must be free of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and fumes.
Oil-free air pumps should be used where possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Particulates</ENAMEX> can
be removed from the air using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALSTON® Grade BX</ENAMEX> or equivalent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balston, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>), and oil and other organic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vapors</ENAMEX> can be removed using activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> filters (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALSTON®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-1</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX>, or equivalent).


5.1.6
During rearing, holding, and testing, test organisms
should be shielded from external disturbances such as rapidly
changing light conditions (especially salmonids) and pedestrian
traffic.


5.1.7
Materials used for exposure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>, tubing, etc., that
come in contact with the effluent and dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> should be
carefully chosen. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tempered glass</ENAMEX> and perfluorocarbon plastics
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEFLON®</ENAMEX>) should be used whenever possible to minimize sorption and
leaching of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, and may be reused after cleaning.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Containers</ENAMEX> made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypropylene</ENAMEX>,
polyvinyl chloride, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TYGON®</ENAMEX>, etc., may be used to ship, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, and
transfer effluents and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, but they should not be
reused unless absolutely necessary, because they could carry over
adsorbed toxicants from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test to another. However, these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX> may be repeatedly reused for storing uncontaminated
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> such as deionized or laboratory-prepared dilution waters and
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. Glass or disposable polystyrene containers can be
used as test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. The use of large (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L</ENAMEX>) glass carboys is
discouraged for safety reasons.


5.1.8
New plastic products should be tested for toxicity before
general use by exposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> to them under ordinary test
conditions.


5.1.9
Equipment which cannot be discarded after each use
because of cost, must be decontaminated according to the cleaning
procedures listed below. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiberglass</ENAMEX>, in addition to the previously
mentioned materials, can be used for holding and dilution water
storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, and in the water delivery system. All material
should be flushed or rinsed thoroughly with dilution water before
using in the test.




5.1.10
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX>, galvanized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>, brass, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lead</ENAMEX> must
not come in contact with holding or dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, or with
effluent samples and test solutions. Some materials, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neoprene rubber</ENAMEX> (commonly used for stoppers), may be toxic and
should be tested before use.


5.1.11
Silicone adhesive used to construct glass test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>
absorbs some organochlorine and organophosphorus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>, which
are difficult to remove. Therefore, as little of the adhesive as
possible should be in contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Extra beads of adhesive
inside the containers should be removed.

Additional species may be suitable for toxicity tests in
the NPDES Program. A list of alternative acute toxicity test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and minimal testing requirements (i.e., temperature,
salinity, and life stage) for these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are provided in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix B. Table</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> provides a summary of test conditions for
Holmesimysis costata, which should also be considered an
alternative acute toxicity test species. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holmesimysis</ENAMEX> costata
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acute Test</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 19</ENAMEX>) is specific to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Coast</ENAMEX> waters and is
not listed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFR</ENAMEX> Part <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX> for nationwide use. It is important
to note that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> may not be as easily cultured or tested
as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> on the list in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.2</NUMEX>, and may not be available from
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.


6.1.5
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have developed culturing and testing methods
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">indigenous species</ENAMEX> that may be as sensitive or more sensitive
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> recommended in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.2</NUMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> allows the use
of indigenous species only where state regulations require their
use or prohibit importation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.2</NUMEX>. Where state
regulations prohibit importation or use of the recommended test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, permission must be requested from the appropriate state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> prior to their use.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> The genus name of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> was formally changed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americamysis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>); however, the method manual will
continue to refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysidopsis</ENAMEX> bahia to maintain consistency with
previous versions of the method.


6.1.6
Where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have developed culturing and testing methods
for indigenous species other than those recommended in this manual,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> comparing the sensitivity of the substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and one or
more of the recommended species must be obtained in side-by-side
toxicity tests with reference toxicants and/or effluents, to ensure
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> selected are at least as sensitive as the
recommended species. These data must be submitted to the permitting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Region</ENAMEX>) if required. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> acknowledges that
reference toxicants prepared from pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> may not always be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of effluents. However, because of the observed
and/or potential variability in the quality and toxicity of
effluents, it is not possible to specify a representative
effluent.



6.1.7
Guidance for the selection of test organisms where the
salinity of the effluent and/or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> requires special
consideration is provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Support Document</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Quality</ENAMEX>-Based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991c</TIMEX>).

Where the salinity of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><1</NUMEX>,
freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are used regardless of the salinity of the
effluent.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Where the salinity of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX>, the
choice of organisms depends on state water quality standards and/or

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.2.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INHOUSE CULTURES</ENAMEX>


6.2.1.1
Inhouse cultures should be established wherever it is
cost effective. If inhouse cultures cannot be maintained, test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> should be purchased from experienced commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>
(see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>).


6.2.2
COMMERCIAL SUPPLIERS




6.2.2.1
All of the principal test organisms listed in Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.2</NUMEX> are available from commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERAL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NATURAL OCCURRING, WILD CAUGHT</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>


6.2.3.1 The use of test organisms taken from the receiving water
has strong appeal, and would seem to be the logical approach.
However, it is impractical for the following reasons:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sensitive organisms</ENAMEX> may not be present in the receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> because of previous exposure to the effluent or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
It is often difficult to collect organisms of the
required age and quality from the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>;


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> require collection permits, which may be
difficult to obtain. Therefore, it is usually more cost effective
to culture the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or obtain them from
private, state, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Fish such as fathead minnows,
sheepshead minnows, and silversides, and invertebrates such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daphnids</ENAMEX> and mysids, are easily reared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or
purchased.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
The required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QA/QC</ENAMEX> records, such as the single laboratory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> data, would not be available.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
Since it is mandatory that the identity of test organisms
is known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> level, it would necessary to examine each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organism</ENAMEX> caught in the wild to confirm its identity, which would
usually be impractical or, at the least, very stressful to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
Test organisms obtained from the wild must be observed in
the laboratory for a minimum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> prior to use, to assure
that they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial infections
and other adverse effects. Fish captured by electroshocking must
not be used in toxicity testing.




6.2.3.2
Guidelines for collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feral organisms</ENAMEX> are provided
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1990a</ENAMEX>.


6.2.4
Regardless of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, test organisms should be
carefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stress
and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and in good physical condition. Some species of test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>, can be obtained from stocks certified as
"disease-free."


6.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFE STAGE</ENAMEX>




6.3.1
Young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are often more sensitive to toxicants
than are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. For this reason, the use of early life stages,
such as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> instars of daphnids and juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mysids</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, is
required for all tests. In a given test, all organisms should be
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same age and should be taken from the same
source. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> may affect the results of the tests, it would
enhance the value and comparability of the data if the same species
in the same life stages were used throughout a monitoring program
at a given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.


6.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LABORATORY CULTURING</ENAMEX>




6.4.1
Instructions for culturing and/or holding the recommended
test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix A.</ENAMEX>


6.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HOLDING AND HANDLING TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




6.5.1
Test organisms should not be subjected to changes of more
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3EC</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> temperature or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3‰</NUMEX> in salinity in any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> h
period.


6.5.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organisms</ENAMEX> should be handled as little as possible. When
handling is necessary, it should be done as gently, carefully, and
quickly as possible to minimize stress. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> that are dropped
or touch dry surfaces or are injured during handling must be
discarded. Dipnets are best for handling larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nets</ENAMEX> are commercially available or can be made from small-mesh
nylon netting, silk bolting cloth, plankton netting, or similar
material. Wide-bore, smooth glass tubes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 8</NUMEX> mm inside diameter)
with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> or pipettors (such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROPIPETTE®</ENAMEX> or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pipettor</ENAMEX>) should be used for transferring smaller organisms such as
daphnids, mysids, and larval <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.


6.5.3
Holding tanks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are supplied with a good quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (see Section 5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities and Equipment</ENAMEX>) with a flow-through
rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tank</ENAMEX>-volumes per day. Otherwise, use a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recirculation</ENAMEX> system where the water flows through an activated
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> or undergravel filter to remove dissolved metabolites.
Culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can also be piped through high intensity ultraviolet
light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for disinfection, and to photodegrade dissolved
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organics</ENAMEX>.


6.5.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crowding</ENAMEX> should be avoided. The DO must be maintained at
a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.0 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> for marine and warm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, freshwater
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.0 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> for cold<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">freshwater species</ENAMEX>. The
solubility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> depends on temperature, salinity, and
altitude. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerate</ENAMEX> if necessary.


6.5.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> should be fed as much as they will eat at least once
a day with live or frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine shrimp</ENAMEX> or dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> (frozen food
should be completely thawed before use). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Brine shrimp</ENAMEX> can be
supplemented with commercially prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tetramin®</ENAMEX> or
BioRil® <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flake food</ENAMEX>, or equivalent. Excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and fecal material
should be removed from the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> at least twice a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> by siphoning.


6.5.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> should be observed carefully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> for signs of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, physical damage, and mortality. Dead and abnormal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX> should be removed as soon as observed. It is not uncommon
to have some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) mortality during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 48 h</TIMEX> in a
holding tank because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that refuse to feed on
artificial food and die of starvation.


6.5.7
A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> record of feeding, behavioral observations, and
mortality should be maintained.


6.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRANSPORTATION</ENAMEX> TO THE <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST SITE</ENAMEX>




6.6.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> are transported from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> or supply
laboratory to a remote test site in culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX> in plastic bags or large-mouth screw-cap (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 mL</NUMEX>)
plastic bottles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">styrofoam coolers</ENAMEX>. Adequate DO is maintained by
replacing the air above the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the bags with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> from a
compressed gas cylinder, and sealing the bags. Another method
commonly used to maintain sufficient DO during shipment is to
aerate with an airstone which is supplied from a portable pump. The
DO concentration must not fall below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> mg<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> for marine and
warm-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">freshwater species</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.0 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> for cold<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-water</ENAMEX>,
freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.


6.6.2
Upon arrival at the test site, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are transferred
to receiving water if receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is to be used as the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>. All but a small volume of the holding water
(<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX>) is removed by siphoning, and replaced slowly
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 10 to 15 min period</TIMEX> with dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. If receiving water
is used as dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, caution must be exercised in exposing
the test organisms to it, because of the possibility that it might
be toxic. For this reason, it is recommended that only
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> of the test organisms be exposed initially to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>. If this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> does not show excessive mortality or
obvious signs of stress in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>, the remainder of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are transferred to the dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


6.6.3
A group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> must not be used for a test if they
appear to be unhealthy, discolored, or otherwise stressed, or if
mortality appears to exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> preceding the test. If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> fail to meet these criteria, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> must be
discarded and a new group obtained. The mortality may be due to the
presence of toxicity, if receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is used as dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
rather than a diseased condition of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. If the
acclimation process is repeated with a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of test organisms
and excessive mortality occurs, it is recommended that an
alternative source of dilution water be used.


6.6.4
In static tests, marine organisms can be used at all
concentrations of effluent by adjusting the salinity of the
effluent to a standard salinity (such as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25‰</NUMEX>) or to the salinity
approximating that of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, by adding sufficient dry
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ocean</ENAMEX> salts, such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Forty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fathoms®</ENAMEX>, or equivalent, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GP2</TIMEX> or
hypersaline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX>.


6.6.5
Saline dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can be prepared with deionized
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or a freshwater such as well <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or a suitable surface
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. If dry ocean salts are used, care must be taken to ensure
that the added salts are completely dissolved and the solution is
aerated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> before the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are placed in the solutions.
The test organisms should be acclimated in synthetic saline water
prepared with the dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salts</ENAMEX>. Caution: addition of dry ocean salts
to dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> may result in an increase in pH. (The pH of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estuarine</ENAMEX> and coastal saline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> is normally
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>.)


6.6.6
All effluent concentrations and the control(s) used in a
test should have the same salinity. However, if this is impractical
because of the large volumes of water required, such as in
flow-through tests, the highest effluent concentration (lowest
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salinity</ENAMEX>) that could be tested would depend upon the salinity of
the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and the tolerance of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The
required salinities for toxicity tests with estuarine and marine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tables 16-19</ENAMEX>. However, the tolerances of
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> test species would have to be determined by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> in advance of the test.


6.6.7
Because of the circumstances described above, when
performing flow-through tests of effluents discharged to saline
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">waters</ENAMEX>, it is advisable to acclimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of test organisms to
each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different salinities, such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 20</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30‰</NUMEX>, prior
to transporting them to the test site. It may also be advisable to
maintain cultures of these test organisms at a series of salinity
levels, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30‰</NUMEX>, so that the change in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salinity</ENAMEX> upon acclimation at the desired test dilutions does not
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exceed 6‰.</ENAMEX>


6.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ORGANISM DISPOSAL</ENAMEX>


6.7.1 When the toxicity test is concluded, all test organisms
(including controls) should be humanely destroyed and disposed of
in an appropriate manner.
