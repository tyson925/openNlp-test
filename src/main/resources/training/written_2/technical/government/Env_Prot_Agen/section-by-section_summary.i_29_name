<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE CLEAR SKIES ACT OF</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act of 2002 extends and reorganizes Title IV</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> to establish new cap-and-trade programs requiring
reductions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, and mercury
emissions from electric generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. The Clear Skies Act
retains existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title IV</ENAMEX> requirements until the new requirements
take effect. Further, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> amends certain provisions
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title I of the Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> that currently apply to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">combustion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> covered by the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title IV</ENAMEX> emission caps.


<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title IV of the Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>
As revised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Title IV</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Parts</ENAMEX>. Part
A contains provisions common to the control of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>. Part B contains provisions specifically for sulfur
dioxide emission reductions. Part C contains provisions
specifically for nitrogen oxides emission reductions. Part D
contains provisions specifically for mercury emission reductions.
Part E contains performance standards for affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and
provisions for research, environmental monitoring, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>.
Part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. General Provisions</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 401</ENAMEX>. Reserved.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 402</ENAMEX>. Definitions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 402</ENAMEX> is based on the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 402</ENAMEX>, modified to
include new terms used in Parts A through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and to move to Subpart
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of Part B the defined terms that are unique to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acid Rain</ENAMEX>
Program.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 403</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allowance System</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX> is the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX>, modified to apply to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances, and mercury
allowances under the new trading programs essentially the same
allowance system provisions that apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances
under the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program. Certain provisions unique to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program are moved to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subpart 1</NUMEX> of Part <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Further</ENAMEX>,
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program and the new trading programs, the
existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX> is revised to provide that only the signature
of the party transferring allowances (not the signatures of both
parties to the transfer) is necessary for the transfer to be
effective. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> has already issued regulations under
the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide allowances</ENAMEX> and must
issue regulations within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 months</TIMEX> of enactment governing the
issuance, transfer, recording, and tracking of the nitrogen oxides
allowances and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury allowances</ENAMEX>. The allocations of these three
types of allowances, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the data used in
making the allocations, will not be subject to judicial review.
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> allowances are limited authorizations to emit and are not
property rights. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Owners</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> must
hold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> allowances at least equal to the emissions of sulfur
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, or mercury respectively. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acid</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rain Program</ENAMEX> and the NOx SIP call, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> of each
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> must hold allowances at least equal to annual
emissions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX> revises the existing Section
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">403</NUMEX> to provide for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>-level, rather than unit-level
compliance: beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> and nitrogen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxides</ENAMEX> and beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> of
each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> must hold allowances at least
equal to the total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> emissions of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
In order to meet the allowance holding requirements for nitrogen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxides</ENAMEX> starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> or for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> starting
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> may use allowances
purchased in a direct sale from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> at a fixed price,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> or nitrogen oxides allowance
(covering <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one ton</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,187.50</NUMEX> for a mercury allowance (covering
one ounce). These prices will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> adjusted for inflation.
For the direct sales, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> will use allowances from
future auctions. If this results in the removal of all allowances
from the relevant auction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three consecutive years</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> must conduct and submit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> a study to
determine whether revisions to the relevant trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> are
necessary.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 404</ENAMEX>. Permits and Compliance Plans
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 404</ENAMEX> is the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 408</ENAMEX>, modified to apply to
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, and mercury trading
programs essentially the same permit provisions that apply to the
existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program. Certain permitting provisions unique to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program are moved to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subpart 1</NUMEX> of Part B or, if
expired, are deleted. The requirements of all the trading programs
must be reflected in permits issued to the affected facilities
under this section and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title V of the Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>. The permits
must prohibit (i) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> in excess of the allowances held and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) use of allowances before the period for which the allowances
were issued. Each permit application must include a statement that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> will meet the applicable allowance holding
requirements, and such statement serves as the compliance plan
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title V</ENAMEX> for these trading programs. The existing Section 408
is revised to provide that a permit application covering a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> in
a particular trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> must be submitted to the permitting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> in accordance with the deadline established under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V</ENAMEX>, rather than the deadline (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-four months</TIMEX> before a new
unit commences operation) under existing Section 408.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 405</ENAMEX>. Monitoring, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reporting</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recordkeeping</ENAMEX>
Requirements
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 405</ENAMEX> is the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 412</ENAMEX>, modified to apply to
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, and mercury trading
programs essentially the same monitoring, reporting and
recordkeeping requirements that apply to the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acid Rain</ENAMEX>
Program. Continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) must be
installed and operated to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> from each affected
unit. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> under the new trading programs must monitor the
parameters required under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program (i.e., sulfur
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, opacity, and volumetric flow), and those
units subject to the mercury trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> must monitor mercury
as well. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> must specify requirements for any
alternative monitoring system shown to provide information with the
same precision, reliability, accessibility, and timeliness as that
provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEMS</ENAMEX>. Further, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> may specify an
alternative monitoring system for determining mercury <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> to
the extent that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> determines that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEMS</ENAMEX> for mercury
with appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> guarantees are not commercially available.
Existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 412</ENAMEX> is revised to provide that, consistent with
the requirement of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>-level compliance in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> will not require a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEMS</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> where
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more units utilize a single stack, unless data for
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are required under another provision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean</ENAMEX>
Air Act.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 405</ENAMEX> also sets deadlines for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> of units
to install and operate continuous emissions monitoring systems to
monitor specified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> or parameters under the new trading
programs. The deadlines are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> becomes
subject to the relevant trading program. The existing deadline for
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program is retained. This section also
retains the requirements in the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 412</ENAMEX> concerning the
use of substitute data when emission data from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEMS</ENAMEX> or an
approved alternative monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> are not available during any
period and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> cannot provide information,
satisfactory to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>, on emissions during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> already issued regulations implementing the
existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 412</ENAMEX> and must issue new regulations by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> for monitoring of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 406</ENAMEX>. Excess <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Emissions Penalty; General Compliance With</ENAMEX>
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provisions; Enforcement</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 406</ENAMEX> is the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 411</ENAMEX>, modified to address
excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> penalties with regard to emissions of sulfur
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>. The excess emissions
penalties reflect changes from the allowance holding requirements
from unit-level to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>-level compliance in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX>. For
example, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-2007</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> that fails to hold allowances covering its
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide emissions</ENAMEX> is treated as having excess
emissions. Starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> and nitrogen oxides
and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> that
fails to hold allowances covering the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> emissions of its
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> is treated as having excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> must
both offset the excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> with an equal amount of allowances
and pay a financial penalty. In contrast with the existing Section
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">411</NUMEX>, which imposes a full financial penalty starting immediately
after the deadline for holding allowances covering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 406</ENAMEX> imposes a financial penalty that is graduated, with the
penalty increasing the longer the period before the excess
emissions are offset and the financial penalty is paid. If the
offset and penalty payment are made within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> after the
deadline for holding allowances, the penalty per ton or, for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX>, per ounce of excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> equals the clearing price of
an allowance in the most recent auction. If the offset and penalty
payment are made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 or more days</TIMEX> after the deadline, the penalty is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times the auction clearing price. For all the trading
programs and consistent with the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 411</ENAMEX>, the excess
emissions penalty does not preclude imposition, in addition, of
civil penalties for violations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 406</ENAMEX> also includes the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 413</ENAMEX>. As under the
existing provision, compliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Title</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> does not affect,
except as expressly provided, the application of other requirements
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 406</ENAMEX> also provides that no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> or
political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subdivision</ENAMEX> thereof shall restrict or interfere with the
transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances under this title.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 406</ENAMEX> also includes the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 414</ENAMEX> and applies
to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, and mercury trading
programs essentially the same enforcement provisions that apply to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program. Like each excess ton of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, each
ton of excess nitrogen oxides or each excess ounce of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> is a
separate violation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 407</ENAMEX>. Election <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">For Additional Units</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 407</ENAMEX> provides the option for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are not otherwise
subject to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, and mercury
trading programs to opt into the programs if certain conditions are
met. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> must vent all their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> emissions only through a stack or duct and must meet
the monitoring and reporting requirements for those trading
programs, except that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> must be separately monitored. Each
unit, to establish its baseline, must monitor and report its
emissions in accordance with the monitoring and reporting
requirements under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 405</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> before entering the
programs.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> will allocate to an opt-in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> an amount of
allowances equal to fifty percent of: the lesser of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s
baseline heat input or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s heat input for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> before
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> is determining the allocation;
multiplied by the lesser of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s baseline emission rate, the
unit's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> emissions rate, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s most stringent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> or
federal emission limitation applicable to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> on which the
unit's baseline heat input is based. Moreover, the allocation is
subject to an increasing reduction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> (a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> increase
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 percent</NUMEX> reduction each year
thereafter), with a corresponding increase in the amounts of
allowances auctioned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. This is analogous to how
allowances and auctions are handled for affected electricity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generating units</ENAMEX> (EGUs) under the trading programs.
Once a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> opts into the trading programs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> will remain
an affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. The only circumstance under which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> will be
withdrawn from the opt-in provisions is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> qualifies as
an affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU</ENAMEX> independently of the opt-in provisions. In that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">circumstance</ENAMEX>, the unit remains subject to the trading programs but
is covered by the non-opt-in requirements that cover all affected
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 408</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean Coal Technology Regulatory Incentives</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 408</ENAMEX> is the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 415</ENAMEX>, which addresses the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean Coal Technology Program</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 409</ENAMEX>. Auctions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 409</ENAMEX> requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> to issue regulations
within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 months</TIMEX> of enactment concerning auctions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allowances</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxide allowances, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury allowances</ENAMEX>. The
regulations must specify the procedures, frequency, and timing of
auctions. Allowances may be auctioned before or during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> for
which the allowances are issued, and auctions may be conducted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
or more times during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. The auctions must be open to any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and there will not be any minimum price set for the
auctions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> may, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> or contract, provide
for conduct of an auction by another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government agency</ENAMEX> or
non-governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The proceeds from
all auctions will be deposited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX>.
This section also establishes detailed default procedures for
auctions. The procedures will apply if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> is
required to conduct an auction but has not yet issued regulations
establishing procedures. The default procedures provide for the
sale of all allowances at a single, clearing price. This contrasts
with the auction provisions in the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 416</ENAMEX> providing
for a declining price auction where winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidders</ENAMEX> purchase
allowances at their bid prices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 410</ENAMEX>. Evaluation of Limitations on Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sulfur Dioxide</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nitrogen Oxides</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">And Mercury Emissions That Start</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 410</ENAMEX> establishes criteria and the process by which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Administrator</ENAMEX> reviews and makes recommendations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> as to
whether the limitations on the total amounts of allowances
available starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen oxides, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> (whether through allocation or auction) should be adjusted.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>, in consultation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX>,
must conduct a study that addresses a number of specific factors
regarding, among other things: the need for further reductions of
these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> from affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to attain or
maintain the national ambient air quality standards; whether
adjusting any of the limitations would have benefits that would
justify the costs of such adjustment; the relative marginal cost
effectiveness of the reductions from affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX>; and the
feasibility of attaining the limitations and any alternative
limitations. In addition, the study must address the most current
scientific information relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX>, transformation, and
deposition of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>. Any documents considered in such a
study must be independently peer-reviewed no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX>. The results of the study itself must be independently
peer-reviewed no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2009</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> must
make any recommendations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1, 2009</TIMEX> and
may submit separate recommendations addressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur oxides</ENAMEX>,
nitrogen oxides, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any time</TIMEX> after the study and the
peer review have been completed.
Part <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">B. Sulfur Dioxide Emission Reductions</ENAMEX>
Subpart <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of Part B retains the requirements of the existing

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Subpart 2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sulfur Dioxide Allowance Program</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 421</ENAMEX>. Definitions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 421</ENAMEX> contains the definitions unique to the new sulfur
dioxide trading program. The definition of the term "affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU</ENAMEX>"
establishes which electricity generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are covered by the
new trading program. The program covers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and its
territories. The program includes existing fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>-fired
electricity generating boilers and turbines and integrated
gasification combined cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with generators having a
nameplate capacity of greater than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 MW</TIMEX>. The program also includes
new fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>-fired electricity generating boilers and turbines
and integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gasification</ENAMEX> combined cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> regardless of
size, except for gas-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> serving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more generators
with total nameplate capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MW</ENAMEX> or less. In addition,
certain existing and new cogeneration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are exempt, as well as
solid waste incineration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> for treatment, storage, or
disposal of hazardous waste.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 422</ENAMEX>. Applicability
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 422</ENAMEX> provides that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must hold
allowances for all the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> at least equal
to the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> emissions for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> during the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. Compliance with the requirement to hold allowances covering
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> emissions will thus be determined on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>-wide
basis. This is reflected in the monitoring and reporting
requirements, which provide that units sharing a common stack do
not need to be separately monitored and must collect sufficient
information to determine compliance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 423</ENAMEX>. Limitations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Total Emissions</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 423</ENAMEX> establishes the annual caps on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
emissions for affected EGUs: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,500,000 tons</NUMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000,000 tons</NUMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> of the new
trading program, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of the allowances will be allocated to
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> with an auction for the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>. Each subsequent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 1%</NUMEX> of the allowances for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX>, and then
an additional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> thereafter, will be auctioned until eventually
all the allowances are auctioned. Auction proceeds will go into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 424</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU Allocations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 424</ENAMEX> requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> to determine individual
EGU allocations, which will set on a one-time basis and therefore
will remain the same <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> percent of the total
amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances allocated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> under
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 423</ENAMEX> will be allocated based on the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
allowances allocated under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and
thereafter and that are held in allowance accounts in the Allowance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tracking System</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the date 180 days</TIMEX> after enactment. In
determining the amount of allowances in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> account and
general account as of that deadline, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> will
discount allowances allocated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2011</TIMEX> or later at a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
percent per year to reflect the time value of allowances.
The remaining allowances are allocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that do not
receive allowances under the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acid Rain Program</ENAMEX>, whether because
they are subject to the program and have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> allocation or
because they are simply not subject to the program. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> and
one-half percent of the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances
allocated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> will be allocated to such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> under the new trading program as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2004</TIMEX>
and commenced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2001</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX>
percent of the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances will be
allocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2004</TIMEX>
and commence operation during the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2001- December</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 2004</TIMEX>. Allowances will be allocated based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>' baseline
heat input multiplied by standard emission rates that vary
depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> combusted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Standard emission
rates are established for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>: coal-fired
units; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>; and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. For each of the above
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> allowance pools, each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>'s allocation will be adjusted
to ensure that the total amount of allowances allocated does not
exceed the applicable total of allowances available for allocation
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances was
already established for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acid Rain Program</ENAMEX>, and essentially the
same system will be used for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> trading
program. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> must still promulgate
regulations determining the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> allocations for a given
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. In the event that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> is unable, for any
reason, to promulgate allocation regulations on a timely basis,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 424</ENAMEX> provides a default method for distributing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allowances</ENAMEX>, without promulgation of regulations, in advance of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> for which the allowances are necessary so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> can plan for compliance. Under the default method, eighty
percent of the total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances available
for allocation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> will be allocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program
units with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> as their primary or secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> or residual oil
as their primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>, listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>'s Emissions

Units). The allocations will be based on the heat input of those
units as set forth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Emissions Scorecard 2000</ENAMEX>, which
summarizes the emissions data received by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</NUMEX> of the total amount of sulfur
dioxide allowances available for allocation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> will be
auctioned. The remaining fifteen percent of the allowances will not
be made available, whether through allocation or auction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 425</ENAMEX>. Disposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">SO2 Allowances Allocated</ENAMEX> Under
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Subpart 1</ENAMEX>
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 425</ENAMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> allocates allowances
under the new trading program, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> will remove from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX> accounts all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
allowances for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2010</TIMEX> and later that were allocated under
Subpart <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of this Part. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> will promulgate
regulations to allow use of any banked pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2009</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
allowances in the new nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> program.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 426</ENAMEX>. Incentives <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">For Sulfur Dioxide Emission Control</ENAMEX>
Technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 426</ENAMEX> establishes a reserve of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> allowances for
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> that combusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> bituminous and that, before
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX>, install and operate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> control technology and
continue to combust such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>. A procedure is established for
submission of applications by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and approval of
applications and award of allowances by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>. The
procedure is designed to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> will approve
those qualified projects that will result in the largest amount of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> emission reductions achieved per allowance
awarded.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Subpart 3</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Regional Air Partnership</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX>)
This Subpart establishes a back-stop trading program that will
go into effect if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX> (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>) are unable to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> emission level
(<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">271,000 tons</NUMEX>) that they established for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX> for electricity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> emitting <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 100 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> per year.
In general, if that emission level is exceeded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX> or later,
the trading program, which reflects the back-stop trading program
already developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX> and is modeled after the new
nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> trading program, will require a separate
set of allowances for affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP State</ENAMEX> to be held
covering emissions starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year</TIMEX> after the level is
exceeded. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX> and nationwide programs are separate: sulfur
dioxide allowances in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WRAP</ENAMEX> program may not be used in the
nationwide program; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances in the
nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> may not be used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WRAP</ENAMEX> program.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 431</ENAMEX>. Definitions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 431</ENAMEX> contains the definitions unique to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX>
trading program. The definition of the term "affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU</ENAMEX>"
establishes which electricity generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are covered by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">new WRAP</ENAMEX> trading program. The program covers those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> covered by
the new nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> trading program that are located
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX> and that, in any year starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>,
emit <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 100 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> and are used to produce
electricity for sale.
The definition of "covered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>" establishes when the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX>
trading program will begin. Generally, the trading program and the
requirement to hold allowances will begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year</TIMEX> after the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> (starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>) in which the total emissions of affected
EGUs exceed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">271,000 tons</NUMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP States</ENAMEX> may unanimously
petition the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> to determine that the total emissions of
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> are reasonably projected to exceed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">271,000 tons</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX> or a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later year</TIMEX> and to make affected EGUs subject to the
requirements of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX> trading program. Based on such a
petition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> may by regulation make affected EGUs
subject to the requirement to hold allowances starting the third
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> (starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2013</TIMEX>) when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>
makes such a determination. The term "covered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>" also includes
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> in which the requirement to hold
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allowances</ENAMEX> begins.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 432</ENAMEX>. Applicability
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 432</ENAMEX> provides that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must hold
allowances for all the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> at least equal
to the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> emissions for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> during each
covered year. As in the new nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> trading
program, compliance with the requirement to hold allowances will
thus be determined on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>-wide basis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 433</ENAMEX>. Limitations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Total Emissions</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 433</ENAMEX> establishes the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> cap on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>

<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">271,000 tons</NUMEX> in each covered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 434</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU Allocations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 434</ENAMEX> establishes the procedures for determining
allocations for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> as of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31 of the fourth year</TIMEX> before the covered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allocations</ENAMEX> will be set on a one-time basis and therefore will
remain the same <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. Allowances will be allocated based on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>' baseline heat input multiplied by standard emission
rates that vary depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> combusted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
Standard emission rates are set forth for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories of
units: coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>; and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX>'s allocation will be adjusted to ensure that the total
amount of allowances allocated does not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">271,000 tons</NUMEX> per
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> allowances was
already established for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acid Rain Program</ENAMEX>, and essentially the
same system will be used for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRAP</ENAMEX> trading program. However,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> must still promulgate regulations determining the
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> allocations for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given year</TIMEX>. In the event that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> is unable, for any reason, to promulgate allocation
regulations on a timely basis, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 434</ENAMEX> provides a default
methodology analogous to that for the new nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
trading program for distributing the allowances, without
promulgation of regulations, in advance of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> for which the
allowances are necessary. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighty</NUMEX> percent of the total amount of

existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program for nitrogen oxides reduction. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Subpart 2</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">establishes</ENAMEX>, beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2008</TIMEX>, a new nitrogen oxides
trading program. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> trading zones are established, and, only
allowances allocated or auctioned for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> may be used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> within that zone to meet the requirement to hold
allowances covering emissions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Subpart 3</ENAMEX> codifies the budgets and
other requirements in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s rulemaking (known as the NOx SIP call)
concerning ozone transport in the Eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, which requires that
certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern States</ENAMEX> revise their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> implementation plans to
reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOx</ENAMEX> emissions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Subpart 1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nitrogen Oxides Emission Reduction</ENAMEX> Program
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 441</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nitrogen Oxides Emission Rate Reduction Program</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 441</ENAMEX> is the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 407</ENAMEX>, which includes the
emission rate limitations and other
requirements for nitrogen oxides under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program.
The existing emission rate limitations for individual boilers,
which are based on boiler type, are not changed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 442</ENAMEX>. Termination
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 442</ENAMEX> terminates the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program nitrogen
oxides provisions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 441</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2008</TIMEX> when the new
nitrogen oxides trading program begins.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Subpart 2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nitrogen Oxides Allowance Program</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 451</ENAMEX>. Definitions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 451</ENAMEX> contains the definitions unique to the new nitrogen
oxides trading program. The definition of the term "affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU</ENAMEX>"
establishes which electricity generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are covered by the
new nitrogen oxides trading program, which are the same electricity
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> as are covered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX> by the
new nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> trading program.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 452</ENAMEX>. Applicability
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 452</ENAMEX> provides that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must hold
allowances for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> at least equal to
the total nitrogen oxides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> during the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. As in the new nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> trading program,
compliance with the requirement to hold allowances will thus be
determined on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>-wide basis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 453</ENAMEX>. Limitations on total emissions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 453</ENAMEX> establishes the annual caps on nitrogen oxides
emissions affected EGUs: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.562 million tons</NUMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.162 million tons</NUMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zone 1</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">538,000 tons</NUMEX>
starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zone 2</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> of the new
trading program, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> of the allowances will be allocated to
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with an auction for the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>. Each
subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">an additional 1%</NUMEX> of the allowances for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and then an additional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> thereafter, will be auctioned
until eventually all the allowances are auctioned. Auction proceeds
will go into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 454</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU Allocations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 454</ENAMEX> establishes the procedures for determining
allocations for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> as of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2004</TIMEX>. The allocations will be set on a one-time basis
and therefore will remain the same <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. Allowances will be
allocated to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> in a given zone in proportion to the sum of
the baseline heat input values of affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> as
compared to the total baseline heat input of all affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> in
the respective zone. Thus, the two separate allowances <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> for
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> zones are separately allocated. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>'s allocation
will be adjusted to ensure that the total amount of allowances
allocated does not exceed the applicable total amount of allowances
available for allocation for the zone for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> involved.
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allowances</ENAMEX> was already established for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acid Rain Program</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> must, under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX>, establish by regulation the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX> for nitrogen oxides allowances. Further,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> must also promulgate regulations determining the
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> allocations for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given year</TIMEX>. In the event that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> is unable, for any reason, to promulgate allocation
regulations on a timely basis, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 454</ENAMEX> provides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> default
methods for compliance, both of which are implemented separately
for the two zones. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> default method, which is analogous to
the default under the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> trading program, applies
if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX> regulations are timely promulgated
but not the allocation regulations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighty</NUMEX> percent of the total
amount of nitrogen oxides allowances available for allocation each
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> will be allocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> as
their primary or secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> or residual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> as their primary
fuel, listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Emissions Scorecard 2000</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five</TIMEX>
percent of the total amount of allowances available for allocation
will be auctioned, and the remaining fifteen percent will not be
made available. However, if neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX>
regulations nor the allocation regulations are timely promulgated,
then the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> default applies under which each affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU</ENAMEX> is
required for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> involved to meet an emission rate limit of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/mmBtu for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zone 1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/mmBtu for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Zone 2</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Subpart 3</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ozone Season NOx</ENAMEX> Budget Program
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 461</ENAMEX>. Definitions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 461</ENAMEX> contains definitions unique to the NOx SIP call.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 462</ENAMEX>. General Provisions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 462</ENAMEX> provides that the general provisions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Sections</ENAMEX> 402
through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">406</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 409</ENAMEX> of Part A do not apply to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subpart</ENAMEX>.
This is because the NOx SIP call itself, and the state
implementation plans approved under the NOx SIP call, already
include provisions concerning the matters addressed in these
general provisions in Part A, such as tracking and transferring of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allowances</ENAMEX>, permitting, monitoring and reporting, and
compliance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 463</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applicable Implementation Plan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 463</ENAMEX> requires implementation of the requirements of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NOx SIP</ENAMEX> call beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> including requirements contained in
a proposed rulemaking by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> concerning: the amounts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
trading budgets; the criteria for classifying cogeneration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">units</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> and non-EGUs; and the treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> that are only
partially in the NOx SIP call area.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 464</ENAMEX>. Termination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx Trading Program</ENAMEX> for Clear Skies
Units
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 464</ENAMEX> terminates the obligation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> to
administer the ozone season <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX> budget trading program under the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NOx SIP</ENAMEX> call on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2008</TIMEX>. The section allows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> to
continue, and to administer, such a program in their state
implement plans under the NOx SIP call for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX> and thereafter.
However, it is intended that affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> under the new nitrogen
oxides trading program will generally not be subject to the
requirements of the NOx SIP call starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2008</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 465</ENAMEX>. Carryforward of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pre-2008 Nitrogen</ENAMEX> Oxides
Allowances
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 465</ENAMEX> requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> to promulgate regulations
allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> to carry over, into the new nitrogen
oxides trading program under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Subpart 2</ENAMEX>, any banked pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2008</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> under the NOx SIP call.
Part <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">D. Mercury Emissions Reductions</ENAMEX>
Part D establishes a new trading program for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>, with a
requirement to hold allowances covering emissions beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2010</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 471</ENAMEX>. Definitions
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 471</ENAMEX> contains the definitions unique to the new mercury
trading program. The definition of the term "affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU</ENAMEX>"
establishes which electricity generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are covered by the
new trading program. The new mercury trading program covers
coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are covered by the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> and
nitrogen oxides trading programs. The definition for "adjusted
baseline heat input" establishes a modified baseline heat input
value, which, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with an operating history, is adjusted by a
standard factor to reflect the types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> that were combusted.
Standard factors are set forth for several categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lignite</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.25</NUMEX> for subbituminous; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> for bituminous or
other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 472</ENAMEX>. Applicability
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 472</ENAMEX> provides that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must hold
allowances for all the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGUs</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> at least equal
to the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury emissions</ENAMEX> for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. As
in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> and nitrogen oxides trading programs,
compliance with the requirement to hold allowances will thus be
determined on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>-wide basis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 473</ENAMEX>. Limitations on Total Emissions Section 463
establishes the annual caps on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury emissions</ENAMEX> for affected EGUs:
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 tons</NUMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 tons</NUMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>. During the

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX>, and then an additional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX> thereafter, will be
auctioned until eventually all the allowances are auctioned.
Auction proceeds will go into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 474</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGU Allocations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 434</ENAMEX> establishes the procedures for determining
allocations for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that are affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGUs</ENAMEX> as of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2004</TIMEX>. The allocations will be set on a one-time basis
and therefore will remain the same <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. Allowances will be
allocated based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>' baseline heat input, which, for units
with an operating history, is adjusted by a standard factor to
reflect the types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> that were combusted. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>'s
allocation will be adjusted to ensure that the total amount of
allowances allocated does not exceed the applicable amount of
allowances available for allocation for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allowances</ENAMEX> was already established for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acid Rain Program</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> must, under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 403</ENAMEX>, establish by regulation the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> must also promulgate regulations determining the
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> allocations for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given year</TIMEX>. In the event that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> is unable, for any reason, to promulgate allocation
regulations on a timely basis, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 474</ENAMEX> provides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> default
methods for compliance analogous to those under the new nitrogen
oxides trading program. Under the first default, eighty percent of
the total amount of mercury allowances allocated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> will be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allocated to Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> listed in the

amount of allowances available for allocation will be auctioned,
and the remaining fifteen percent will not be made available.
However, if neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allowance Tracking System</ENAMEX> regulations nor

default applies under which each affected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EGU</ENAMEX> must comply with an
emission limit of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> content (in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ounces</NUMEX> per

Part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E. National Emission Standards; Research; Environmental</ENAMEX>
Accountability
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 481</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Emission Standards for Affected Units</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 481</ENAMEX> establishes performance standards for all new

cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that are affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> under the new trading
programs. "New" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are those that commence construction or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> after enactment.
These statutory performance standards include emission limits
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>: nitrogen oxides; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>;
and particulate matter. The mercury emission limits apply only to
coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. A particulate matter emission limit is
established for existing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-fired boilers that will also reduce
emissions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel</ENAMEX> from such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. All units subject to a
performance standard are required to monitor emissions using
continuous emissions monitoring systems and to use averaging times
similar to those under the existing new source performance
standards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boilers</ENAMEX> and integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gasification</ENAMEX> combined cycle plants are

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> emission limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.015</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/GWh, but alternative standards
apply in some circumstances. Coal-fired combustion turbines are
subject to the same emission limits as coal-fired boilers and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> gasification combined cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. (The term
"coal-fired" is defined to include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that burn any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> or
coal-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>.) Gas-fired combustion turbines are subject to

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> is required, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least every eight years</TIMEX>, to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and, if appropriate revise, these performance standards to
reflect the degree of emission limitation achievable through
application of the best system of emission reduction which the

such review is not required if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> determines that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> is not appropriate in light of readily available information
on the efficacy of the standard. New affected units subject to the

case-by-case review of the appropriate control technology, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACT</ENAMEX> or the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER), will be
required.
An affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> located within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 km</NUMEX> of Class I areas will
remain subject to the requirements in Part C of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title I</ENAMEX> for the

construction of such a new or modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> may not cause or
contribute to the violation of a Class I increment unless the
federal land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> certifies that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> from the facility
will have no adverse impact on the air quality related values of
the Class I area. Further, as provided under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 110</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(C),
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> must still ensure that the construction of a new or modified
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> will not cause or contribute to a violation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) or interfere with
the programs to assure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAAQS</ENAMEX> are met. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> must provide
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> with an opportunity to comment on the impact of the new
or modified affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAAQS</ENAMEX> or on any Class I areas
within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 km</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title I of the Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 107</ENAMEX>. Transitional Areas
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act revises Section 107 of the Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> to
authorize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate</ENAMEX> as transitional an area
for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>-performed modeling demonstrates that the area will
attain the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-hour</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> or fine particles NAAQS no later than
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2015</TIMEX> through the controls provided under the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX> and any other federal controls that have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promulgated</ENAMEX>. In addition, an area may be classified as transitional
if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> performs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPAapproved</ENAMEX> modeling demonstrating that the
area will attain the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-hour</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> or fine particles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAAQS</ENAMEX> by no
later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2015</TIMEX> through a combination of reductions
achieved through controls established through the Clear Skies Act
and any other federal controls that have been promulgated, together
with any necessary local controls that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> adopts in its
state implementation plan no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2004</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Areas</ENAMEX> designated as transitional will not be subject to certain
local planning obligations that apply to areas designated
nonattainment, such as conformity and new source review. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> are subject to the new source program that applies in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attainment</ENAMEX> and maintenance areas. In addition, these areas need to
ensure that growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> following the time of designation
does not negatively affect their ability to attain the standard.
Finally, if an area fails to attain the standard by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2015</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> will be required to redesignate the area to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonattainment</ENAMEX> and the area will then be subject to the
nonattainment planning requirements, including conformity and new
source review.
In addition, the time frames for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> to recommend, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> to
promulgate, designations for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-hour</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> and fine particles
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAAQS</ENAMEX> are revised to align the time frames for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> to designate
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> for these standards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SECTIONS 110, 126</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ozone Transport Provisions</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> restricts the applicability of petitions
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 126 of the Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>, and the requirements of the
state implementation plan (SIP) "good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>" provisions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 110</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>, to affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> under
the new trading programs.
In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 126</ENAMEX> authorizes downwind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> or political
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subdivisions</ENAMEX> to petition the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> to find that certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upwind</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> emit air pollutants in amounts that contribute
significantly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">petitioner</ENAMEX>'s air pollution problems. If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> grants the finding, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> must either shut down
or implement controls that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> may mandate within a
specified period, but no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> from the date of
the finding. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act revises Section 126</ENAMEX> to provide
that if any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> submits a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 126</ENAMEX> petition concerning
emissions from an affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> may not grant
any finding prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2009</TIMEX>, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>
must take final action during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January, 2009</TIMEX> on any petition
submitted prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2007</TIMEX>. Further, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>
grants a requested finding, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> must assure that
the compliance and implementation deadlines are extended beyond
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2011</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> further requires that, in addressing a
petition submitted after enactment that requests a finding for any
affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> under the new trading programs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX>
must consider, among other factors, any emissions reductions
required to occur by any applicable attainment dates for any
relevant nonattainment areas. In addition, as conditions for making
a finding concerning affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> must
determine that the required emissions reductions from the affected
units are at least as cost-effective, and will improve air quality
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">petitioners</ENAMEX>' nonattainment areas at least as
cost-effectively, as emissions reductions from each other principal
category of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in areas upwind of the petitioner. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> must develop an appropriate peer-reviewed methodology
for making the necessary determinations by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2006</TIMEX>.
Corresponding changes are made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SIP</ENAMEX> requirements of Section
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> makes clear that these changes do
not affect the NOx SIP call rulemaking concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> transport
in the Eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, which requires that certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern States</ENAMEX>
revise their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIPs</ENAMEX> to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOx</ENAMEX> emissions.
Several corrections are also made to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 126</ENAMEX>, including
correction of an erroneous crossreference.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 112</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maximum Achievable Control Technology</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act revises Section 112 of the Clean Air Act</ENAMEX> to
preclude regulation through maximum achievable control technology
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MACT</ENAMEX>) standards of the emission of hazardous air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> by
electric utility steam generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> retains
the authority to address any non-mercury hazardous air pollutants
from electricity generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> set
forth under the existing residual risk authority provisions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 112</ENAMEX>(f)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) through (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title VIII of the Clean Air Act Amendments</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 821</ENAMEX>. Monitoring
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act revises Section 821</ENAMEX>(a) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Air Act</ENAMEX>
Amendments of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to retain the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> monitoring
and reporting requirements for units subject to the existing Acid
Rain Program.
