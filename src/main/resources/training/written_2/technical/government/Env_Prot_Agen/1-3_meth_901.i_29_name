2.1 INTRODUCTION


2.1.1
The objective of aquatic toxicity tests with effluents or
pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> is to estimate the "safe" or "no-effect"
concentration of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, which is defined as the
concentration which will permit normal propagation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and
other aquatic life in the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. The endpoints that have
been considered in tests to determine the adverse effects of
toxicants include death and survival, decreased reproduction and
growth, locomotor activity, gill ventilation rate, heart rate,
blood chemistry, histopathology, enzyme activity, olfactory
function, and terata. Since it is not feasible to detect and/or
measure all of these (and other possible) effects of toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> on a routine basis, observations in toxicity tests
generally have been limited to only a few effects, such as
mortality, growth, and reproduction.


2.1.2
Acute lethality is an obvious and easily observed effect
which accounts for its wide use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early</TIMEX> period of evaluation
of the toxicity of pure compounds and complex effluents. The
results of these tests were usually expressed as the concentration
lethal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the test organisms (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LC50</NUMEX>) over relatively short
exposure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>).


2.1.3
As exposure periods of acute tests were lengthened, the
LC50 and lethal threshold concentration were observed to decline
for many compounds. By lengthening the tests to include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
complete life cycles and observing the more subtle effects of the
toxicants, such as a reduction in growth and reproduction, more
accurate, direct, estimates of the threshold or safe concentration
of the toxicant could be obtained. However, laboratory life cycle
tests may not accurately estimate the "safe" concentration of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicants</ENAMEX> because they are conducted with a limited number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> under highly controlled, steady state conditions, and the
results do not include the effects of the stresses to which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> would ordinarily be exposed in the natural
environment.


2.1.4
An early published account of a full life cycle, fish
toxicity test was that of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephan</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>). In this study,
fathead minnows, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas, were exposed to a graded
series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticide concentrations</ENAMEX> throughout their life cycle, and
the effects of the toxicant on survival, growth, and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX> were measured and evaluated. This work was soon
followed by full life cycle tests using other toxicants and fish
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>.


2.1.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKim</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) evaluated the data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> full life cycle
tests, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> of which used the fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas,
and concluded that the embryo-larval and early juvenile life stages
were the most sensitive stages. He proposed the use of partial life
cycle toxicity tests with the early life stages (ELS) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> to
establish water quality criteria.


2.1.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sleight</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) found that exposure of critical
life stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> to toxicants provides estimates of chronically
safe concentrations remarkably similar to those derived from full
life cycle toxicity tests. They reported that "for a great majority
of toxicants, the concentration which will not be acutely toxic to
the most sensitive life stages is the chronically safe
concentration for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and that the most sensitive life stages are
the embryos and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fry</ENAMEX>." Critical life stage exposure was considered
to be exposure of the embryos during most, preferably all, of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryogenic</ENAMEX> (incubation) period, and exposure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fry</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> post-hatch for warm water <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> with embryogenic periods
ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-to-</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen days</TIMEX>, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX> post-hatch for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> with longer embryogenic periods. They concluded that in the
majority of cases, the maximum acceptable toxicant concentration
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MATC</ENAMEX>) could be estimated from the results of exposure of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">incubation</TIMEX>, and the larvae for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX>
post-hatch.


2.1.7
Because of the high cost of full life-cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> toxicity
tests and the emerging consensus that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ELS</ENAMEX> test data usually
would be adequate for estimating chronically safe concentrations,
there was a rapid shift by aquatic toxicologists to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30- to 90-day</TIMEX>
ELS toxicity tests for estimating chronically safe concentrations
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> adopted the policy that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ELS</ENAMEX> test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> could be used in establishing water quality criteria if data
from full life-cycle tests were not available (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
1980a).


2.1.8
Published reports of the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests indicate
that the relative sensitivity of growth and survival as endpoints
may be species dependent, toxicant dependent, or both. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parrish</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>) examined the literature on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests that used
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> and juveniles of the sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon
variegatus, and found that growth was not a statistically sensitive
indicator of toxicity in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> tests. They suggested that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">shortened to 14 days</TIMEX> posthatch and that growth be
eliminated as an indicator of toxic effects.


2.1.9
In a review of the literature on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> full life-cycle
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests performed to determine the chronically safe
concentrations of a wide variety of toxicants, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>, organics, inorganics, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergents</ENAMEX>, and complex
effluents, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woltering</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>) found that at the lowest effect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, significant reductions were observed in fry survival
in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX>, fry growth in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hatchability</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> of the
tests. He also found that fry survival and growth were very often
equally sensitive, and concluded that the growth response could be
deleted from routine application of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests. The net result
would be a significant reduction in the duration and cost of
screening tests with no appreciable impact on estimating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MATCs</ENAMEX> for
chemical hazard assessments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benoit et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>), however, found
larval growth to be the most significant measure of effect and
survival to be equally or less sensitive than growth in early
life-stage tests with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.




2.1.10
Efforts to further reduce the length of partial lifecycle
toxicity tests for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> without compromising their predictive value
have resulted in the development of an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-day</TIMEX>, embryo-larval
survival and teratogenicity test for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and other aquatic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrates</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>), and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX>
larval survival and growth test (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>).


2.1.11
The similarity of estimates of chronically safe
concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxicants</ENAMEX> derived from short-term, embryo-larval
survival and teratogenicity tests to those derived from full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> tests has been demonstrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cassidy</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>).


2.1.12
Use of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX>, fathead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimephales</ENAMEX> promelas,
larval survival and growth test was first proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount</ENAMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> annual meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for Environmental</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxicology and Chemistry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>). This test was
subsequently used by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> in field demonstrations
at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>), and at many other locations (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
1985c, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985d</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985e</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986b</TIMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986c</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986d</TIMEX>). Growth was frequently found to be more
sensitive than survival in determining the effects of complex
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effluents</ENAMEX>.


2.1.13
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>) performed three single toxicant
fathead minnow larval growth tests with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DURSBAN®</ENAMEX>,
using dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Superior</ENAMEX>. The results


were comparable to, and had confidence intervals that overlapped
with, chronic values reported in the literature for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> life-cycle tests.


2.1.14
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1987b</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1987c</NUMEX>) adapted the fathead
minnow larval growth and survival test for use with the sheepshead
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">minnow</ENAMEX> and the inland silverside, respectively. When daily renewal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-day</TIMEX> sheepshead minnow larval growth and survival tests and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELS</ENAMEX> tests were performed with industrial and municipal effluents,
growth was more sensitive than survival in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> larval
growth and survival tests, equally sensitive in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tests, and
less sensitive in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> test. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ELS</ENAMEX> test may
have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to 10</NUMEX> times more sensitive to effluents than the
larval growth and survival test. In tests using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>, the No
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Observable Effect Concentrations</ENAMEX> (NOECs) were the same for both
types of test, and growth was the most sensitive endpoint for both.
In a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> laboratory comparison, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> tests produced
identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOECs</ENAMEX> for survival and growth (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987a</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
indicate that the inland silverside is at least equally sensitive
or more sensitive to effluents and single compounds than the
sheepshead minnow, and can be tested over a wider salinity range,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-30‰</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987a</TIMEX>).


2.1.15
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lussier et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1987e</NUMEX>) determined that
survival and growth are often as sensitive as reproduction in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> life-cycle tests with the mysid, Mysidopsis
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bahia</ENAMEX>.


2.1.16
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nacci</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackim</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1987g</NUMEX>) compared the
results from the sea urchin fertilization test, using organic
compounds, with results from acute toxicity tests using the
freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, fathead minnows, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimphales</ENAMEX> promelas, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daphnia magna</ENAMEX>. The test was also compared to acute toxicity tests
using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> silverside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menidia</ENAMEX> menidia, and the mysid,
Mysidopsis bahia, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> organic
compounds, the results of the fertilization test and the acute
toxicity test correlated well (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">r2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>). However, the results of
the fertilization test with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> did not correlate well
with the results from the acute tests.


2.1.17
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1987f</NUMEX>) evaluated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> industrial effluents
containing heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">effluents</ENAMEX> containing
organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> (including dyes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> domestic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wastewaters</ENAMEX> using the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> red macroalga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champia</ENAMEX> parvula,
sexual reproduction test. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine single</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> were used to
compare the effects on sexual reproduction using a


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> exposure and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> exposure. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> tested, the chronic values were the same for both
tests.


2.1.18
The use of short-term toxicity tests in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES Program</ENAMEX>
is especially attractive because they provide a more direct
estimate of the safe concentrations of effluents in receiving
waters than was provided by acute toxicity tests, at an only
slightly increased level of effort, compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> full
life-cycle chronic and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ELS</ENAMEX> tests and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> mysid
life-cycle test.


2.2
TYPES OF TESTS




2.2.1
The selection of the test type will depend on the NPDES
permit requirements, the objectives of the test, the available
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, the requirements of the test organisms, and effluent
characteristics such as fluctuations in effluent
toxicity.


2.2.2
Effluent chronic toxicity is generally measured using a
multi-concentration, or definitive test, consisting of a control
and a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> effluent concentrations. The tests are
designed to provide dose-response information, expressed as the
percent effluent concentration that affects the survival,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertilization</ENAMEX>, growth, and/or development within the prescribed
period of time (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX>). The results of the tests
are expressed in terms of either the highest concentration that has
no statistically significant observed effect on those responses
when compared to the controls or the estimated concentration that
causes a specified <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> reduction in responses versus the
controls.


2.2.3
Use of pass/fail tests consisting of a single effluent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (e.g., the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> concentration or RWC) and
a control is not recommended. If the NPDES permit has a whole
effluent toxicity limit for acute toxicity at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, it is
prudent to use that permit limit as the midpoint of a series of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> effluent concentrations. This will ensure that there is
sufficient information on the dose-response relationship. For
example, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> is ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> then, the effluent concentrations
utilized in a test may be: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> effluent, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> +
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">/2</TIMEX>,


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RWC/4</NUMEX>. More specifically, if the RWC
= <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, the effluent concentrations used in the toxicity test would
be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> is <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> effluent
the concentrations may be: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> times the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> times the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RWC/4</NUMEX>.


2.2.4
Receiving (ambient) water toxicity tests commonly employ
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatments, a control and the undiluted receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, but
may also consist of a series of receiving water
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilutions</ENAMEX>.


2.2.5
A negative result from a chronic toxicity test does not
preclude the presence of toxicity. Also, because of the potential
temporal variability in the toxicity of effluents, a negative test
result with a particular sample does not preclude the possibility
that samples collected at some other time might exhibit chronic
toxicity.


2.2.6
The frequency with which chronic toxicity tests are
conducted under a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES</ENAMEX> permit is determined by the
regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> on the basis of factors such as the variability
and degree of toxicity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX>, production schedules, and
process changes.


2.2.7
Tests recommended for use in this methods manual may be
static non-renewal or static renewal. Individual methods specify
which type of test is to be conducted.


2.3
STATIC TESTS




2.3.1
Static non-renewal tests - The test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are exposed
to the same test solution for the duration of the test.


2.3.2
Static-renewal tests - The test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are exposed to
a fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> of the same concentration of sample every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h or
other prescribed interval, either by transferring the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> to another, or by replacing all or
a portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> in the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TOXICITY TEST</ENAMEX>
TYPES


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.4.1 STATIC NON-RENEWAL</ENAMEX>, SHORT-TERM TOXICITY TESTS:
Advantages:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Simple and inexpensive.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
More cost effective in determining compliance with permit
conditions.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited resources</ENAMEX> (space, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manpower</ENAMEX>, equipment) required;
would permit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to perform more tests in the same amount of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Smaller volume of effluent required than for static
renewal or flow-through tests.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Disadvantages:</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Dissolved oxygen</ENAMEX> (DO) depletion may result from high
chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), or

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Possible loss of toxicants through volatilization and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adsorption</ENAMEX> to the exposure vessels.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Generally less sensitive than renewal because the toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> may degrade or be adsorbed, thereby reducing the
apparent toxicity. Also, there is less chance of detecting slugs of
toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>, or other temporal variations in waste
properties.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2.4.2 STATIC RENEWAL</ENAMEX>, SHORT-TERM TOXICITY TESTS:
Advantages:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Reduced possibility of DO depletion from high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COD</ENAMEX> and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOD</ENAMEX>, or ill effects from metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the
test solutions.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Reduced possibility of loss of toxicants through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">volatilization</ENAMEX> and/or adsorption to the exposure
vessels.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Test organisms that rapidly deplete energy reserves are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> when the test solutions are renewed, and are maintained in a
healthier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Disadvantages:</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Require greater volume of effluent than non-renewal
tests.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Generally less chance of temporal variations in waste
properties.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</ENAMEX>


3.1.1
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> should develop and maintain an effective
health and safety program, requiring an ongoing commitment by the
laboratory management and includes: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> with the
responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a safety
program; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the preparation of a formal, written, health and

3.1.2
Collection and use of effluents in toxicity tests may
involve significant risks to personal safety and health. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personnel</ENAMEX>
collecting effluent samples and conducting toxicity tests should
take all safety precautions necessary for the prevention of bodily
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> which might result from ingestion or invasion of
infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, inhalation or absorption of corrosive or toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> through skin contact, and asphyxiation due to a lack of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> or the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noxious gases</ENAMEX>.


3.1.3
Prior to sample collection and laboratory work, personnel
should determine that all necessary safety equipment and materials
have been obtained and are in good condition.


3.1.4
Guidelines for the handling and disposal of hazardous
materials must be strictly followed.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LABORATORY SAFETY EQUIPMENT</ENAMEX>




3.2.2.1
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> (including mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>) should be
provided with safety equipment such as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> aid kits, fire
extinguishers, fire blankets, emergency showers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> spill
clean-up kits, and eye fountains.


3.2.2.2
Mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> should be equipped with a telephone
to enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to summon help in case of emergency.


3.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENERAL LABORATORY AND FIELD OPERATIONS</ENAMEX>




3.3.1
Work with effluents should be performed in compliance
with accepted rules pertaining to the handling of hazardous
materials (see safety manuals listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> and
Safety, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 3.5</NUMEX>). It is recommended that personnel
collecting samples and performing toxicity tests should not work
alone.


3.3.2
Because the chemical composition of effluents is usually
only poorly known, they should be considered as potential health
hazards, and exposure to them should be minimized. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fume</ENAMEX> and canopy
hoods over the toxicity test areas must be used whenever
possible.


3.3.3
It is advisable to cleanse exposed parts of the body
immediately after collecting effluent samples.


3.3.4
All containers should be adequately labeled to indicate
their contents.


3.3.5
Staff should be familiar with safety guidelines on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Material Safety Data Sheets</ENAMEX> for reagents and other chemicals
purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>. Incompatible materials should not be
stored together. Good housekeeping contributes to safety and
reliable results.


3.3.6
Strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and volatile organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX> employed in
glassware cleaning must be used in a fume hood or under an exhaust
canopy over the work area.


3.3.7
Electrical equipment or extension cords not bearing the
approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underwriter Laboratories</ENAMEX> must not be used. Ground-fault
interrupters must be installed in all "wet" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> where
electrical equipment is used.


3.3.8
Mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> should be properly grounded to
protect against electrical shock.


3.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DISEASE PREVENTION</ENAMEX>




3.4.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Personnel</ENAMEX> handling samples which are known or suspected
to contain human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> should be immunized against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tetanus</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">typhoid fever</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">polio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatitis</ENAMEX> B.

SAFETY MANUALS




3.5.1
For further guidance on safe practices when collecting
effluent samples and conducting toxicity tests, check with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permittee</ENAMEX> and consult general safety manuals, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1986e</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jameson</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>).


3.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WASTE DISPOSAL</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3.6.1 Wastes</ENAMEX> generated during toxicity testing must be properly
handled and disposed of in an appropriate manner. Each testing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX> will have its own waste disposal requirements based on
local, state and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> rules and regulations. It is extremely
important that these rules and regulations be known, understood,
and complied with by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> responsible for, or otherwise
involved in, performing toxicity testing activities. Local fire
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> should be notified of any potentially hazardous
conditions.
