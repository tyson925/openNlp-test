4.1 INTRODUCTION


4.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> and maintenance of a toxicity test laboratory
quality assurance (QA) program (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991b</TIMEX>) requires an ongoing
commitment by laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Each toxicity test laboratory
should (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) appoint a quality assurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> with the
responsibility and authority to develop and maintain a QA program,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) prepare a quality assurance plan with stated data quality
objectives (DQOs), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) prepare written descriptions of laboratory
standard operating procedures (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOPs</ENAMEX>) for culturing, toxicity
testing, instrument calibration, sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-of-custody
procedures, laboratory sample tracking system, glassware cleaning,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) provide an adequate, qualified technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">culturing</ENAMEX> and toxicity testing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, and suitable space
and equipment to assure reliable data.


4.1.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QA</ENAMEX> practices for toxicity testing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> must
address all activities that affect the quality of the final
effluent toxicity data, such as: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) effluent sampling and
handling; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and condition of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
condition of equipment; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) test conditions; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) instrument
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibration</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) replication; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) use of reference toxicants; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>)
record keeping; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) data evaluation.


4.1.3
Quality control practices, on the other hand, consist of
the more focused, routine, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> activities carried out within
the scope of the overall QA program. For more detailed discussion
of quality assurance and general guidance on good laboratory
practices and laboratory evaluation related to toxicity testing,
see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1979d</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1980b</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1980c</NUMEX>); USEPA
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1991c</NUMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DeWoskin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>); and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>).


4.1.4
Guidelines for the evaluation of laboratory performing
toxicity tests and laboratory evaluation criteria are found in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1991c</NUMEX>).


4.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AND TEST CHAMBERS</ENAMEX>




4.2.1
Separate test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism culturing</ENAMEX> and toxicity testing
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> should be provided to avoid possible loss of cultures due to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-contamination.</ENAMEX> Ventilation systems should be designed and
operated to prevent recirculation or leakage of air from chemical
analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> or sample storage and preparation areas into
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism culturing</ENAMEX> or testing areas, and from testing and sample
preparation areas into culture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>.


4.2.2
Laboratory and toxicity test temperature control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> must be adequate to maintain recommended test water
temperatures. Recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> must be used in the fabrication
of the test equipment which comes in contact with the effluent (see
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities, Equipment</ENAMEX>, and Supplies; and specific
toxicity test method).


4.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




4.3.1
The test organisms used in the procedures described in
this manual are the sheepshead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyprinodon</ENAMEX> variegatus; the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inland</ENAMEX> silverside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menidia</ENAMEX> beryllina; the mysid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysidopsis</ENAMEX> bahia;
the sea urchin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arbacia</ENAMEX> punctulata; and the red macroalga, Champia
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parvula</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> used should be disease-free and appear
healthy, behave normally, feed well, and have low mortality in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, during holding, and in test control. Test organisms
should be positively identified to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 6, Test</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organisms</ENAMEX>).


4.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LABORATORY WATER USED FOR</ENAMEX> CULTURING AND <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST DILUTION</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WATER</ENAMEX>


4.4.1 The quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used for test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism culturing</ENAMEX> and
for dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used in toxicity tests is extremely important.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uses should come from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX> used in effluent toxicity tests will depend on the
objectives of the study and logistical constraints, as discussed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 7, Dilution Water</ENAMEX>. The dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used in the toxicity
tests may be natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX>, hypersaline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100‰</ENAMEX>) prepared
from natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX>, or artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> prepared from
commercial sea salts, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FORTY FATHOMS®</ENAMEX> or HW MARINEMIX®, if
recommended in the method. GP2 synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX>, made from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical salts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">30‰</ENAMEX>) in conjunction with natural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seawater</ENAMEX>, may also be used if recommended. Hypersaline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">artificial seawater</ENAMEX> can be used with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champia</ENAMEX> parvula only if they
are accompanied by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 50%</NUMEX> natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX>. Types of water
are discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities, Equipment</ENAMEX>, and Supplies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> used for culturing and test dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> should be analyzed
for toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> and organics at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> or whenever
difficulty is encountered in meeting minimum acceptability criteria
for control survival and reproduction or growth. The concentration
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX>, As, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cr, Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zn</ENAMEX>, expressed as
total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>, should not exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 µg/L</ENAMEX> each, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX>,
expressed as total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>, should not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/L each. Total
organochlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> should be less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/L
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>). Pesticide concentrations should not exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ambient Water Quality</ENAMEX> chronic criteria values where
available.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.5 EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER</ENAMEX> SAMPLING AND HANDLING


4.5.1
Sample holding times and temperatures of effluent samples
collected for on-site and off-site testing must conform to
conditions described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 8, Effluent and Receiving Water</ENAMEX>
Sampling, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sample Handling, and Sample Preparation for Toxicity</ENAMEX>
Tests.


4.6
TEST CONDITIONS




4.6.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> temperature and salinity should be maintained
within the limits specified for each test. The temperature of test
solutions must be measured by placing the thermometer or probe
directly into the test solutions, or by placing the thermometer in
equivalent volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in surrogate vessels positioned at
appropriate locations among the test vessels. Temperature should be
recorded continuously in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> during the duration of
each test. Test solution temperatures should be maintained within
the limits specified for each test. DO concentrations and pH should
be checked at the beginning of the test and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> throughout the
test period.


4.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">QUALITY OF TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




4.7.1
The health of test organisms is primarily assessed by the
performance (survival, growth, and/or reproduction) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> treatments of individual tests. The health and sensitivity
of test organisms is also assessed by reference toxicant testing.
In addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, reference toxicant testing is used to initially
demonstrate acceptable laboratory performance (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.15</NUMEX>) and
to document ongoing laboratory performance (Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.16</NUMEX>).


4.7.2
Regardless of the source of test organisms (in-house
cultures or purchased from external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>), the testing
laboratory must perform at least one acceptable reference toxicant
test per month for each toxicity test method conducted in that
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.16</NUMEX>). If a test method is conducted only
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>, or less frequently, a reference toxicant test must be
performed concurrently with each effluent toxicity test.


4.7.3
When acute or short-term chronic toxicity tests are
performed with effluents or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> using test organisms
obtained from outside the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, concurrent toxicity
tests of the same type must be performed with a reference toxicant,
unless the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> provides control chart data from
at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five monthly</TIMEX> short-term chronic toxicity tests
using the same reference toxicant and test conditions (see Section
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, Test Organisms</ENAMEX>).


4.7.4
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> should certify the species identification of
the test organisms, and provide the taxonomic reference (citation
and page) or name(s) of the taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>(s)
consulted.


4.7.5
If a routine reference toxicant test fails to meet test
acceptability criteria, then the reference toxicant test must be
immediately repeated.


4.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOOD QUALITY</ENAMEX>




4.8.1
The nutritional quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> used in culturing and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">testing fish</ENAMEX> and invertebrates is an important factor in the
quality of the toxicity test data. This is especially true for the
unsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acid</ENAMEX> content of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine shrimp nauplii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Artemia</ENAMEX>.
Problems with the nutritional suitability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> will be
reflected in the survival, growth, and reproduction of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in cultures and toxicity tests. Artemia cysts and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foods</ENAMEX> must be obtained as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equipment</ENAMEX>, and Supplies.


4.8.2
Problems with the nutritional suitability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> will be
reflected in the survival, growth, and reproduction of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in cultures and toxicity tests. If a batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is
suspected to be defective, the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> fed with
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> can be compared with the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> fed
with a food of known quality in side-by-side tests. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is
used for culturing, its suitability should be determined using a
short-term chronic test which will determine the affect of food
quality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in culture, using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> replicates with each food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
Where applicable, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> used only in chronic toxicity tests can be
compared with a food of known quality in side-by-side,
multi-concentration chronic tests, using the reference toxicant
regularly employed in the laboratory QA program.


4.8.3
New batches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> used in culturing and testing should
be analyzed for toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> or whenever difficulty is
encountered in meeting minimum acceptability criteria for control
survival and reproduction or growth. If the concentration of total
organochlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX> µg/g wet weight, or the
concentration of total organochlorine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCBs</ENAMEX> exceeds
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.30 µg</NUMEX>/g wet weight, or toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX>, As, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cr, Cd, Cu, Pb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ni</ENAMEX>,
Zn, expressed as total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>) exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX> µg/g wet weight, the food
should not be used (for analytical methods, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOAC</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>; and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USDA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>).


4.84
For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YCT</ENAMEX>) which are used to culture and test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, the quality of the food should meet the requirements for
the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used for culturing and test dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> as
described in Section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX> above.


4.9
ACCEPTABILITY OF CHRONIC TOXICITY TESTS


4.9.1 The results of the sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon
variegatus, inland silverside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menidia</ENAMEX> beryllina, or mysid,
Mysidopsis bahia, tests are acceptable if survival in the controls
is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> or greater. The sea urchin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arbacia</ENAMEX> punctulata, test
requires control egg fertilization equal to or exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>.
However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> fertilization may result in masking toxic
responses. The red macroalga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champia</ENAMEX> parvula, test is acceptable
if survival is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, and the mean number of cystocarps per plant
should equal or exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. If the sheepshead minnow, Cyprindon
variegatus, larval survival and growth test is begun with
less-than-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h old larvae, the mean dry weight of the surviving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larvae</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> at the end of the test must equal or
exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.60 mg</NUMEX>, if the weights are determined immediately, or


0.50
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mg</ENAMEX> if the larvae are preserved in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> formalin or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol solution</ENAMEX>. If the inland silverside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menidia</ENAMEX> beryllina,
larval survival and growth test is begun with larvae <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>, the mean dry weight of the surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">larvae</ENAMEX> in the control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX> at the end of the test must equal or exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.50 mg</NUMEX>, if
the weights are determined immediately, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.43</NUMEX> mg if the larvae
are preserved in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> formalin or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol solution</ENAMEX>. The mean
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mysid</ENAMEX> dry weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> must be at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX> mg. Automatic
or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> feeding will generally provide control mysids with a dry
weight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX> mg. At least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> should bear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> at
the end of the test, but mysid fecundity is not a factor in test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptability</ENAMEX>. However, fecundity must equal or exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> to be
used as an endpoint in the test. If these criteria are not met, the
test must be repeated.


4.9.2
An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> test may be conditionally acceptable if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, DO, and other specified conditions fall outside
specifications, depending on the degree of the departure and the
objectives of the tests (see test conditions and test acceptability
criteria summaries). The acceptability of the test will depend on
the experience and professional judgment of the laboratory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and the reviewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of the regulatory authority.
Any deviation from test specifications must be noted when reporting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from a test.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4.10 ANALYTICAL METHODS</ENAMEX>


4.10.1
Routine chemical and physical analyses for culture and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and test solutions must include established
quality assurance practices outlined in USEPA methods manuals
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1979a</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979b</TIMEX>).


4.10.2
Reagent containers should be dated and catalogued when
received from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX>, and the shelf life should not be
exceeded. Also, working solutions should be dated when prepared,
and the recommended shelf life should be observed.


4.11
CALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATION




4.11.1
Instruments used for routine measurements of chemical and
physical parameters, such as pH, DO, temperature, conductivity, and
salinity, must be calibrated and standardized according to
instrument <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> procedures as indicated in the general
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> on quality assurance (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Methods 150.1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360.1</NUMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170.1</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120.1</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979b</TIMEX>). Calibration data are recorded in
a permanent log book.


4.11.2
Wet chemical methods used to measure hardness,
alkalinity, and total residual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX>, must be standardized prior
to use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> according to the procedures for those specific
USEPA methods (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Methods 130.2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">310.1</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
1979b).


4.12
REPLICATION AND <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST SENSITIVITY</ENAMEX>




4.12.1
The sensitivity of the tests will depend in part on the
number of replicates per concentration, the significance level
selected, and the type of statistical analysis. If the variability
remains constant, the sensitivity of the test will increase as the
number of replicates is increased. The minimum recommended number
of replicates varies with the objectives of the test and the
statistical method used for analysis of the data.


4.13
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VARIABILITY</ENAMEX> IN <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOXICITY TEST RESULTS</ENAMEX>




4.13.1
Factors which can affect test success and precision
include: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the experience and skill of the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>;
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) test organism age, condition, and sensitivity; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) dilution
water quality; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) temperature control; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) and the quality and
quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> provided. The results will depend upon the species
used and the strain or source of the test organisms, and test
conditions, such as temperature, DO, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and water quality. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repeatability</ENAMEX> or precision of toxicity tests is also a function of
the number of test organisms used at each toxicant concentration.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jensen</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>) discussed the relationship between sample size
(number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>) and the standard error of the test, and considered
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> per concentration as optimum for Probit
Analysis.


4.14
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST PRECISION</ENAMEX>




4.14.1
The ability of the laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to obtain
consistent, precise results must be demonstrated with reference
toxicants before they attempt to measure effluent toxicity. The
single-laboratory precision of each type of test to be used in a
laboratory should be determined by performing at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more
tests with a reference toxicant.


4.14.2
Test precision can be estimated by using the same strain
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> under the same test conditions, and employing a known
toxicant, such as a reference toxicant.


4.14.3
Interlaboratory precision data from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> study of
chronic toxicity tests using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reference toxicants with the
mysid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysidopsis</ENAMEX> bahia, and the inland silverside, Menidia
beryllina, is listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> shows interlaboratory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> data from a study of three chronic toxicity test methods
using effluent, receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and reference toxicant sample
types (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001b</TIMEX>). For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysidopsis</ENAMEX> bahia and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyprinodon</ENAMEX> variegatus test methods, the effluent sample was a
municipal wastewater spiked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sample
was a river water spiked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, and the reference toxicant
sample was bioassay-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FORTY</ENAMEX> FATHOMS®


synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> spiked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menidia</ENAMEX> beryllina
test method, the effluent sample was an industrial wastewater
spiked with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CuSO4</TIMEX>, the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sample was a natural
seawater spiked with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CuSO4</TIMEX>, and the reference toxicant sample was
bioassay-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FORTY FATHOMS®</ENAMEX> synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> spiked with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CuSO4</TIMEX>.
Additional precision data for each of the tests described in this
manual are presented in the sections describing the individual test
methods.


4.14.4
Additional information on toxicity test precision is
provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Support Document for Water Quality</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxic Control</ENAMEX> (see pp. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-4</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11-15</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991a</TIMEX>).


4.14.5
In cases where the test data are used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX>
or other point estimation techniques (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 9, Chronic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Toxicity Test Endpoints</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>), precision can be
described by the mean, standard deviation, and relative standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> coefficient of variation, or CV) of the
calculated endpoints from the replicated tests. In cases where the
test data are used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>, precision
can be estimated by empirical confidence intervals derived by using
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICPIN Method</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 9, Chronic Toxicity Test</ENAMEX> Endpoints
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>). However, in cases where the results are
reported in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">No-Observed-Effect-Concentration</ENAMEX> (NOEC)
and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lowest-Observed-Effect-Concentration</ENAMEX> (LOEC) (see Section 9,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chronic Toxicity Test Endpoints</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>), precision can
only be described by listing the NOEC-LOEC interval for each test.
It is not possible to express precision in terms of a commonly used
statistic. However, when all tests of the same toxicant yield the
same NOEC-LOEC interval, maximum precision has been attained. The
"true" no effect concentration could fall anywhere within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interval</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC ±</ENAMEX> (LOEC minus NOEC).


4.14.6
It should be noted here that the dilution factor selected
for a test determines the width of the NOEC-LOEC interval and the
inherent maximum precision of the test. As the absolute value of
the dilution factor decreases, the width of the NOEC-LOEC interval
increases, and the inherent maximum precision of the test
decreases. When a dilution factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> is used, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> could be
considered to have a relative uncertainty as high as ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">300%</NUMEX>. With a
dilution factor of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> could be considered to have a
relative variability of ± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>. As a result of the variability of
different dilution factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> recommends the use of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 0.5</NUMEX>
dilution factor. Other factors which can affect test precision
include: test organism age, condition, and sensitivity; temperature
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>; and feeding.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.15 DEMONSTRATING ACCEPTABLE LABORATORY</ENAMEX>
PERFORMANCE


4.15.1
It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s responsibility
to demonstrate its ability to obtain consistent, precise results
with reference toxicants before it performs toxicity tests with
effluents for permit compliance purposes. To meet this requirement,
the intralaboratory precision, expressed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> coefficient of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX> (CV<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>), of each type of test to be used in a laboratory
should be determined by performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or more tests with
different batches of test organisms, using the same reference
toxicant, at the same concentrations, with the same test conditions
(i.e., the same test duration, type of dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, age of test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, feeding, etc.), and same data analysis methods. A
reference toxicant concentration series (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX> or higher) should be
selected that will consistently provide partial mortalities at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
or more concentrations.


4.16
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOCUMENTING ONGOING LABORATORY PERFORMANCE</ENAMEX>




4.16.1
Satisfactory laboratory performance is demonstrated by
performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> acceptable test per month with a reference
toxicant for each toxicity test method conducted in the laboratory
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that month</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> test method, successive tests must
be performed with the same reference toxicant, at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, in the same dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, using the same data
analysis methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precision</ENAMEX> may vary with the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
reference toxicant, and type of test. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s reference
toxicity data will reflect conditions unique to that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>,
including dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, culturing, and other variables; however,
each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>'s reference toxicity results should reflect good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repeatability</ENAMEX>.


4.16.2
A control chart should be prepared for each combination
of reference toxicant, test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, test conditions, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX>. Toxicity endpoints from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six</NUMEX> tests are adequate
for establishing the control charts. Successive toxicity endpoints
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC25s</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50s</TIMEX>, etc.) should be plotted and examined to
determine if the results (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">X1</NUMEX>) are within prescribed limits (Figure
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The chart should plot logarithm of concentration on the
vertical axis against the date of the test or test number on the
horizontal axis. The types of control charts illustrated (see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979a</TIMEX>) are used to evaluate the cumulative trend of results
from a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, thus reference toxicant test results
should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of
individual effluent or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> tests. For endpoints that
are point estimates (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50s and IC25s</TIMEX>), the cumulative mean (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X¯</ENAMEX>) and
upper and lower control limits (± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2S</ENAMEX>) are re-calculated with each
successive test result. Endpoints from hypothesis tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAEC</ENAMEX>) from each test are plotted directly on the control chart.
The control limits would consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> concentration interval
above and below the concentration representing the central
tendency. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> of data collection, or a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> points, the control chart should be maintained using only the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most recent data points.


4.16.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX> should compare the calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> (i.e.,
standard deviation / mean) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most recent data
points to the distribution of laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported nationally
for reference toxicant testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculated CV</ENAMEX> exceeds the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">75th</NUMEX> percentile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported
nationally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> should use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 75th and 90th</TIMEX> percentiles
to calculate warning and control limits, respectively, and the
laboratory should investigate options for reducing variability.
Note: Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> can only be a fixed number of discrete values,
the mean, standard deviation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CV</ENAMEX> cannot be interpreted and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> in the same way that these descriptive statistics are
interpreted and applied for continuous variables such as the IC25
or LC50.



4.16.4
The outliers, which are values falling outside the upper
and lower control limits, and trends of increasing or decreasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, are readily identified. In the case of endpoints that
are point estimates (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50s and IC25s</TIMEX>), at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> probability
level, one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> tests would be expected to fall outside of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> limits by chance alone. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
reference toxicant tests fall outside the control limits, the
laboratory should investigate sources of variability, take
corrective actions to reduce identified sources of variability, and
perform an additional reference toxicant test during the same
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> limits for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> will also be exceeded
occasionally, regardless of how well a laboratory performs. In
those instances when the laboratory can document the cause for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outlier</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> error, culture health or test system
failure), the outlier should be excluded from the future
calculations of the


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> limits. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or more</NUMEX> consecutive tests do not fall
within the control limits, the results must be explained and the
reference toxicant test must be immediately repeated. Actions taken
to correct the problem must be reported.


4.16.5
If the toxicity value from a given test with a reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicant</ENAMEX> fall well outside the expected range for the test
organisms when using the standard dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and other test
conditions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> should investigate sources of
variability, take corrective actions to reduce identified sources
of variability, and perform an additional reference toxicant test
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same month</TIMEX>. Performance should improve with experience,
and the control limits for endpoints that are point estimates
should gradually narrow. However, control limits of ± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2S</ENAMEX> will be
exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of the time by chance alone, regardless of how well a
laboratory performs. Highly proficient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> which develop
very narrow control limits may be unfairly penalized if a test
result which falls just outside the control limits is rejected de
facto. For this reason, the width of the control limits should be
considered in determining whether or not a reference toxicant test
result falls "well" outside the expected range. The width of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> limits may be evaluated by comparing the calculated CV
(i.e., standard deviation / mean) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25</TIMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> most
recent data points to the distribution of laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CVs</ENAMEX> reported
nationally for reference toxicant testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2000b). In determining whether or not a reference toxicant test
result falls "well" outside the expected range, the result also may
be compared with upper and lower bounds for ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3S</TIMEX>, as any result
outside these control limits would be expected to occur by chance
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment Canada</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>). When a result
from a reference toxicant test is outside the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> confidence
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intervals</ENAMEX>, the laboratory must conduct an immediate investigation
to assess the possible causes for the outlier.


4.16.6
Reference toxicant test results
should not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection of
individual effluent or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> tests. Reference toxicant
testing is used for evaluating the health and sensitivity of
organisms over time and for documenting initial and ongoing
laboratory performance. While reference toxicant test results
should not be used as a de facto criterion for test rejection,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">effluent</ENAMEX> and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> test results should be reviewed and
interpreted in the light of reference toxicant test results. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reviewer</ENAMEX> should consider the degree to which the reference toxicant
test result fell outside of control chart limits, the width of the
limits, the direction of the deviation (toward increased test
organism sensitivity or toward decreased test organism
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sensitivity</ENAMEX>), the test conditions of both the effluent test and the
reference toxicant test, and the objective of the test.


4.17
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REFERENCE TOXICANTS</ENAMEX>




4.17.1
Reference toxicants such as sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaCl</ENAMEX>),
potassium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chloride</ENAMEX> (KCl), cadmium chloride (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CdCl2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> sulfate
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CuSO4</NUMEX>), sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecyl sulfate</ENAMEX> (SDS), and potassium dichromate
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">K2Cr2O7</NUMEX>), are suitable for use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES Program</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> programs requiring aquatic toxicity tests. EMSL-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>
plans to release USEPA-certified solutions of cadmium and copper
for use as reference toxicants, through cooperative research and
development agreements with commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, and will continue
to develop additional reference toxicants for future release.
Standard reference materials can be obtained from commercial supply
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, or can be prepared inhouse using reagent grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.
The regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should be consulted before reference
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicant</ENAMEX>(s) are selected and used.


4.18
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECORD KEEPING</ENAMEX>





4.18.1
Proper record keeping is important. A complete file must
be maintained for each individual toxicity test or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of tests
on closely related samples. This file must contain a record of the
sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-of-custody; a copy of the sample log sheet; the
original bench sheets for the test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> responses during the
toxicity test(s); chemical analysis data on the sample(s); detailed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> of the test organisms used in the test(s), such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
source, age, date of receipt, and other pertinent information
relating to their history and health; information on the
calibration of equipment and instruments; test conditions employed;
and results of reference toxicant tests. Laboratory data should be
recorded on a real-time basis to prevent the loss of information or
inadvertent introduction of errors into the record. Original data
sheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory personnel
performing the tests.


4.18.2
The regulatory authority should retain records pertaining
to discharge permits. Permittees are required to retain records
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertaining</ENAMEX> to permit applications and compliance for a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 CFR 122.41</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">j</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)].

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT</ENAMEX>, AND SUPPLIES
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</ENAMEX>


5.1.1
Effluent toxicity tests may be performed in a fixed or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX> must include equipment for rearing
and/or holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Culturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for test organisms
may be desirable in fixed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> which perform large numbers
of tests. Temperature control can be achieved using circulating
water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, heat exchangers, or environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> used
for rearing, holding, acclimating, and testing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> may be
natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> made up from hypersaline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> derived
from natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> made up from reagent grade
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GP2</NUMEX>) or commercial (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FORTY FATHOMS®</ENAMEX> or HW MARINEMIX®)
artificial sea salts when specifically recommended in the method.
Air used for aeration must be free of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vapors</ENAMEX>.
Oil-free air pumps should be used where possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Particulates</ENAMEX> can
be removed from the air using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALSTON® Grade BX</ENAMEX> or equivalent
filters, and oil and other organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vapors</ENAMEX> can be removed using
activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> filters (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALSTON®</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-1</ENAMEX> filter, or
equivalent).


5.1.2
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> must be well ventilated and free of fumes.
Laboratory ventilation systems should be checked to ensure that
return air from chemistry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> and/or sample handling areas
is not circulated to test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> culture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> or toxicity test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rooms</ENAMEX>, or that air from toxicity test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> does not contaminate
culture areas. Sample preparation, culturing, and toxicity testing
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> should be separated to avoid cross-contamination of cultures
or toxicity test solutions with toxic fumes. Air pressure
differentials between such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> should not result in a net flow of
potentially contaminated air to sensitive areas through open or
loosely-fitting doors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organisms</ENAMEX> should be shielded from external
disturbances.


5.1.3
Materials used for exposure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>, tubing, etc., which
come in contact with the effluent and dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, should be
carefully chosen. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tempered glass</ENAMEX> and perfluorocarbon plastics
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEFLON®</ENAMEX>) should be used whenever possible to minimize sorption and
leaching of toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>. These materials may be reused
following decontamination. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Containers</ENAMEX> made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX>, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polypropylene</ENAMEX>, polyvinyl chloride, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TYGON®</ENAMEX>, etc., may
be used as test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> or to ship, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, and transfer effluents
and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, but they should not be reused unless
absolutely necessary, because they might carry over adsorbed
toxicants from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test to another, if reused. However, these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX> may be repeatedly reused for storing uncontaminated
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> such as deionized or laboratory-prepared dilution waters and
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. Glass or disposable polystyrene containers can be
used as test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>. The use of large (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L</ENAMEX>) glass carboys is
discouraged for safety reasons.


5.1.4
New plastic products of a type not previously used should
be tested for toxicity before initial use by exposing the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the test system where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> is used. Equipment
(pumps, valves, etc.) which cannot be discarded after each use
because of cost, must be decontaminated according to the cleaning
procedures listed below (see Section 5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities, Equipment</ENAMEX>, and
Supplies, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 5.3.2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiberglass</ENAMEX>, in addition to the
previously mentioned materials, can be used for holding,
acclimating, and dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, and in the water
delivery system, but once contaminated with pollutants the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fiberglass</ENAMEX> should not be reused. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> should be flushed or
rinsed thoroughly with the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> before using in the
test.


5.1.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX>, galvanized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>, brass, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lead</ENAMEX> must
not come in contact with culturing, holding, acclimation, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>, or with effluent samples and test solutions. Some
materials, such as several types of neoprene rubber (commonly used
for stoppers) may be toxic and should be tested before
use.


5.1.6
Silicone adhesive used to construct glass test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6.1 TEST SPECIES</ENAMEX>


6.1.1
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> used in characterizing the chronic toxicity
of effluents and/or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> will depend on the
requirements of the regulatory authority and the objectives of the
test. It is essential that good quality test organisms be readily
available throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> from inhouse or commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to
meet NPDES monitoring requirements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> used in toxicity
tests must be identified to species. If there is any doubt as to
the identity of the test organisms, representative specimens should
be sent to a taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> to confirm the
identification.


6.1.2
Toxicity test conditions and culture methods for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Subsection</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.3</NUMEX> are provided in this manual
(also, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002a</TIMEX>).


6.1.3
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> used in the short-term tests described in
this manual are the sheepshead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyprinodon</ENAMEX> variegatus; the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inland</ENAMEX> silverside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menidia</ENAMEX> beryllina; the mysid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysidopsis</ENAMEX> bahia;
the sea urchin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arbacia</ENAMEX> punctulata; and the red macroalga, Champia
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parvula</ENAMEX>.


6.1.4
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have developed culturing and testing methods
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">indigenous species</ENAMEX> that may be as sensitive or more sensitive,
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> recommended in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Subsection</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.3</NUMEX>. However, USEPA
allows the use of indigenous species only where state regulations
require their use or prohibit importation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in
Subsection <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1.3</NUMEX>. Where state regulations prohibit importation of
non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native</ENAMEX> fishes or use of the recommended test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
permission must be requested from the appropriate state agency
prior to their use.


6.1.5
Where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have developed culturing and testing methods
for indigenous species other than those recommended in this manual,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> comparing the sensitivity of the substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and one or
more of the recommended species must be obtained in side-by-side
toxicity tests with reference toxicants and/or effluents, to ensure
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> selected are at least as sensitive as the
recommended species. These data must be submitted to the permitting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Region</ENAMEX>) if required. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> acknowledges that
reference toxicants prepared from pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> may not always be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of effluents. However, because of the observed
and/or potential variability in the quality and toxicity of
effluents, it is not possible to specify a representative
effluent.



6.1.6
Guidance for the selection of test
organisms where the salinity of the effluent and/or receiving water
requires special consideration is provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Support</ENAMEX>
Document for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Quality</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toxics Control</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
1991a).



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Where the salinity of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1</NUMEX>,
freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are used regardless of the salinity of the
effluent.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Where the salinity of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX>, the
choice of organisms depends on state water quality standards and/or
permit requirements.




6.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SOURCES OF TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




6.2.1
The test organisms recommended in this manual can be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultured</ENAMEX> in the laboratory using culturing and handling methods for
each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> described in the respective test method sections.
Also, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2002a</NUMEX>).


6.2.2
Inhouse cultures should be established wherever it is
cost effective. If inhouse cultures cannot be maintained or it is
not cost effective, test organisms should be purchased from
experienced commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993b</TIMEX>).


6.2.3
Sheepshead minnows, inland silversides, mysids, and sea
urchins may be purchased from commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>. However, some
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (e.g., adult sheepshead minnows or adult inland
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silversides</ENAMEX>) may not always be available from commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>
and may have to be collected in the field and brought back to the
laboratory for spawning to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and larvae.


6.2.4
If, because of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, there is any uncertainty
concerning the identity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, it is advisable to have
them examined by a taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> to confirm their
identification. For detailed guidance on identification, see the
individual toxicity test methods.


6.2.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERAL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">NATURAL OCCURRING, WILD CAUGHT</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>


6.2.5.1 The use of test organisms taken from the receiving water
has strong appeal, and would seem to be the logical approach.
However, it is generally impractical and not recommended for the
following reasons:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sensitive organisms</ENAMEX> may not be present in the receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> because of previous exposure to the effluent or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
It is often difficult to collect organisms of the
required age and quality from the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> require collection permits, which may be
difficult to obtain. Therefore, it is usually more cost effective
to culture the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or obtain them from
private, state, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Fish such as sheepshead minnows
and silversides, and invertebrates such as mysids, are easily
reared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or purchased.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
The required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QA/QC</ENAMEX> records, such as the single-laboratory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> data, would not be available.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
Since it is mandatory that the identity of test organisms
is known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> level, it would be necessary to examine
each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> caught in the wild to confirm its identity, which
would usually be impractical or, at the least, very stressful to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
Test organisms obtained from the wild must be observed in
the laboratory for a minimum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> prior to use, to ensure
that they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial infections
and other adverse effects. Fish captured by electroshocking must
not be used in toxicity testing.




6.2.5.2
Guidelines for collection of natural occurring organisms
are provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1990a</NUMEX>); and USEPA
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1993b</NUMEX>).


6.2.6
Regardless of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, test organisms should be
carefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stress
and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and in good physical condition. Some species of test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>, can be obtained from stocks certified as
"disease-free."


6.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIFE STAGE</ENAMEX>




6.3.1
Young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are often more sensitive to toxicants
than are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. For this reason, the use of early life stages,
such as juvenile <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mysids</ENAMEX> and larval <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, is required for all tests.
In a given test, all organisms should be approximately the same age
and should be taken from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> may affect the
results of the tests, it would enhance the value and comparability
of the data if the same species in the same life stages were used
throughout a monitoring program at a given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.


6.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LABORATORY CULTURING</ENAMEX>




6.4.1
Instructions for culturing and/or holding the recommended
test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are included in specified test methods (also, see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002a</TIMEX>).


6.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HOLDING AND HANDLING TEST ORGANISMS</ENAMEX>




6.5.1
Test organisms should not be subjected to changes of more
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3°C</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> temperature or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3‰</NUMEX> in salinity in any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> h
period.


6.5.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organisms</ENAMEX> should be handled as little as possible. When
handling is necessary, it should be done as gently, carefully, and
quickly as possible to minimize stress. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> that are dropped
or touch dry surfaces or are injured during handling must be
discarded. Dipnets are best for handling larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nets</ENAMEX> are commercially available or can be made from small-mesh
nylon netting, silk bolting cloth, plankton netting, or similar
material. Wide-bore, smooth glass tubes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 8</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>) with rubber
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> or pipettors (such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROPIPETTE®</ENAMEX> or other pipettor) should
be used for transferring smaller organisms such as mysids, and
larval <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.


6.5.3
Holding tanks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are supplied with a good quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (see Section 5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities, Equipment</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplies</ENAMEX>) with a
flow-through rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tank</ENAMEX>-volumes per day. Otherwise,
use a recirculation system where the water flows through an
activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> or undergravel filter to remove dissolved
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metabolites</ENAMEX>. Culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can also be piped through high intensity
ultraviolet light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for disinfection, and to photo-degrade
dissolved organics.


6.5.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crowding</ENAMEX> should be avoided because it will stress the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and lower the DO concentrations to unacceptable levels.
The DO must be maintained at a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. The</ENAMEX> solubility
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> depends on temperature, salinity, and altitude. Aerate
gently if necessary.


6.5.5
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> should be observed carefully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> for
signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, physical damage, or mortality. Dead and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">abnormal organisms</ENAMEX> should be removed as soon as observed. It is not
uncommon for some fish mortality (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">510%</NUMEX>) to occur during the first
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX> in a holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that refuse to feed
on artificial food and die of starvation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> in the holding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> should generally be fed as in the cultures (see culturing
methods in the respective methods).


6.5.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> should be fed as much as they will eat at least once
a day with live <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine shrimp nauplii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Artemia</ENAMEX>, or frozen adult
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine shrimp</ENAMEX> or dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> (frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> should be completely thawed
before use). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Adult brine shrimp</ENAMEX> can be supplemented with
commercially prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TETRAMIN®</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BIORIL® flake food</ENAMEX>,
or equivalent. Excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and fecal material should be removed
from the bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> at least twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siphoning</ENAMEX>.


6.5.7
A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> record of feeding, behavioral observations, and
mortality should be maintained.


6.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRANSPORTATION</ENAMEX> TO THE <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST SITE</ENAMEX>




6.6.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> are transported from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> or supply
laboratory to a remote test site in culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX> in plastic bags or large-mouth screw-cap (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">500 mL</NUMEX>)
plastic bottles in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">styrofoam coolers</ENAMEX>. Adequate DO is maintained by
replacing the air above the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the bags with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> from a
compressed gas cylinder, and sealing the bags. Another method
commonly used to maintain sufficient DO during shipment is to
aerate with an airstone which is supplied from a portable pump. The
DO concentration must not fall below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>


6.6.2
Upon arrival at the test site, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are transferred
to receiving water if receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is to be used as the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>. All but a small volume of the holding water
(<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX>) is removed by siphoning, and replaced slowly
over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 to 15 minute</TIMEX> period with dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. If receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is used as dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, caution must be exercised in
exposing the test organisms to it, because of the possibility that
it might be toxic. For this reason, it is recommended that only
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 10%</NUMEX> of the test organisms be exposed initially to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>. If this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> does not show excessive mortality or
obvious signs of stress in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>, the remainder of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are transferred to the dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


6.6.3
A group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> must not be used for a test if they
appear to be unhealthy, discolored, or otherwise stressed, or if
mortality appears to exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> preceding the test. If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX> fail to meet these criteria, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> must be
discarded and a new group obtained. The mortality may be due to the
presence of toxicity, if receiving


<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is used as dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, rather than a diseased
condition of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. If the acclimation process is
repeated with a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and excessive mortality
occurs, it is recommended that an alternative source of dilution
water be used.


6.6.4
The marine organisms can be used at all concentrations of
effluent by adjusting the salinity of the effluent to salinities
specified for the appropriate species test condition or to the
salinity approximating that of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, by adding
sufficient dry ocean salts, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FORTY FATHOMS®</ENAMEX>, or equivalent,
GP2, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypersaline brine</ENAMEX>.


6.6.5
Saline dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can be prepared with deionized
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or a freshwater such as well <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or a suitable surface
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. If dry ocean salts are used, care must be taken to ensure
that the added salts are completely dissolved and the solution is
aerated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX> before the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are placed in the solutions.
The test organisms should be acclimated in synthetic saline water
prepared with the dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salts</ENAMEX>. Caution: addition of dry ocean salts
to dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> may result in an increase in pH. (The pH of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estuarine</ENAMEX> and coastal saline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> is normally
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>).


6.6.6
All effluent concentrations and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>(s) used in a test should have the same salinity. The change
in salinity upon acclimation at the desired test dilution should
not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6‰</NUMEX>. The required salinities for culturing and toxicity
tests with estuarine and marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are listed in the test

(including controls) should be humanely destroyed and disposed of
in an appropriate manner.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SECTION 7</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DILUTION WATER</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7.1 TYPES OF DILUTION WATER</ENAMEX>
7.1.1 The type of dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> used in effluent toxicity tests
will depend largely on the objectives of the study.


7.1.1.1
If the objective of the test is to estimate the absolute
chronic toxicity of the effluent, a synthetic (standard) dilution
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is used. If the test organisms have been cultured in water
which is different from the test dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of
controls, using culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, should be included in the
test.


7.1.1.2
If the objective of the test is to estimate the chronic
toxicity of the effluent in uncontaminated receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the
test may be conducted using dilution water consisting of a single
grab sample of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (if non-toxic), collected outside
the influence of the outfall, or with other uncontaminated natural
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) or standard dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> having
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> the same salinity as the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seasonal</TIMEX>
variations in the quality of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> may affect effluent
toxicity. Therefore, the salinity of saline receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> samples
should be determined before each use. If the test organisms have
been cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> which is different from the test dilution
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of controls, using culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, should be
included in the test.


7.1.1.3
If the objective of the test is to determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
or mitigating effects of the discharge on already contaminated
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the test is performed using dilution water
consisting of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> collected outside the influence of
the outfall. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of controls, using culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, should
be included in the test.


7.1.2
An acceptable dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is one which is appropriate
for the objectives of the test; supports adequate performance of
the test organisms with respect to survival, growth, reproduction,
or other responses that may be measured in the test (i.e.,
consistently meets test acceptability criteria for control
responses); is consistent in quality; and does not contain
contaminants that could produce toxicity. Receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>,
synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, or synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> adjusted to approximate
receiving water characteristics may be used for dilution provided
that the water meets the above listed qualifications for an
acceptable dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides additional
guidance on selecting appropriate dilution waters.


7.1.3
When dual controls (one control
using culture water and one control using dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>) are used
(see Subsections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1.1.1</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.1.1.3</NUMEX> above), the dilution water
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> should be used to determine test acceptability. It is also
the dilution water control that should be compared to effluent
treatments in the calculation and reporting of test results. The
culture water control should be used to evaluate the
appropriateness of the dilution water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Significant
differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> responses in culture water and
dilution water controls could indicate toxicity in the dilution
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and may suggest an alternative dilution water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. USEPA
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides additional guidance on dual controls.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7.3 USE OF RECEIVING WATER AS DILUTION WATER</ENAMEX>


7.3.1
If the objectives of the test require the use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncontaminated</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> as dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and the receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is uncontaminated, it may be possible to collect a sample of
the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> close to the outfall, but should be away from
or beyond the influence of the effluent. However, if the receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is contaminated, it may be necessary to collect the sample in
an area "remote" from the discharge site, matching as closely as
possible the physical and chemical characteristics of the receiving
water near the outfall.


7.3.2
The sample should be collected immediately prior to the
test, but never more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 h</TIMEX> before the test begins. Except where
it is used within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h</TIMEX>, or in the case where large volumes are
required for flow through tests, the sample should be chilled to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0-6°C</ENAMEX> during or immediately following collection, and maintained at
that temperature prior to use in the test.


7.3.3
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> should collect uncontaminated water
having a salinity as near as possible to the salinity of the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at the discharge site. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX> should be collected at
slack high tide, or within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> after high tide. If there is
reason to suspect contamination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the estuary, it is
advisable to collect uncontaminated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from an adjacent estuary.
At times it may be necessary to collect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at a location closer
to the open sea, where the salinity is relatively high. In such
cases, deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or uncontaminated freshwater is added to the
saline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to dilute it to the required test salinity. Where
necessary, the salinity of a surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can be increased by the
addition of artificial sea salts, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FORTY FATHOMS®</ENAMEX>, HW
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MARINEMIX®</ENAMEX>, or equivalent, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GP2</TIMEX>, a


natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> of higher salinity, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypersaline brine</ENAMEX>.
Instructions for the preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypersaline brine</ENAMEX> by
concentrating natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> are provided below.


7.3.4
Receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> containing debris or indigenous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, that may be confused with or attack the test organisms,
should be filtered through a sieve having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> µm mesh openings prior
to use.


7.3.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HYPERSALINE BRINE</ENAMEX>




7.3.5.1
Hypersaline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> (HSB) has several advantages that make
it desirable for use in toxicity testing. It can be made from any
high quality, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">filtered seawater</ENAMEX> by evaporation, and can be added to
deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to prepare dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, or to effluents or
surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> to increase their salinity.


7.3.5.2
The ideal container for making HSB from natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX>
is one that (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">l</ENAMEX>) has a high surface to volume ratio,


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) is made of a noncorrosive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) is easily
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cleaned</ENAMEX> (fiberglass containers are ideal). Special care should be
used to prevent any toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> from coming in contact with the
seawater being used to generate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX>. If a heater is immersed
directly into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX>, ensure that the heater materials do not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corrode</ENAMEX> or leach any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> that would contaminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> successful method used is a thermostatically controlled heat
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchanger</ENAMEX> made from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiberglass</ENAMEX>. If aeration is used, use only
oil-free air compressors to prevent contamination.


7.3.5.3
Before adding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine generator</ENAMEX>, thoroughly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX> the generator, aeration supply tube, heater, and any other
materials that will be in direct contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX>. A good
quality biodegradable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> should be used, followed by several
thorough deionized water rinses. High quality (and preferably high
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salinity</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> should be filtered to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10</NUMEX> mm before
placing into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine generator</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX> should be collected on an
incoming tide to minimize the possibility of
contamination.


7.3.5.4
The temperature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> is increased slowly to
40°C. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> should be aerated to prevent temperature
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stratification</ENAMEX> and to increase water evaporation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> should
be checked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> (depending on the volume being generated) to
ensure that the salinity does not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</NUMEX> and that the
temperature does not exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40°C</TIMEX>. Additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> may be added
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> to obtain the volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> required.


7.3.5.5
After the required salinity is attained, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSB</ENAMEX> should
be filtered a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">l-µm filter</ENAMEX> and poured directly
into portable containers (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L CUBITAINERS®</ENAMEX> or polycarbonate water
cooler jugs are suitable). The containers should be capped and
labelled with the date the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> was generated and its salinity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Containers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSB</ENAMEX> should be stored in the dark and maintained under
room temperature until used.


7.3.5.6
If a source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSB</ENAMEX> is available, test solutions can be
made by following the directions below. Thoroughly mix together the
deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> before mixing in the effluent.


7.3.5.7
Divide the salinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSB</ENAMEX> by the expected test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salinity</ENAMEX> to determine the proportion of deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX>.
For example, if the salinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100‰</NUMEX> and the test is
to be conducted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> divided by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25‰</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>. The proportion
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> part in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> parts deionized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dechlorinated</ENAMEX> and fully treated. Tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can be dechlorinated by
deionization, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon filtration</ENAMEX>, or the use of sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX>.
Use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> (anhydrous) sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX> will reduce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> mg
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chlorine/L</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>). Following dechlorination, total residual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chlorine</ENAMEX> should not exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX> mg/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> Because of the possible
toxicity of thiosulfate to test organisms, a control lacking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiosulfate</ENAMEX> should be included in toxicity tests utilizing
thiosulfate-dechlorinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


7.4.2
To be adequate for general laboratory use following
dechlorination, the tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is passed through a deionizer and

which can occur where holding times are short, grab samples may
seem preferable because of the ease of collection and the potential
of observing peaks (spikes) in toxicity. However, the sampling
duration of a grab sample is so short that full characterization of
an effluent over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24-h</TIMEX> period would require a prohibitively large
number of separate samples and tests. Collection of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
composite sample, however, may dilute toxicity spikes, and average
the quality of the effluent over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sampling period</TIMEX>. Sampling
recommendations are provided below (also see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2002a).

Details of date, time, location, duration, and procedures
used for effluent sample and dilution water collection should be

8.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFFLUENT SAMPLE TYPES</ENAMEX>


8.2.1 The advantages and disadvantages of effluent grab and
composite samples are listed below:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.2.1.1 GRAB SAMPLES Advantages</ENAMEX>:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Easy to collect; require a minimum of equipment and
on-site time.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Provide a measure of instantaneous toxicity. Toxicity
spikes are not masked by dilution. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Disadvantages:</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Samples are collected over a very short period of time and on
a relatively infrequent basis. The chances of detecting a spike in
toxicity would depend on the frequency of sampling, and the
probability of missing spikes is high.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.2.1.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">COMPOSITE SAMPLES: Advantages:</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
A single effluent sample is collected over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
period.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
The sample is collected over a much longer period of time
than grab samples and contains all toxicity spikes.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Disadvantages:</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sampling</ENAMEX> equipment is more sophisticated and expensive,
and must be placed on-site for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 24</NUMEX> h.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Toxicity spikes may not be detected because they are
masked by dilution with less toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.3 EFFLUENT SAMPLING RECOMMENDATIONS</ENAMEX>


8.3.1
When tests are conducted on-site, test solutions can be
renewed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> with freshly collected samples.


8.3.2
When tests are conducted off-site, a minimum of three
samples are collected. If these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are collected on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Test Days</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 3</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, the first sample would be used for test initiation,
and for test solution renewal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day 2</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sample would be
used for test solution renewal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days 3 and 4</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> sample
would be used for test solution renewal on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days 5, 6</TIMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.


8.3.3
Sufficient sample must be collected to perform the
required toxicity and chemical tests. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-L</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-gal</ENAMEX>) CUBITAINER®
will provide sufficient sample volume for most tests.


8.3.4
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FOLLOWING EFFLUENT SAMPLING METHODS</ENAMEX> ARE
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECOMMENDED</ENAMEX>:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.3.4.1 Continuous Discharges</ENAMEX>


8.3.4.1.1
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> discharge is continuous, a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-h
composite sample is to be taken.


8.3.4.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intermittent Discharges</ENAMEX>




8.3.4.2.1
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> discharge is intermittent, a composite
sample is to be collected for the duration of the discharge but not
more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>.


8.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECEIVING WATER SAMPLING</ENAMEX>




8.4.1
Logistical problems and difficulty in securing sampling
equipment generally preclude the collection of composite receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water samples</ENAMEX> for toxicity tests. Therefore, based on the
requirements of the test, a single grab sample or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> grab
samples of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is collected for use in the
test.


8.4.2
The sampling point is determined by the objectives of the
test. At estuarine and marine sites, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> should be collected at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-depth.


8.4.3
To determine the extent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of toxicity in the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at estuarine and marine effluent sites, receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water samples</ENAMEX> are collected at several distances away from the
discharge. The time required for the effluent-receiving-water
mixture to travel to sampling points away from the effluent, and
the rate and degree of mixing, may be difficult to ascertain.
Therefore, it may not be possible to correlate receiving water
toxicity with effluent toxicity at the discharge point unless a dye
study is performed. The toxicity of receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water samples</ENAMEX> from
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> in the discharge plume can be evaluated using the
same number of test <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and test organisms as used in one
effluent toxicity test with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> effluent dilutions.


8.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLE HANDLING</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRESERVATION, AND SHIPPING</ENAMEX>




8.5.1
Unless the samples are used in an on-site toxicity test
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of collection (or hand delivered to the testing laboratory
for use on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of collection), it is recommended that they be
held at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-6°C until</TIMEX> used to inhibit microbial degradation, chemical
transformations, and loss of highly volatile toxic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>.


8.5.2
Composite samples should be chilled as they are
collected. Grab samples should be chilled immediately following
collection.


8.5.3
If the effluent has been chlorinated, total residual
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> must be measured immediately following sample
collection.


8.5.4
Sample holding time begins when the last grab sample in a
series is taken (i.e., when a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> grab samples are taken
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 24-h</TIMEX> period), or when a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24-h</NUMEX> composite sampling period is
completed. If the data from the samples are to be acceptable for
use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES Program</ENAMEX>, the lapsed time (holding time) from
sample collection to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> use of each grab or composite sample
must not exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h. EPA</ENAMEX> believes that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> h is adequate time to
deliver the sample to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> performing the test in most
cases. In the isolated cases, where the permittee can document that
this delivery time cannot be met, the permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> can
allow an option for on-site testing or a variance for an extension
of shipped sample holding time. The request for a variance in
sample holding time, directed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA Regional Administrator</ENAMEX>
under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 CFR 136.3</NUMEX>(e), should include supportive data which show
that the toxicity of the effluent sample is not reduced (e.g.,
because of volatilization and/or sorption of toxics on the sample
container surfaces) by extending the holding time beyond more than
36 h. However, in no case should more than 72 h elapse between
collection and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> use of the sample. In static-renewal tests,
each grab or composite sample may also be used to prepare test
solutions for renewal at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> h and/or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h after first</TIMEX> use, if
stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-6°C</TIMEX>, with minimum head space, as described in
Subsection <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX>. If shipping problems (e.g., unsuccessful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saturday</ENAMEX>
delivery) are encountered with renewal samples after a test has
been initiated, the permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> may allow the continued
use of the most recently used sample for test renewal. Guidance for
determining the persistence of the sample is provided in Subsection
8.7.


8.5.5
To minimize the loss of toxicity due to volatilization of
toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>, all sample containers should be "completely"
filled, leaving no air space between the contents and the
lid.


8.5.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAMPLES USED</ENAMEX> IN ON-SITE TESTS




8.5.6.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samples</ENAMEX> collected for on-site tests should be used within
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 h.</TIMEX>


8.5.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">SAMPLES SHIPPED TO OFF SITE FACILITIES</ENAMEX>




8.5.7.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samples</ENAMEX> collected for off site toxicity testing are to be
chilled to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6°C</NUMEX> during or immediately after collection, and
shipped iced to the performing laboratory. Sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> should be
placed with the sample in the shipping container to ensure that ice
will still be present when the sample arrives at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and
is unpacked. Insulating material should not be placed between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and the sample in the shipping container unless required to
prevent breakage of glass sample containers.


8.5.7.2
Samples may be shipped in one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-L</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l-gal</TIMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUBITAINERS®</ENAMEX> or new plastic "milk" jugs. All sample containers
should be rinsed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> water before being filled with sample.
After use with receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or effluents, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUBITAINERS®</ENAMEX> and
plastic jugs are punctured to prevent reuse.


8.5.7.3
Several sample shipping options are available, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Express Mail</ENAMEX>, air express, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Express Mail</ENAMEX>
is delivered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days a week</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> shipping and
receiving schedules of private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> vary with the
carrier.


8.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAMPLE RECEIVING</ENAMEX>




8.6.1
Upon arrival at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are logged in and
the temperature is measured and recorded. If the samples are not
immediately prepared for testing, they are stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0-6°C</TIMEX> until
used.


8.6.2
Every effort must be made to initiate the test with an
effluent sample on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of arrival in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and the
sample holding time should not exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> h unless a variance has
been granted by the NPDES permitting authority.


8.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PERSISTENCE OF EFFLUENT TOXICITY DURING SAMPLE SHIPMENT</ENAMEX>
AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOLDING</ENAMEX>




8.7.1
The persistence of the toxicity of
an effluent prior to its use in a toxicity test is of interest in
assessing the validity of toxicity test data, and in determining
the possible effects of allowing an extension of the holding time.
Where a variance in holding time (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 36</NUMEX> h, but <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"># 72</NUMEX> h) is
requested by a permittee (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See Subsection</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.5.4</NUMEX>), information on the
effects of the extension in holding time on the toxicity of the
samples must be obtained by comparing the results of
multi-concentration chronic toxicity tests performed on effluent
samples held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> h with toxicity test results using the same samples
after they were held for the requested, longer period. The portion
of the sample set aside for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> test must be held under the
same conditions as during shipment and holding.


8.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PREPARATION OF EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLES FOR</ENAMEX>
TOXICITY TESTS




8.8.1
Adjust the sample salinity to the level appropriate for
objectives of the study using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypersaline brine</ENAMEX> or artificial sea
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salts</ENAMEX>.


8.8.2
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliquots</ENAMEX> are removed from the sample container, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> space above the remaining sample should be held to a minimum.
Air which enters a container upon removal of sample should be
expelled by compressing the container before reclosing, if possible
(i.e., where a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CUBITAINER®</ENAMEX> used), or by using an appropriate
discharge valve (spigot).


8.8.3
It may be necessary to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> coarse-filter samples
through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYLON®</ENAMEX> sieve having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 4</NUMEX> mm mesh openings to remove
debris and/or break up large floating or suspended solids. If
samples contain indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that may attack or be confused
with the test organisms, the samples should be filtered through a
sieve with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-µm mesh openings. Since filtering may increase the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dissolved oxygen</ENAMEX> (DO) in an effluent, the DO should be checked both
before and after filtering. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations
will indicate a potential problem in performing the test. Caution:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">filtration</ENAMEX> may remove some toxicity.


8.8.4
If the samples must be warmed to bring them to the
prescribed test temperature, supersaturation of the dissolved
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and nitrogen may become a problem. To avoid this problem,
samples may be warmed slowly in open test containers. If DO is
still <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above 100%</NUMEX> saturation, based on temperature and salinity
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), after warming to test temperature, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> should be
aerated moderately (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 mL/min</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>
using an airstone. If DO is below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> mg<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> must be
aerated moderately (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 mL/min</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>,
using an airstone, until the DO is within the prescribed range ($
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.0 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX>). Caution: avoid excessive aeration.




8.8.4.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeration</ENAMEX> during the test may alter the results and should
be used only as a last resort to maintain the required DO. Aeration
can reduce the apparent toxicity of the test solutions by stripping
them of highly volatile toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, or increase their
toxicity by altering the pH. However, the DO in the test solution
should not be permitted to fall below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>


8.8.4.2
In static tests (non-renewal or renewal) low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOs</ENAMEX> may
commonly occur in the higher concentrations of wastewater. Aeration
is accomplished by bubbling air through a pipet at the rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bubbles/min.</ENAMEX> If aeration is necessary, all test solutions must be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aerated</ENAMEX>. It is advisable to monitor the DO closely during the first
few <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of the test. Samples with a potential DO problem
generally show a downward trend in DO within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 to 8 h</TIMEX> after the
test


is started. Unless aeration is initiated during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 h</NUMEX> of
the test, the DO may be exhausted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an unattended period</TIMEX>,
thereby invalidating the test.
8.8.5 At a minimum, pH, conductivity or salinity, and total
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residual chlorine</ENAMEX> are measured in the undiluted effluent or
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and pH and conductivity are measured in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dilution water</ENAMEX>.


8.8.5.1
It is recommended that total alkalinity and total
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hardness</ENAMEX> also be measured in the undiluted effluent test water and
the dilution <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


8.8.6
Total ammonia is measured in effluent and receiving water
samples where toxicity may be contributed by unionized ammonia
(i.e., where total ammonia <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 5 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX>). The concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>) of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unionized</ENAMEX> (free) ammonia in a sample is a function of temperature
and pH, and is calculated using the percentage value obtained from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, under the appropriate pH and temperature, and multiplying
it by the concentration (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">mg</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>) of total ammonia in the
sample.


8.8.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Effluents</ENAMEX> and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> can be dechlorinated using
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.7 mg</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> anhydrous sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thiosulfate</ENAMEX> to reduce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/L chlorine
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>). Note that the amount of thiosulfate required to
dechlorinate effluents is greater than the amount needed to
dechlorinate tap <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 7, Dilution Water</ENAMEX>). Since
thiosulfate may contribute to sample toxicity, a thiosulfate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> should be used in the test in addition to the normal
dilution water control.


8.8.8
The DO concentration in the samples should be near
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saturation</ENAMEX> prior to use. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeration</ENAMEX> will bring the DO and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX>
into equilibrium with air, minimize oxygen demand, and stabilize
the pH. However, aeration during collection, transfer, and
preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> should be minimized to reduce the loss of
volatile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.


8.8.9
Mortality or impairment of growth or reproduction due to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pH</ENAMEX> alone may occur if the pH of the sample falls outside the range
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.0</NUMEX>. Thus, the presence of other forms of toxicity (metals
and organics) in the sample may be masked by the toxic effects of
low or high pH. The question about the presence of other toxicants
can be answered only by performing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parallel tests, one with an
adjusted pH, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> without an adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pH. Freshwater samples</ENAMEX> are
adjusted to pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>, and marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are adjusted to pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>, by
adding 1N <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NaOH</ENAMEX> or 1N <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX> dropwise, as required, being careful to
avoid overadjustment.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8.9 PRELIMINARY TOXICITY RANGE-FINDING</ENAMEX>
TESTS


8.9.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA Regional</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> generally have
observed that it is not necessary to conduct a toxicity
range-finding test prior to initiating a static, chronic,
definitive toxicity test. However, when preparing to perform a
static test with a sample of completely unknown quality, or before
initiating a flow-through test, it is advisable to conduct a
preliminary toxicity range-finding test.


8.9.2
A toxicity range-finding test ordinarily consists of a
down-scaled, abbreviated static acute test in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are exposed to several widely-spaced sample dilutions in
a logarithmic series, such as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.0%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.00%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.100%</NUMEX>, and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8-24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h. Caution</ENAMEX>: if the sample must also be used for
the fullscale definitive test, the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36-h</NUMEX> limit on holding time (see
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 8.5.4</NUMEX>) must not be exceeded before the definitive test
is initiated.


8.9.3
It should be noted that the toxicity (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LC50</NUMEX>) of a sample
observed in a range-finding test may be significantly different
from the toxicity observed in the follow-up, chronic, definitive
test because: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the definitive test is longer; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the test
may be performed with a sample collected at a different time, and
possibly differing significantly in the level of
toxicity.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MULTICONCENTRATION</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEFINITIVE</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFFLUENT TOXICITY</ENAMEX> TESTS


8.10.1
The tests recommended for use in determining discharge
permit compliance in the NPDES program are multiconcentration, or
definitive, tests which provide (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a point estimate of effluent
toxicity in terms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an IC25</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IC50</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50</TIMEX>, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a
no-observed-effect-concentration (NOEC) defined in terms of
mortality, growth, reproduction, and/or teratogenicity and obtained
by hypothesis testing. The tests may be static renewal or static
non-renewal.


8.10.2
The tests consist of a control and a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
effluent concentrations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">USEPA</ENAMEX> recommends the use of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.5</NUMEX>
dilution factor for selecting effluent test concentrations.
Effluent test concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.25%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
are commonly used, however, test concentrations should be selected
independently for each test based on the objective of the study,
the expected range of toxicity, the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> concentration,
and any available historical testing information on the effluent.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides additional guidance on choosing appropriate
test concentrations.


8.10.3
When these tests are used in
determining compliance with permit limits, effluent test
concentrations should be selected to bracket the receiving water
concentration. This may be achieved by selecting effluent test
concentrations in the following manner: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> effluent, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) [RWC
+ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>]<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">RWC/4</NUMEX>. For example, where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, appropriate effluent concentrations may be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX>.


8.10.4
If acute/chronic ratios are to be determined by
simultaneous acute and short-term chronic tests with a single
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, using the same sample, both types of tests must use the
same test conditions, i.e., pH, temperature, water hardness,
salinity, etc.


8.11
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RECEIVING WATER</ENAMEX> TESTS




8.11.1
Receiving water toxicity tests generally consist of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and a control. The total salinity of the control
should be comparable to the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.


8.11.2
The data from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatments are analyzed by
hypothesis testing to determine if test organism survival in the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> differs significantly from the control. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> per replicate are required for each
treatment (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Summary of Test Conditions and Test</ENAMEX> Acceptability
Criteria in the specific test method).


8.11.3
In cases where the objective of the test is to estimate
the degree of toxicity of the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, a definitive,
multiconcentration test is performed by preparing dilutions of the
receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, using a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$0.5</NUMEX> dilution series, with a suitable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CHRONIC TOXICITY TEST</ENAMEX> ENDPOINTS AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DATA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX> ENDPOINTS
9.1.1 The objective of chronic aquatic toxicity tests with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effluents</ENAMEX> and pure compounds is to estimate the highest "safe" or
"no-effect concentration" of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>. For practical
reasons, the responses observed in these tests are usually limited
to hatchability, gross morphological abnormalities, survival,
growth, and reproduction, and the results of the tests are usually
expressed in terms of the highest toxicant concentration that has
no statistically significant observed effect on these responses,
when compared to the controls. The terms currently used to define
the endpoints employed in the rapid, chronic and sub-chronic
toxicity tests have been derived from the terms previously used for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> life-cycle tests. As shorter chronic tests were developed, it
became common practice to apply the same terminology to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX>. The terms used in this manual are as follows:


9.1.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safe Concentration</ENAMEX> - The highest concentration of
toxicant that will permit normal propagation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and other
aquatic life in receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. The concept of a "safe
concentration" is a biological concept, whereas the
"no-observed-effect concentration" (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">below</NUMEX>) is a statistically
defined concentration.


9.1.1.2
No<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">-Observed-Effect-Concentration</ENAMEX> (NOEC) - The highest
concentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> or partial life-cycle (short-term) test, that causes no
observable adverse effects on the test organisms (i.e., the highest
concentration of toxicant in which the values for the observed
responses are not statistically significantly different from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controls</ENAMEX>). This value is used, along with other factors, to
determine toxicity limits in permits.


9.1.1.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lowest-Observed-Effect-Concentration</ENAMEX> (LOEC) - The lowest
concentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> or partial life-cycle (short-term) test, which causes
adverse effects on the test organisms (i.e., where the values for
the observed responses are statistically significantly different
from the controls).


9.1.1.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Effective Concentration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>) - A point estimate of the
toxicant concentration that would cause an observable adverse
affect on a quantal, "all or nothing," response (such as death,
immobilization, or serious incapacitation) in a given percent of
the test organisms, calculated by point estimation techniques. If
the observable effect is death or immobility, the term, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lethal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concentration</ENAMEX> (LC), should be used (see <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 9.1.1.5</NUMEX>). A
certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> or LC value might be judged from a biological standpoint
to represent a threshold concentration, or lowest concentration
that would cause an adverse effect on the observed
response.


9.1.1.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lethal Concentration</ENAMEX> (LC) - The
toxicant concentration that would cause death in a given percent of
the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> when the observable adverse
effect is death. For example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LC50</TIMEX> is the concentration of
toxicant that would cause death in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.


9.1.1.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inhibition Concentration</ENAMEX> (IC) - The toxicant
concentration that would cause a given <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> reduction in a
nonquantal biological measurement for the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. For
example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25</TIMEX> is the concentration of toxicant that would cause
a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> reduction in mean young per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> or in growth for the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC50</TIMEX> is the concentration of toxicant that
would cause a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> reduction in the mean population
responses.


9.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENDPOINTS DETERMINED BY</ENAMEX> HYPOTHESIS
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TESTING AND POINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES</ENAMEX>


9.2.1 If the objective of chronic aquatic toxicity tests with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">effluents</ENAMEX> and pure compounds is to estimate the highest "safe or
no-effect concentration" of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>, it is imperative to
understand how the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">endpoints</ENAMEX> of these tests are related
to the "safe" or "no-effect" concentration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOECs</ENAMEX> are
determined by hypothesis testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>, a t test with the
Bonferroni adjustment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Many-One Rank Test</ENAMEX>, or the Wilcoxon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rank Sum Test with Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment), whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICs</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECs</ENAMEX> are determined by point estimation techniques (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spearman-Karber Method</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graphical Method</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>). There are
inherent differences between the use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LOEC</ENAMEX> derived from
hypothesis testing to estimate a "safe" concentration, and the use
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, or other point estimates derived from curve
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fitting</ENAMEX>, interpolation, etc.


9.2.2
Most point estimates, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IC</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> are
derived from a mathematical model that assumes a continuous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dose-response</ENAMEX> relationship. By definition, any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IC</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> value
is an estimate of some amount of adverse effect. Thus the
assessment of a "safe" concentration must be made from a biological
standpoint rather than with a statistical test. In this instance,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> must determine some amount of adverse effect that is
deemed to be "safe," in the sense that from a practical biological
viewpoint it will not affect the normal propagation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and
other aquatic life in receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>.


9.2.3
The use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOECs</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, assumes
either (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a continuous dose-response relationship, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a
non-continuous (threshold) model of the dose-response
relationship.




9.2.3.1
In the case of a continuous dose-response relationship,
it is also assumed that adverse effects that are not "statistically
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observable</ENAMEX>" are also not important from a biological standpoint,
since they are not pronounced enough to test as statistically
significant against some measure of the natural variability of the
responses.


9.2.3.2
In the case of non-continuous dose-response
relationships, it is assumed that there exists a true threshold, or
concentration below which there is no adverse effect on aquatic
life, and above which there is an adverse effect. The purpose of
the statistical analysis in this case is to estimate as closely as
possible where that threshold lies.


9.2.3.3
In either case, it is important to realize that the
amount of adverse effect that is statistically observable (LOEC) or
not observable (NOEC) is highly dependent on all aspects of the
experimental design, such as the number of concentrations of
toxicant, number of replicates per concentration, number of
organisms per replicate, and use of randomization. Other factors
that affect the sensitivity of the test include the choice of
statistical analysis, the choice of an alpha level, and the amount
of variability between responses at a given
concentration.


9.2.3.4
Where the assumption of a continuous dose-response
relationship is made, by definition some amount of adverse effect
might be present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>, but is not great enough to be
detected by hypothesis testing.


9.2.3.5
Where the assumption of a noncontinuous dose-response
relationship is made, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> would indeed be an estimate of a
"safe" or "no-effect" concentration if the amount of adverse effect
that appears at the threshold is great enough to test as
statistically significantly different from the controls in the face
of all aspects of the experimental design mentioned above. If,
however, the amount of adverse effect at the threshold were not
great enough to test as statistically different, some amount of
adverse effect might be present at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. In any case, the
estimate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> with hypothesis testing is always dependent on
the aspects of the experimental design mentioned above. For this
reason, the reporting and examination of some measure of the
sensitivity of the test (either the minimum significant difference
or the percent change from the control that this minimum difference
represents) is extremely important.


9.2.4
In summary, the assessment of a "safe" or "no-effect"
concentration cannot be made from the results of statistical
analysis alone, unless (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the assumptions of a strict threshold
model are accepted, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) it is assumed that the amount of
adverse effect present at the threshold is statistically detectable
by hypothesis testing. In this case, estimates obtained from a
statistical analysis are indeed estimates of a "no-effect"
concentration. If the assumptions are not deemed tenable, then
estimates from a statistical analysis can only be used in
conjunction with an assessment from a biological standpoint of what
magnitude of adverse effect constitutes a "safe" concentration. In
this instance, a "safe" concentration is not necessarily a truly
"no-effect" concentration, but rather a concentration at which the
effects are judged to be of no biological significance.


9.2.5
A better understanding of the relationship between
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endpoints</ENAMEX> derived by hypothesis testing (NOECs) and point
estimation techniques (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECs</ENAMEX>) would be very helpful in
choosing methods of data analysis. Norberg-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>) reported
that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IC25s</TIMEX> were comparable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> effluent and
reference toxicant data sets analyzed. The data sets included
short-term chronic toxicity tests for the sea urchin, Arbacia
punctulata, the sheepshead minnow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyprinodon</ENAMEX> variegatus, and the
red macroalga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champia</ENAMEX> parvula. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birge et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>) reported that
LC1s derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Probit Analyses</ENAMEX> of data from short-term
embryo-larval tests with reference toxicants were comparable to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> for several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1988d</NUMEX>) reported that
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IC25s</NUMEX> were comparable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> for a set of daphnia,
Ceriodaphnia dubia chronic tests with a single reference toxicant.
However, the scope of these comparisons was very limited, and
sufficient information is not yet available to establish an overall
relationship between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of endpoints, especially when
derived from effluent toxicity test data.


9.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRECISION</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.3.1</NUMEX> HYPOTHESIS TESTS
9.3.1.1 When hypothesis tests are used to analyze toxicity test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, it is not possible to express precision in terms of a
commonly used statistic. The results of the test are given in terms
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> endpoints, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No-Observed-Effect Concentration</ENAMEX> (NOEC) and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lowest-Observed-Effect Concentration</ENAMEX> (LOEC). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> and LOEC
are limited to the concentrations selected for the test. The width
of the NOEC-LOEC interval is a function of the dilution series, and
differs greatly depending on whether a dilution factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> is used in the test design. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> recommends the use
of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 0.5</NUMEX> dilution factor (see Section 4, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quality Assurance</ENAMEX>). It
is not possible to place confidence limits on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> and LOEC
derived from a given test, and it is difficult to quantify the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of the NOEC-LOEC endpoints between tests. If the data
from a series of tests performed with the same toxicant, toxicant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, and test <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, were analyzed with hypothesis
tests, precision could only be assessed by a qualitative comparison
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC-LOEC</ENAMEX> intervals, with the understanding that maximum
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> would be attained if all tests yielded the same NOEC-LOEC
interval. In practice, the precision of results of repetitive
chronic tests is considered acceptable if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> vary by no more
than one concentration interval above or below a central tendency.
Using these guidelines, the "normal" range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOECs</ENAMEX> from toxicity
tests using a
0.5 dilution factor (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold difference between adjacent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concentrations</ENAMEX>), would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-fold.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9.3.2 POINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES</ENAMEX>


9.3.2.1
Point estimation techniques have the advantage of
providing a point estimate of the toxicant concentration causing a
given amount of adverse (inhibiting) effect, the precision of which
can be quantitatively assessed (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) within tests by calculation of
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence limits, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) across tests by calculating a
standard deviation and coefficient of variation.


9.3.2.2
It should be noted that software
used to calculate point estimates occasionally may not provide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals. This situation may arise when
test data do not meet specific assumptions required by the
statistical methods, when point estimates are outside of the test
concentration range, and when specific limitations imposed by the
software are encountered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides guidance on
confidence intervals under these circumstances.


9.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DATA ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>


9.4.1 ROLE OF THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATISTICIAN</ENAMEX>
9.4.1.1 The use of the statistical methods described in this
manual for routine data analysis does not require the assistance of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX>. However, the interpretation of the results of the
analysis of the data from any of the toxicity tests described in
this manual can become problematic because of the inherent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> and sometimes unavoidable anomalies in biological data.
If the data appear unusual in any way, or fail to meet the
necessary assumptions, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX> should be consulted. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX>
who are not proficient in statistics are strongly advised to seek
the assistance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX> before selecting the method of
analysis and using any of the results.


9.4.1.2
The statistical methods recommended in this manual are
not the only possible methods of statistical analysis. Many other
methods have been proposed and considered. Certainly there are
other reasonable and defensible methods of statistical analysis for
this kind of toxicity data. Among alternative hypothesis tests
some, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>, require additional assumptions, while
others, like the bootstrap methods, require computerintensive
computations. Alternative point estimations approaches most
probably would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX> to determine
the appropriateness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (goodness of fit), higher order
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> or nonlinear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, confidence intervals for estimates
generated by inverse regression, etc. In addition, point estimation
or regression approaches would require the specification by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> or toxicologists of some low level of adverse effect
that would be deemed acceptable or safe. The statistical methods
contained in this manual have been chosen because they are (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
applicable to most of the different toxicity test data sets for
which they are recommended, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) powerful statistical tests, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
hopefully "easily" understood by nonstatisticians, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) amenable
to use without a computer, if necessary.


9.4.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLOTTING THE DATA</ENAMEX>




9.4.2.1
The data should be plotted, both as a preliminary step to
help detect problems and unsuspected trends or patterns in the
responses, and as an aid in interpretation of the results. Further
discussion and plotted sets of data are included in the methods and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendices</ENAMEX>.


9.4.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DATA TRANSFORMATIONS</ENAMEX>




9.4.3.1
Transformations of the data, (e.g., arc sine square root
and logs), are used where necessary to meet assumptions of the
proposed analyses, such as the requirement for normally distributed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.


9.4.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INDEPENDENCE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RANDOMIZATION</ENAMEX>, AND OUTLIERS




9.4.4.1
Statistical independence among observations is a critical
assumption in all statistical analysis of toxicity data. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
best ways to ensure independence is to properly follow rigorous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomization</ENAMEX> procedures. Randomization techniques should be
employed at the start of the test, including the randomization of
the placement of test organisms in the test <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> and
randomization of the test chamber location within the array of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX>. Discussions of statistical independence, outliers and
randomization, and a sample randomization scheme, are included in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix A.</ENAMEX>


9.4.5
REPLICATION AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SENSITIVITY</ENAMEX>




9.4.5.1
The number of replicates employed for each toxicant
concentration is an important factor in determining the sensitivity
of chronic toxicity tests. Test sensitivity generally increases as
the number of replicates is increased, but the point of diminishing
returns in sensitivity may be reached rather quickly. The level of
sensitivity required by a hypothesis test or the confidence
interval for a point estimate will determine the number of
replicates, and should be based on the objectives for obtaining the
toxicity data.


9.4.5.2
In a statistical analysis of toxicity data, the choice of
a particular analysis and the ability to detect departures from the
assumptions of the analysis, such as the normal distribution of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and homogeneity of variance, is also dependent on the number
of replicates. More than the minimum number of replicates may be
required in situations where it is imperative to obtain optimal
statistical results, such as with tests used in enforcement cases
or when it is not possible to repeat the tests. For example, when
the data are analyzed by hypothesis testing, the nonparametric
alternatives cannot be used unless there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX>
replicates at each toxicant concentration.


9.4.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RECOMMENDED ALPHA LEVELS</ENAMEX>




9.4.6.1
The data analysis examples included in the manual specify
an alpha level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX> for testing the assumptions of hypothesis
tests and an alpha level of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX> for the hypothesis tests
themselves. These levels are common and well accepted levels for
this type of analysis and are presented as a recommended minimum
significance level for toxicity data analysis.


9.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHOICE OF ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>




9.5.1
The recommended statistical analysis of most data from
chronic toxicity tests with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">aquatic organisms</ENAMEX> follows a decision
process illustrated in the flowchart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. An initial
decision is made to use point estimation techniques (the Probit
Analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spearman-Karber Method</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trimmed Spearman</ENAMEX>-Karber
Method, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graphical Method</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>)
and/or to use hypothesis testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>, the t test with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX>, or Wilcoxon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rank Sum Test</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment). NOTE: For the NPDES
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Permit Program</ENAMEX>, the point estimation techniques are the preferred
statistical methods in calculating end points for effluent toxicity
tests. If hypothesis testing is chosen, subsequent decisions are
made on the appropriate procedure for a given set of data,
depending on the results of tests of assumptions, as illustrated in
the flowchart. A specific flow chart is included in the analysis
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> for each test.


9.5.2
Since a single chronic toxicity test might yield
information on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than one parameter</NUMEX> (such as survival, growth,
and reproduction), the lowest estimate of a "no-observed-effect
concentration" for any of the responses would be used as the "no
observed effect concentration" for each test. It follows logically
that in the statistical analysis of the data, concentrations that
had a significant toxic effect on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the observed responses
would not be subsequently tested for an effect on some other
response. This is one reason for excluding concentrations that have
shown a statistically significant reduction in survival from a
subsequent hypothesis test for effects on another parameter such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reason is that the exclusion of such
concentrations usually results in a more powerful and appropriate
statistical analysis. In performing the point estimation techniques
recommended in this manual, an all-data approach is used. For
example, data from concentrations above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> for survival are
included in determining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICp</ENAMEX> estimates using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>.


9.5.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS OF GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION DATA</ENAMEX>




9.5.3.1
Growth data from the sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon
variegatus, and inland silverside, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menidia</ENAMEX> beryllina, larval
survival and growth tests, and the mysid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysidopsis</ENAMEX> bahia,
survival, growth, and fecundity test, are analyzed using hypothesis
testing according to the flowchart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The above mentioned
growth data may also be analyzed by generating a point estimate
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from effluent
concentrations that have tested significantly different from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for survival are excluded from further hypothesis tests
concerning growth effects. Growth is defined as the change in dry
weight of the orginal number of test organisms when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> weights
are obtained. When analyzing the data using point estimating
techniques, data from all concentrations are included in the
analysis.


9.5.3.2
Fecundity data from the mysid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysidopsis</ENAMEX> bahia, test may
be analyzed using hypothesis testing after an arc sine
transformation according to the flowchart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The
fecundity data from the mysid test may also be analyzed by
generating a point estimate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> Interpolation
Method.


9.5.3.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproduction</ENAMEX> data from the red macroalga, Champia
parvula, test are analyzed using hypothesis testing as illustrated
in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The reproduction data from the red macroalga test may
also be analyzed by generating a point estimate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interpolation Method</ENAMEX>.

ANALYSIS OF THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEA URCHIN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARBACIA PUNCTULATA</ENAMEX>,

9.5.4.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from the sea urchin, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arbacia</ENAMEX> punctulata,
fertilization test may be analyzed by hypothesis testing after an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arc sine</ENAMEX> transformation according to the flowchart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The
fertilization data from the sea urchin test may also be analyzed by
generating a point estimate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> Interpolation
Method.


9.5.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS OF MORTALITY DATA</ENAMEX>




9.5.5.1
Mortality data are analyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX>, if
appropriate, or other point estimation techniques, (i.e., the
Spearman-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karber Method</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trimmed Spearman-Karber Method</ENAMEX>, or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphical Method</ENAMEX>) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendices H-K</ENAMEX>) (see discussion below). The
mortality data can also be analyzed by hypothesis testing, after an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arc</ENAMEX> sine square root transformation (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-F</ENAMEX>), according
to the flowchart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.


9.6
HYPOTHESIS TESTS


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.6.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DUNNETT</ENAMEX>'S PROCEDURE


9.6.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure is used to determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. The
procedure consists of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine
the error term, which is then used in a multiple comparison
procedure for comparing each of the treatment means with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> mean, in a series of paired tests (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>). Use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> replicates per
treatment to check the assumptions of the test. In cases where the
numbers of data points (replicates) for each concentration are not
equal, a t test may be performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment for
multiple comparisons (see <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Appendix D</ENAMEX>), instead of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s
Procedure.


9.6.1.2
The assumptions upon which the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure
is contingent are that the observations within treatments are
normally distributed, with homogeneity of variance. Before
analyzing the data, these assumptions must be tested using the
procedures provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix B.</ENAMEX>


9.6.1.3
If, after suitable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">transformations</ENAMEX> have been carried out,
the normality assumptions have not been met, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX>
Test should be used if there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or more data points
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">replicates</NUMEX>) per toxicant concentration. If the numbers of data
points for each toxicant concentration are not equal, the Wilcoxon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rank Sum Test</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment should be used (see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>).


9.6.1.4
Some indication of the sensitivity of the analysis should
be provided by calculating (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the minimum difference between means
that can be detected as statistically significant, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
percent change from the control mean that this minimum difference
represents for a given test.


9.6.1.5
A step-by-step example of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure
is provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix C.</ENAMEX>


9.6.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T TEST WITH</ENAMEX> THE BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENT




9.6.2.1
The t test with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment is used as an
alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure when the number of replicates is
not the same for all concentrations. This test sets an upper bound
of alpha on the overall error rate, in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s
Procedure, for which the overall error rate is fixed at alpha.
Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure is a more powerful test.


9.6.2.2
The assumptions upon which the use of the t test with the
Bonferroni adjustment is contingent are that the observations
within treatments are normally distributed, with homogeneity of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>. These assumptions must be tested using the procedures
provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix B.</ENAMEX>


9.6.2.3
The estimate of the safe concentration derived from this
test is reported in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. A step-by-step example of
the use of a t-test with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment is provided in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix D.</ENAMEX>


9.6.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEEL</ENAMEX>'S MANY-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ONE RANK TEST</ENAMEX>




9.6.3.1
Steel's Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX> is a multiple comparison
procedure for comparing several treatments with a control. This
method is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s procedure, except that it is not
necessary to meet the assumption of normality. The data are ranked,
and the analysis is performed on the ranks rather than on the data
themselves. If the data are normally or nearly normally
distributed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s Procedure would be more sensitive (would
detect smaller differences between the treatments and control). For
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that are not normally distributed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank Test</ENAMEX>
can be much more efficient (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehmann</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>).


9.6.3.2
It is necessary to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> replicates per
toxicant concentration to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s test. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s
procedure, the sensitivity of this test cannot be stated in terms
of the minimum difference between treatment means and the control
mean that can be detected as statistically significant.


9.6.3.3
The estimate of the safe concentration is reported as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. A step-by-step example of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s Many-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank</ENAMEX>
Test is provided in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix E.</ENAMEX>


9.6.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WILCOXON</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RANK SUM TEST WITH</ENAMEX> THE BONFERRONI
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADJUSTMENT</ENAMEX>




9.6.4.1
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test</ENAMEX> is a nonparametric test for
comparing a treatment with a control. The data are ranked and the
analysis proceeds exactly as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Test</ENAMEX> except that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment for multiple comparisons is used instead of
Steel's tables. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steel</ENAMEX>'s test can be used (i.e., when there are
equal numbers of data points per toxicant concentration), it will
be more powerful (able to detect smaller differences as
statistically significant) than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX>'s adjustment.


9.6.4.2
The estimate of the safe concentration is reported as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX>. A step-by-step example of the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon Rank Sum</ENAMEX>
Test with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonferroni</ENAMEX> adjustment is provided in Appendix
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>


9.6.5
A CAUTION IN THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS TESTING




9.6.5.1
If in the calculation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> by hypothesis testing,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tested concentrations cause statistically significant adverse
effects, but an intermediate concentration did not cause
statistically significant effects, the results should be used with
extreme caution.


9.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.7.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROBIT ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>


9.7.1.1
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> is used to estimate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an LC1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LC50</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">EC1</TIMEX>, or
EC50 and the associated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval. The analysis
consists of adjusting the data for mortality in the control, and
then using a maximum likelihood technique to estimate the
parameters of the underlying log tolerance distribution, which is
assumed to have a particular shape.


9.7.1.2
The assumption upon which the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> is
contingent is a normal distribution of log tolerances. If the
normality assumption is not met, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> partial
mortalities are not obtained, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> should not be used.
It is important to check the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> to
determine if use of the analysis is appropriate. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX>
test for heterogeneity provides a good test of appropriateness of
the analysis. The computer program (see discussion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix H</ENAMEX>)
checks the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> statistic calculated for the data set against
the tabular value, and provides an error message if the calculated
value exceeds the tabular value.


9.7.1.3
A discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX>, and examples of computer
program input and output, are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix H.</ENAMEX>


9.7.1.4
In cases where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probit Analysis</ENAMEX> is not appropriate, the
LC50 and confidence interval may be estimated by the
Spearman-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karber Method</ENAMEX> (Appendix I) or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trimmed Spearman</ENAMEX>-Karber
Method (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Appendix J</ENAMEX>). If a test results in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> survival and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
mortality in adjacent treatments (all or nothing effect), the LC50
may be estimated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graphical Method</ENAMEX> (Appendix
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>).


9.7.2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINEAR INTERPOLATION METHOD</ENAMEX>




9.7.2.1
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix L</ENAMEX>) is a
procedure to calculate a point estimate of the effluent or other
toxicant concentration [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inhibition Concentration</ENAMEX>, (IC)] that causes
a given <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> reduction (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>, etc.) in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproduction</ENAMEX>, growth, fertilization, or fecundity of the test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The procedure was designed for general applicability in
the analysis of data from short-term chronic toxicity
tests.


9.7.2.2
Use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear Interpolation Method</ENAMEX> is based on the
assumptions that the responses (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) are monotonically non-increasing
(the mean response for each higher concentration is less than or
equal to the mean response for the previous concentration), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
follow a piece-wise linear response function, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) are from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX>, independent, and representative sample of test data. The
assumption for piece-wise linear response cannot be tested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistically</ENAMEX>, and no defined statistical procedure is provided to
test the assumption for monotonicity. Where the observed means are
not strictly monotonic by examination, they are adjusted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smoothing</ENAMEX>. In cases where the responses at the low toxicant
concentrations are much higher than in the controls, the smoothing
process may result in a large upward adjustment in the control
mean.


9.7.2.3
The inability to test the monotonicity and piece wise
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> response assumptions for this method makes it difficult to
assess when the method is, or is not, producing reliable results.
Therefore, the method should be used with caution when the results
of a toxicity test approach an "all or nothing" response from one
concentration to the next in the concentration series, and when it
appears that there is a large deviation from monotonicity. See
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix L</ENAMEX> for a more detailed discussion of the use of this method
and a computer program available for performing
calculations.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10.2 TEST</ENAMEX> REVIEW


10.2.1
Test review is an important part of an overall quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance program</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 4</ENAMEX>) and is necessary for ensuring that
all test results are reported accurately. Test review should be
conducted on each test by both the testing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and the
regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>.


10.2.2
SAMPLING AND HANDLING




10.2.2.1
The collection and handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are reviewed to
verify that the sampling and handling procedures given in Section 8
were followed. Chain-of-custody forms are reviewed to verify that
samples were tested within allowable sample holding times
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 8.5.4</NUMEX>). Any deviations from the procedures given in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 8</ENAMEX> should be documented and described in the data report
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 10.1</NUMEX>).


10.2.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST ACCEPTABILITY CRITERIA</ENAMEX>




10.2.3.1
Test data are reviewed to verify that test acceptability
criteria (TAC) requirements for a valid test have been met. Any
test not meeting the minimum test acceptability criteria is
considered invalid. All invalid tests must be repeated with a newly
collected sample.


10.2.4
TEST CONDITIONS




10.2.4.1
Test conditions are reviewed and compared to the
specifications listed in the summary of test condition tables
provided for each method. Physical and chemical measurements taken
during the test (e.g., temperature, pH, and DO) also are reviewed
and compared to specified ranges. Any deviations from
specifications should be documented and described in the data
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 10.1</NUMEX>).


10.2.4.2
The summary of test condition tables presented for each
method identify test conditions as required or recommended. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WET</ENAMEX>
test data submitted under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NPDES</ENAMEX> permits, all required test
conditions must be met or the test is considered invalid and must
be repeated with a newly collected sample. Deviations from
recommended test conditions must be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis to determine the validity of test results. Deviations from
recommended test conditions may or may not invalidate a test result
depending on the degree of the departure and the objective of the
test. The reviewer should consider the degree of the deviation and
the potential or observed impact of the deviation on the test
result before rejecting or accepting a test result as valid. For
example, if dissolved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> is measured below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> mg<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/L</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> test
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>, the reviewer should consider whether any observed
mortality in that test chamber corresponded with the drop in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dissolved oxygen</ENAMEX>.


10.2.4.3
Whereas slight deviations in test conditions may not
invalidate an individual test result, test condition deviations
that continue to occur frequently in a given laboratory may
indicate the need for improved quality control in that
laboratory.


10.2.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATISTICAL METHODS</ENAMEX>


10.2.5.1 The statistical methods used for analyzing test data
are reviewed to verify that the recommended flowcharts for
statistical analysis were followed. Any deviation from the
recommended flowcharts for selection of statistical methods should
be noted in the data report. Statistical methods other than those
recommended in the statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">flowcharts</ENAMEX> may be appropriate (see
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 9.4.1.2</NUMEX>), however, the laboratory must document the use
of and provide the rationale for the use of any alternate
statistical method. In all cases (flowchart recommended methods or
alternate methods), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> should verify that the necessary
assumptions are met for the statistical method used.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10.2.6 CONCENTRATION-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS</ENAMEX>


10.2.6.1
The concept of a concentration-response, or more
classically, a dose-response relationship is "the most fundamental
and pervasive one in toxicology" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casarett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doull</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>). This
concept assumes that there is a causal relationship between the
dose of a toxicant (or concentration for toxicants in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX>) and
a measured response. A response may be any measurable biochemical
or biological parameter that is correlated with exposure to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicant</ENAMEX>. The classical concentration-response relationship is
depicted as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sigmoidal</ENAMEX> shaped curve, however, the particular shape
of the concentration-response curve may differ for each coupled
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxicant</ENAMEX> and response pair. In general, more severe responses (such
as acute effects) occur at higher concentrations of the toxicant,
and less severe responses (such as chronic effects) occur at lower
concentrations. A single toxicant also may produce multiple
responses, each characterized by a concentration-response
relationship. A corollary of the concentration-response concept is
that every toxicant should exhibit a concentration-response
relationship, given that the appropriate response is measured and
given that the concentration range evaluated is appropriate. Use of
this concept can be helpful in determining whether an effluent
possesses toxicity and in identifying anomalous test
results.


10.2.6.2
The concentration-response relationship generated for
each multi-concentration test must be reviewed to ensure that
calculated test results are interpreted appropriately. USEPA
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2000a</NUMEX>) provides guidance on evaluating concentration-response
relationships to assist in determining the validity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WET</ENAMEX> test
results. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WET</ENAMEX> test results (from multi-concentration tests)
reported under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPDES</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> should be reviewed and reported
according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX> guidance on the evaluation of
concentration-response relationships (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000a</TIMEX>). This guidance
provides review steps for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> different concentration-response
patterns that may be encountered in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">WET</ENAMEX> test data. Based on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, the guidance provides one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> determinations: that
calculated effect concentrations are reliable and should be
reported, that calculated effect concentrations are anomalous and
should be explained, or that the test was inconclusive and the test
should be repeated with a newly collected sample. It should be
noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of a valid concentration-response
relationship is not always clear cut. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from some tests may
suggest consultation with professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toxicologists</ENAMEX> and/or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regulatory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. Tests that exhibit unexpected
concentration-response relationships also may indicate a need for
further investigation and possible retesting.


10.2.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REFERENCE TOXICANT TESTING</ENAMEX>




10.2.7.1
Test review of a given effluent or receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> test
should include review of the associated reference toxicant test and
current control chart. Reference toxicant testing and control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">charting</ENAMEX> is required for documenting the quality of test organisms
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.7</NUMEX>) and ongoing laboratory performance (Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.16</NUMEX>). The reviewer should verify that a quality control reference
toxicant test was conducted according to the specified frequency
required by the permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> or recommended by the method
(e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>). The test acceptability criteria, test conditions,
concentration-response relationship, and test sensitivity of the
reference toxicant test are reviewed to verify that the reference
toxicant test conducted was a valid test. The results of the
reference toxicant test are then plotted on a control chart (see
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Subsection 4.16</NUMEX>) and compared to the current control chart limits
(± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> standard deviations).


10.2.7.2
Reference toxicant tests that fall outside of recommended
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> chart limits are evaluated to determine the validity of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> effluent and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> tests (see Subsection
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.16</NUMEX>). An out of control reference toxicant test result does not
necessarily invalidate associated test results. The reviewer should
consider the degree to which the reference toxicant test result
fell outside of control chart limits, the width of the limits, the
direction of the deviation (toward increasing test organism
sensitivity or toward decreasing test <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism sensitivity</ENAMEX>), the
test conditions of both the effluent test and the reference
toxicant test, and the objective of the test. More frequent and/or
concurrent reference toxicant testing may be advantageous if recent
problems (e.g., invalid tests, reference toxicant test results
outside of control chart limits, reduced health of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures</ENAMEX>, or increased within-test variability) have been
identified in testing.


10.2.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TEST</ENAMEX> VARIABILITY




10.2.8.1
The within-test variability of individual tests should be
reviewed. Excessive within-test variability may invalidate a test
result and warrant retesting. For evaluating within-test
variability, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> should consult <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> guidance on upper and
lower percent minimum significant difference (PMSD) bounds (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2000b).


10.2.8.2
When <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">NPDES</ENAMEX> permits require sublethal hypothesis testing
endpoints from Methods <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1006.0</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1007.0</NUMEX> (e.g., growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOECs</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOECs</ENAMEX>), within-test variability must be reviewed and variability
criteria must be applied as described in this section (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.2.8.2</NUMEX>).
When the methods are used for non-regulatory purposes, the
variability criteria herein are recommended but are not required,
and their use (or the use of alternative variability criteria) may
depend upon the intended uses of the test results and the
requirements of any applicable data quality objectives and quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> plan.




10.2.8.2.1
To measure test variability, calculate the percent
minimum significant difference (PMSD) achieved in the test. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> is the smallest percentage decrease in growth or reproduction
from the control that could be determined as statistically
significant in the test. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> is calculated as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times the
minimum significant difference (MSD) divided by the control mean.
The equation and examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSD</ENAMEX> calculations are shown in Appendix
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. PMSD</ENAMEX> may be calculated legitimately as a descriptive statistic
for within-test variability, even when the hypothesis test is
conducted using a non-parametric method. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds were based
on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of tests, including tests for which a
non-parametric method was required for determining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOEC</ENAMEX>. The conduct of hypothesis testing to determine test results
should follow the statistical flow charts provided for each method.
That is, when test data fail to meet assumptions of normality or
heterogeneity of variance, a non-parametric method (determined
following the statistical flowchart for the method) should be used
to calculate test results, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> may be calculated as
described above (using parametric methods) to provide a measure of
test variability.


10.2.8.2.2
Compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PMSD</ENAMEX> measured in the test with the upper PMSD
bound variability criterion listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. When the test PMSD
exceeds the upper bound, the variability among replicates is
unusually large for the test method. Such a test should be
considered insufficiently sensitive to detect toxic effects on
growth or reproduction of substantial magnitude. A finding of
toxicity at a particular concentration may be regarded as
trustworthy, but a finding of "no toxicity" or "no statistically
significant toxicity" at a particular concentration should not be
regarded as a reliable indication that there is no substantial
toxic effect on growth or reproduction at that
concentration.


10.2.8.2.3
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PMSD</ENAMEX> measured for the test is less than or equal
to the upper PMSD bound variability criterion in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, then the
test's variability measure lies within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal</TIMEX> bounds and the effect
concentration estimate (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or LOEC) would normally be
accepted unless other test review steps raise serious doubts about
its validity.


10.2.8.2.4
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PMSD</ENAMEX> measured for the test exceeds the upper PMSD
bound variability criterion in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, then one of the following
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cases applies (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.2.8.2.4.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.2.8.2.4.2</NUMEX>).




10.2.8.2.4.1
If toxicity is found at the permitted receiving water
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (RWC) based upon the value of the effect
concentration estimate (NOEC or LOEC), then the test shall be
accepted and the effect concentration estimate may be reported,
unless other test review steps raise serious doubts about its
validity.


10.2.8.2.4.2
If toxicity is not found at the permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RWC</ENAMEX> based upon
the value of the effect concentration estimate (NOEC or LOEC) and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PMSD</ENAMEX> measured for the test exceeds the upper PMSD bound, then
the test shall not be accepted, and a new test must be conducted
promptly on a newly collected sample.


10.2.8.2.5
To avoid penalizing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> that achieve unusually
high precision, lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds shall also be applied when a
hypothesis test result (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or LOEC) is reported. Lower PMSD
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bounds</ENAMEX>, which are based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th</TIMEX> percentiles of national PMSD
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10th</NUMEX> percentile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> represents
a practical limit to the sensitivity of the test method because few
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">laboratories</ENAMEX> are able to achieve such precision on a


regular basis and most do not achieve it even occasionally. In
determining hypothesis test results (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOEC</ENAMEX> or LOEC), a test
concentration shall not be considered toxic (i.e., significantly
different from the control) if the relative difference from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> is less than the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>,
2000b for specific examples of implementing lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds.
10.2.8.3 To assist in reviewing within-test variability, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
recommends maintaining control charts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSDs</ENAMEX> calculated for
successive effluent tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USEPA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000b</TIMEX>). A control chart of PMSD
values characterizes the range of variability observed within a
given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and allows comparison of individual test PMSDs
with the laboratory's typical range of variability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> charts
of other variability and test performance measures, such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSD</ENAMEX>, standard deviation or CV of control responses, or average
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> response, also may be useful for reviewing tests and
minimizing variability. The log of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMSD</ENAMEX> will provide an
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> normal variate useful for control charting.

Lower and upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PMSD</ENAMEX> bounds were determined from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th</TIMEX> and
