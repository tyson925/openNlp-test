This report evaluates the engineering and economic factors of
installing air pollution control technologies to meet the
requirements of multipollutant control strategies. The
implementation timing and reduction stringency of such strategies
affect the quantity of resources required to complete the control
technology installations and the ability of markets to adjust and
to provide more resources where needed. Using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Planning Model</ENAMEX> (IPM), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>) estimated the number and size of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that need to
install new emissions control equipment to meet the implementation
dates and emission reductions set forth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>.
This study provides an estimate of the resources required for
the installation of control technologies to obtain emission
reductions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SO2</NUMEX>), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. More innovative control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> and compliance alternatives requiring fewer resources
than those considered for this study are likely to be developed
with the implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. Market based
approaches reward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> for finding cost-effective measures that
exceed emission reduction targets. For example, improved scrubber
performance and the ability of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> to switch to lower sulfur
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acid Rain</ENAMEX> Program were reasons the cost of that
program were less than projected. The development of control
technology alternatives to selective catalytic reduction (SCR)
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX State Implementation Plan</ENAMEX> (SIP) Call is another
example of how alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> may require fewer resources
than the projected approach. In addition to innovative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>, the time allowed for installation of significant
numbers of control technologies is an important factor to consider,
especially for the near future. While it is expected that markets
for the materials and labor used in the construction and operation
of the control technologies will respond to increased demand, this
response will not be instantaneous. It is likely that the strength
of this market response will increase as time progresses. It is
expected that the market would have sufficient time to respond to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phase II</ENAMEX> of the program as the more stringent emission targets for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">phase II</ENAMEX> are set for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>. Even though this analysis looks at the
resource availability beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, these projections are of limited
value as they do not take into account this market response.
However, it is projected that there are sufficient resources
available to complete the projected control technology
installations for phase I by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. It should also be noted that
decreasing the amount of time provided to install control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> to meet a given strategy has the potential to affect
the cost of compliance as this will accelerate their
installation.
The control technologies considered by this report as candidates
to be used for multipollutant control strategies include: limestone
forced oxidation (LSFO) flue gas desulfurization (FGD) for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> for the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX>, and activated carbon
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">injection</ENAMEX> (ACI) for the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>.
Installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSFO</ENAMEX> presents a conservatively high estimate of
anticipated resources and time to provide additional control of SO2
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emission</ENAMEX>, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSFO</ENAMEX> systems commonly are more resource intensive
than many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> technologies. Conservatively high assumptions
were made for the time, labor, reagents, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> needed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">install FGD</ENAMEX> systems. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSFO</ENAMEX> installation timing, it is expected
that one system requires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 27 months</TIMEX> of total effort for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX>, engineering, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, and startup, with connections
occurring during normally scheduled outages. Multiple retrofits at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> would take longer to install (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 36</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> for the
retrofit of three absorbers for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> boilers). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limestone</ENAMEX> is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSFO</ENAMEX> to remove SO2 from the flue gas stream. Steel
is the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hardware component</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems and is used
primarily for the absorber, ductwork, and supports.
Other elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations, such as construction
equipment requirements, are typically modest, particularly given
that systems are installed at the back end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> and
close to the ground. More recently, improvements in technology have
been implemented where space requirements were an issue for
construction and accommodating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system, including fewer and
smaller absorbers and more efficient on-site use and treatment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> and byproducts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> is currently the predominant technology to be used for NOX
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and is also the most demanding in terms of resources and
time to install when compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOx</ENAMEX> control technologies. It
is expected that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 21 months</TIMEX> of total
effort for planning, engineering, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, and startup.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multiple SCR</ENAMEX> systems at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> would take longer to install
(e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 35 months</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCRs</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ammonia</ENAMEX> and urea
are the reagents used along with a catalyst to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOX</ENAMEX> from the
flue gas stream. Experience in installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCRs</ENAMEX> for the NOX SIP Call
has shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> equipment can be installed on the facilities
in the space provided. In some cases, some moving of equipment has
been necessary. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the primary pieces of specialized
construction equipment that can be useful for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations are
tall, heavy-lift cranes, and these appear to be in adequate
supply.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> was presumed to be the technology that would be used to
reduce mercury where dedicated mercury controls were needed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning</ENAMEX>, engineering, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, and start up of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system
is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only about 15 months</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multiple ACI</ENAMEX> systems at any one facility
are assumed to take longer to install (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 16</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> hardware is comprised of relatively common
mechanical components and is largely made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system
requires much less in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, labor, or other resources to
install than either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGD</ENAMEX> or SCR technology. Therefore, the impact of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> hardware on resource demand is much less than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> technologies for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX> or NOX control, respectively.
The resources required for the installation of control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> to achieve the emission reductions under the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX> were estimated and compared to their current market
availability. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, control technology
installations have been looked at for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods between now</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005, 2005 and 2010, 2010 and 2015</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2015 and 2020</TIMEX>. For the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> period, it is assumed that all controls need to be installed
in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31-month period</TIMEX>. This will provide a conservatively high
estimate of the required resources because many of the necessary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> installations have already begun. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other five</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-periods</TIMEX>, it is conservatively estimated that all installations
will be completed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>. However, the estimates
indicate that there is ample steel and general construction labor
to support the installation of these technologies over these time
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX>. As noted above, projections beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> are of limited
value as market conditions could change significantly between now
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> in response both to demand for resources for a
multipollutant program and because of other market factors. Skilled
labor requirements, specifically for boilermakers, were estimated
and have the potential to be the more limiting resource requirement
in phase I of the program. The demand for boilermaker labor due to
the NOX SIP Call over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> is likely to be limiting,
but through the implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, additional
recruiting and training of new boilermakers would create a stronger
market for skilled labor, ultimately increasing the supply.
With regards to reagents and other consumables, it is projected
that there is sufficient supply of limestone for additional FGD
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. It is estimated that there is also enough SCR catalyst
capacity to supply this market. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ammonia</ENAMEX> and urea supply is also
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plentiful</ENAMEX>, although it is expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> reduction will cause a
moderate increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand. Bolstered by the fact that there
is currently a worldwide excess capacity problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> of
these globally traded commodity chemicals, it is projected that
there will be an ample supply of ammonia and urea. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand for
activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> is expected to slightly increase as a result of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. Activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> is traded on a global basis
and there is currently substantial excess capacity that can readily
provide for this increase in demand.

In response to continuing concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX> from electric
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, further reductions of emissions of multiple
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> from electric power sector are being considered. Because
the largest portion of emission reductions are expected to come
from the coal-fired electricity-generating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the electric
power sector, this report considers environmental improvement for
coal-fired electricity generating power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Strategies enabling
the control of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> (multipollutant control
strategies) from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> have recently been receiving
increased attention.
Currently, power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are required to reduce emissions of
nitrogen oxides (NOX) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SO2</NUMEX>). The revisions of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ambient Air Quality Standards</ENAMEX> (NAAQS) aimed at
reducing haze may require electric utility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to adopt
additional control measures. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Environmental</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protection Agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>) has determined that the regulation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> emissions from coal-fired power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> is appropriate and
necessary. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concurrently</ENAMEX>, legislation has been proposed in previous
and current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congresses</ENAMEX> that would require simultaneous reductions
of multiple emissions, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy</ENAMEX>
Policy recommends the establishment of "mandatory reduction targets
for emissions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur dioxide</ENAMEX>, nitrogen
oxides, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s multipollutant proposal, a far reaching
effort to decrease power plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emissions</ENAMEX>, was introduced as the
Clear Skies <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. House of Representatives</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 26</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 28, 2002</TIMEX>. This legislation is
intended to reduce air pollution from electricity generators and
improve air quality throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> is
designed to decrease air pollution by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> through an
emission cap-and-trade program, using a proven, market-based
approach that could save consumers <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX>. The Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX> calls for:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â–  Decreasing SO2</ENAMEX> emissions by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 percent</NUMEX>, from current emissions
of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 million tons</NUMEX> to a cap of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">million tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 million tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â–  Decreasing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOx</ENAMEX> emissions by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67 percent</NUMEX>, from current emissions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 million</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> to a cap of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">million tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX>, and to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.7 million tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>, and â– 
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Decreasing mercury</ENAMEX> emissions by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 percent</NUMEX> by implementing the
first-ever national cap on mercury
emissions. Emissions will be cut from current emissions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> to a cap of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 tons</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</TIMEX>.
Therefore, it is timely to review the engineering and resource
requirements of installing control technologies for multipollutant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> strategies.
This report analyzes the resources required for installing and
operating retrofit control technologies for achieving reductions in
multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> from coal-fired power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. It examines the control technology's hardware, reagents,
availability of the needed construction equipment, time required to
implement at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with single and multiple installation
requirements, and the availability of labor needed for
installation. The control technologies considered in this report
include limestone forced oxidation (LSFO) wet flue gas
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desulfurization</ENAMEX> (FGD), selective catalytic reduction (SCR), and
activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> injection (ACI) for the control of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX>, respectively.
The report is organized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> appendix.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX> provides general background information on emission
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technologies. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX> analyzes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SO2</TIMEX> control technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>
requirements by providing information on control technology's
hardware and reagents, the construction equipment necessary to
install a control technology, time required to implement this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with single and multiple installation
requirements, and the amount of labor needed to install the control
technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chapters 3</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> review, in the same fashion, the
resource requirements of installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> and mercury control
technology, respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX> focuses on synergistic
combinations of control retrofits on a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chapter 6</ENAMEX>
examines the availability of resources necessary for the
installation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX>, and mercury control retrofit technologies
for the timing and emission reductions proposed under the Clear
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Skies Act</ENAMEX>. Conclusions are presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 7</ENAMEX> and references in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 8</ENAMEX>. Appendix A is located at the end of this report. It
provides implementation schedules for single and multiple control
technology installations.

In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, the resource requirements to retrofit FGD
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SO2</ENAMEX> are examined for existing coal-fired electric
utility boilers. The FGD technology most commonly installed in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and worldwide is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSFO</ENAMEX>. Material, labor, and construction
equipment resource estimates presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> are for LSFO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and are a conservative estimate compared to less resource
intensive magnesium enhanced lime (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEL</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lime spray dryer</ENAMEX> (LSD)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>. Typically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MEL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSD</ENAMEX> technologies rely upon
increased reactivity of reagents with flue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and require fewer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>. Advances in FGD technology, design,
materials, and expertise available for retrofit installations made
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> form a sharp contrast to earlier retrofit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Technology to remove <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SO2</ENAMEX> is anticipated to continue along
current trends and rely heavily on wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> and other advanced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>. This chapter examines the experience and issues for
the retrofit installation of LSFO technology.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> focuses on the resources needed for typical or
normally constrained wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSFO</ENAMEX>, retrofit
installations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wet FGD</ENAMEX> retrofit technology generally provides a
conservatively high estimate of most resources. However, it is
likely that other SO2 removal technologies, as well as upgrades or
enhancements to existing FGD systems, will compete in the market
under a multipollutant strategy. Upgrades to existing FGD systems
would include a case-by-case examination of the absorber <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>,
flue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas inlet</ENAMEX>, absorber gas velocity, reagent preparation, upgrade
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pumps</ENAMEX>, and potential changes to some internals, the type of
reagent, and to the chemical processes to increase performance.
Scrubber upgrades were not considered in this analysis in order to
provide a conservative estimate of the resource demand for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multipollutant</ENAMEX> strategy. This is because upgrades to existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrofits</ENAMEX> will generally consume fewer resources than full
retrofits regardless of the technology.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OKN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pÃ³Ã«Ã­Ã‰Ã£=e~ÃªÃ‡Ã¯~ÃªÃ</ENAMEX>‰
The wet FGD process operates by reacting SO2 in the flue gas
with a reagent in an absorber. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems are typically positioned
after the particulate control device. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> retrofits are positioned
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">downstream</ENAMEX>, typically at the back end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, and are not
intrusive to the boiler. Typical configuration is shown in Figure
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-1</ENAMEX>. At the typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corrosive flue gases</ENAMEX> leaving the
particulate control device (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">149- 182 ÂºC</ENAMEX>) are cooled, or quenched,
before entering the main absorber device. Quenching cools and
saturates the flue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> with absorber slurry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quenching</ENAMEX> can occur in
a prescrub area or more commonly an area integral to the absorber.
After quenching, the less corrosive flue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX> entering the
absorber decrease to temperatures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 - 66</NUMEX> ÂºC with pH values
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 5</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX>. Some higher efficiency boilers may have
increased flue gas velocities and can result in corrosive flue gas
"blow through" to the absorber. The chemical reactions that occur
with the limestone reagent form a corrosive environment requiring
many of the system components to be corrosion and abrasion
resistant. The quenching area is typically a highly corrosive
environment and the reagent slurries are highly abrasive. The
handling and processing of the reagent, commonly limestone, is
often done onsite, as is the treatment of the effluent as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX> or
processing into a saleable product (e.g., gypsum handling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX>).

Major wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system components</ENAMEX> are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The
hardware and equipment to support wet FGD technology involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
major systems. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> systems are primarily responsible for the direct
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scrubbing</ENAMEX> and handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flue gases</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> systems are
involved with delivery of reagents, processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> (air,
solids, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>), and the processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> into saleable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">by-products</ENAMEX>. Typically, the greatest hardware requirements involve
the systems for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX> removal, primarily the absorber <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>, and
flue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> handling, particularly ductwork and support <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>. Much of
the equipment for these systems will be unique to the site and
project requirements, although the equipment
specifications may be repeated if multiple absorbers are
involved. Typically an FGD retrofit can use an existing chimney or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stack</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> used in the largest quantity for an FGD retrofit,
aside from reagent, is steel. In general, the amount of structural
steel for a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> retrofit system is equal to or less than
the steel requirements for a SCR retrofit of the same size.1 The
reduced requirement for structural steel is due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> absorber
usually being self-supporting, weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less</NUMEX>, and being installed
closer to the ground. In contrast, a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> is
heavier, elevated, and adjacent to the boiler. The majority of
structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations is dedicated to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ductwork</ENAMEX> and supports. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> may be needed to reinforce
existing steel at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. In addition to structural steel,
additional light, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> may be used in the limestone
preparation area and for the processing of waste or byproducts
(e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern FGD</ENAMEX> systems are more attuned to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corrosive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SO2</ENAMEX> scrubbing environment and therefore increasingly
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utilize fiberglass</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber lined steel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alloys</ENAMEX> in construction.
In addition, because of existence of corrosive zones, preference is
often given to the use of large-sized sheets that minimize
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">welding.2 Large</ENAMEX>-sized sheets are used to fabricate the absorber
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessel</ENAMEX>, the ductwork, and supports. Particularly over the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>, there has been greater availability of plate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> for FGD
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> due to the global sourcing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon steel</ENAMEX>.
Total steel requirements for retrofitting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a typical 500</TIMEX> mega
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watt</ENAMEX>, electric (MWe) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> are in the range of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000 to 1125</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 2.0 and 2.25 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>. This
range assumes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80 percent</NUMEX> of the structural steel is
for ductwork and supports and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> is required for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">miscellaneous steel</ENAMEX> such as reagent conveying equipment, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solids</ENAMEX> handling systems. An assumption of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1125 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> is
a conservatively high estimate since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500</TIMEX> MWe FGD retrofit
installations have been completed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as 250</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">375 tons</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1,3</NUMEX> Often a single absorber
will serve multiple boilers and reduce much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> that would
be required if absorbers had been fed by individual boilers.
Currently, the installed maximum single absorber capacity in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">890</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MWe</ENAMEX> being fed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> boilers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tampa Electric</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Bend</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Station</ENAMEX>. It is likely that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">450 MWe</NUMEX> boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> will use a
common single absorber with commensurate reduction in required
steel from efficiencies gained by common areas. For example, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> system is estimated to use approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2000 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, or
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2.2 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>, rather than a combined maximum of
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2025 tons</NUMEX> for a situation in which the boilers required separate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absorbers</ENAMEX>.
In general, a better understanding of the chemical processes in
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> to maximize mass transfer in a
minimum amount of space<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> More efficient designs can also reduce
the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> needed for the absorber and ductwork. Other
advanced design factors reduce steel requirements, including the
virtual elimination of redundant absorbers, the ability to
down-size absorbers without sacrificing performance (e.g., by
increasing flue gas velocity, advanced placement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray nozzles</ENAMEX>,
enhancing limestone characteristics), and material changes
including wallpapering with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alloys</ENAMEX> and utilizing fiberglass<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> A new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems, pioneered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid to late 1990</TIMEX>'s,
improved mass transfer, which resulted in the usage of more compact

compared to an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> In addition,
typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MEL</ENAMEX> absorber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> need less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> due to the use of
smaller absorbers enabled by shorter residence time requirements
than for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFSO</ENAMEX> systems.==In this report, the estimate of typical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LFSO FGD</ENAMEX> system hardware requirements provides a conservatively
high estimate of installation resources compared to other SO2
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technologies.
The majority of hardware required for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems is commonly
available. Storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, nozzles, and piping for the reagent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">storage</ENAMEX> and delivery system are also common and therefore widely
available. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hardware</ENAMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> includes the flue
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> duct system, limestone storage (including loading and conveyer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>), gypsum dewatering and wastewater treatment, gypsum
storage, piping, valves, pumps and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, electricity supply,
controls, instrumentation, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipe bridges</ENAMEX> and cable channels, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> as needed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems also include
hardware such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inlet fans</ENAMEX>, dampers, absorber internals,
recirculation pumps, and oxidation blowers that are commonly used
in other large industries. Because this hardware is used
extensively throughout industry, availability should not be an
issue, except that supply of this type of equipment needs to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> into the overall project schedule so it does not cause
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bottlenecks</ENAMEX>. Early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems were designed with separate
quenching, or prescrubber, systems to cool the flue gas coming off
the particulate control device. Modern systems take the hot flue
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> directly into the absorber, where quenching occurs. Limestone
and gypsum handling also includes milling, conveying, and
wastewater treatment systems.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wet FGD</ENAMEX> systems require a continuous feed of reagent to remove
SO2. Generally, if pH of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scrubbing liquor</ENAMEX> falls below a range of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>, additional reagent is required to maintain the
reactivity of the absorbent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limestone</ENAMEX> is the most commonly used
reagent, with the quantity of its consumption depending primarily
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal sulfur</ENAMEX> levels. For example, even in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX>
to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> coal
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> levels, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur coal</ENAMEX> can increase consumption
by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third.6</NUMEX> It is not uncommon for modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems to
achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 percent</NUMEX> utilization of limestone<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX> Generally, higher
percent utilization equates to higher reactivity of the reagent,
and, therefore, less reagent is needed to achieve a given level of
SO2 removal. The production of gypsum requires a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX>
percent limestone utilization.
A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> uses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 25-32 tons per hour</NUMEX> of limestone. A
coal with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> sulfur, conservatively, will require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 tons</NUMEX>*
of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">limestone per hour</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.064 tons per MWe per hour</NUMEX>. This
estimate is based on an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> load factor, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,500</NUMEX> Btu/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kWh</NUMEX>,
stoichiometry of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1</NUMEX> for limestone, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX> removal rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX>,
and a minimum purity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CaCO3</TIMEX>. Any enhancement of
the reagent (i.e., magnesium or buffering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>) will reduce the
amount of limestone needed. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MEL sorbent</ENAMEX> consumption for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur coal</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 17-18 tons per hour.6</NUMEX> These estimates
are conservatively high given that recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems are operating
at near stoichiometric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">levels8</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX> are commonly used to
achieve higher SO2 removal, particularly to enhance the performance
of existing retrofits. Limestone stoichiometry is the number of
moles of Ca added per mole of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX> removed. Typically the required
stoichiometry of a wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> limestone system is in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.01</NUMEX>
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.01</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.05</NUMEX> typical for modern wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> A
stoichiometry of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.03</NUMEX> is typical when the FGD process is producing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gypsum</ENAMEX> by-product, while a stoichiometry of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.05</NUMEX> is needed to
produce waste suitable for a landfill. Grinding limestone to an
ultrafine particle size improves dissolution rate of limestone in
the slurry and can decrease the size requirement of the reaction
tank<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>

The construction equipment required for typical FGD
installations is standard construction equipment - welders,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excavation</ENAMEX> equipment, concrete pouring equipment, cranes, etc.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crane</ENAMEX> requirements for FGD technology retrofits are generally site
specific, although these requirements are generally less demanding
than requirements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> retrofits. Generally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems tend to
be constructed closer to the ground compared to SCR technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrofits</ENAMEX>. Lift at a site rarely exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 feet</NUMEX>) and
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 tons</NUMEX>. The use of modular and fabricated absorbers shifts much
of the construction off-site, reducing the need for specialized
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cranes</ENAMEX> and equipment. The usefulness and appropriateness of using
cranes in an FGD <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> is dependent on several factors,
including the ability to physically place a crane on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> or
adjacent to the site (e.g., on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX>) and the use of modular
construction of major FGD technology components. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prefabrication</ENAMEX> has
been used since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990</TIMEX>'s, notably on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large retrofit
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>: the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1300</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">MWe Zimmer Station</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2600</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> Gavin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> had limited lay-down area to perform the
retrofit installation. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two retrofits</TIMEX>, the absorber modules
were fabricated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces, shipped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX>, and assembled on
site. Often modular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> can be transported via <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX> or trucks
to the site for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Component modularization and
prefabrication off-site can reduce the amount of time <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> are
needed on a site, as well as provide opportunities to reduce
project schedules and construction costs and to concentrate jobs
locally at the prefabrication <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.

Implementation of an SO2 control technology at a plant involves
several activities contingent upon each other. These activities may
be grouped under the following phases of an implementation project:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
* <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> cost modeling for wet scrubber installations estimate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of limestone required to achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> SO2 removal while

conducting an engineering review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> and awarding a
procurement contract; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) obtaining a construction permit; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
installing the control technology; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) obtaining an operating
permit.
Modular construction can minimize field labor and construction
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on a site by prefabricating at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and then transporting
large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>, such as ductwork or absorber modules, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX> or
truck. For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">550</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> boiler at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas City Power</ENAMEX> &
Light Company's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hawthorne Generating Station</ENAMEX> required rebuild and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM</ENAMEX> simultaneous control retrofits. To expedite
placing the facility back into use, large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were fabricated
off site and transported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX> to the site. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX> fabrication has
also been used outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> absorber
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">modules</ENAMEX> handling a combined capacities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> MWe and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> MWe at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> were installed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1995</TIMEX> (order placed)
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> absorbers were mostly installed
sequentially with startup of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> staggered over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 months</TIMEX>.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> MWe FGD systems at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> were
fabricated off-site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three modules</TIMEX>, shipped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX>, and then
assembled on-site.
FGD installation plans and experience have been extensive in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and abroad. To date, there have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 94</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWe</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scrubber</ENAMEX> capacity built on coal-fired power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. Over
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">200 GWe</TIMEX> of capacity has been built worldwide.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibits A-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A depict the timelines typical
to complete a single absorber module and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three absorber</NUMEX>-module
installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, respectively. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three absorber</NUMEX>-module
installation assumes each absorber module can treat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 900</TIMEX> MWe
of boiler capacity. Currently, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 900 MWe</TIMEX> of single
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absorber</ENAMEX> capacity has been successfully installed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
However, greater absorber capacities are being offered outside of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S.9</ENAMEX> While the sum of the time estimated to complete
individual tasks generally exceeds the overall estimated
installation time, the overall installation schedule accounts for
overlap in these tasks. These timelines also indicate that
completion of some of the activities is contingent upon completion
of some other activities. In general, the FGD implementation
schedule appears to be driven primarily by the pre-hookup
construction activities. Multiple absorber installations will
typically add <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> to the implementation schedule,
particularly to connect additional absorbers during scheduled
outages. Prefabrication of absorber modules can reduce the overall
construction schedule. The major phases of the implementation
schedule are discussed below.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bÃ¥Ã–Ã¡Ã¥Ã‰Ã‰ÃªÃ¡Ã¥Ã–=oÃ‰Ã®Ã¡Ã‰Ã¯</ENAMEX>
As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibits A-1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-2</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A, in the first
phase of technology implementation, an engineering review and
assessment of the combustion unit is conducted to determine the
preferred compliance alternative. During this phase, the
specifications of the control technology are determined, and bids
are requested from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>. After negotiating the bids, a
contract for implementing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SO2</NUMEX> control technology is awarded.
The time necessary to complete this phase is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately four</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">`Ã§Ã¥Ã«Ã­ÃªÃ¬Ã…Ã­Ã¡Ã§Ã¥=mÃ‰ÃªÃ£Ã¡Ã­</ENAMEX>
Before the actual construction to install the technology can
commence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> must receive a construction permit from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applicable State</ENAMEX> or local regulatory authority. The construction
permit process requires that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> prepare and submit the
permit application to the applicable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> or local regulatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> or local regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> then reviews the
application and issues a draft approval. This review and approval
process is estimated to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six months</TIMEX>. The draft
construction permit is then made available for public comment.
After any necessary revisions, a final construction permit is
issued. The estimated time to obtain the construction permit is
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> months10 but can vary with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> and local
permitting procedures as well as other interests in the
project.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`Ã§Ã¥Ã­ÃªÃ§Ã¤=qÃ‰Ã…ÃœÃ¥Ã§Ã¤Ã§Ã–Ã³=fÃ¥Ã«Ã­~Ã¤Ã¤~Ã­Ã¡Ã§Ã</ENAMEX>¥
In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase, the control technology is installed. This
installation includes designing, fabricating, and installing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology. In addition, compliance testing of the control
technology is completed in this phase. Since FGD technology is not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> to the boiler, most of the construction activities, such
as earthwork, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, process electrical, and control tie-ins
to existing items, can occur while the boiler is in operation. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> needed to complete this phase of an implementation project is
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 23 months</TIMEX>.
An important element of the overall control technology
implementation is the time needed to connect, or hook up, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology equipment, particularly in relationship to the
planned outage time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. On average, it takes <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about four</NUMEX>
to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven weeks</TIMEX> to connect <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FGD.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homer City</ENAMEX> and
Centralia <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> FGD retrofit connections were performed during
the scheduled outages in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately five weeks</TIMEX>. Based on
experience in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in response to a compliance directive, a
significant quantity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SO2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> control installations were
performed within outage periods consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weeks.11 Electricity</ENAMEX> generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> often plan the
connection to occur during planned outages to avoid additional
downtime. Additional downtime leading to loss of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s
availability to supply electricity is atypical for FGD technology
installations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3,12</NUMEX> Because peak electricity demand generally occurs
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May through September</TIMEX>), typically control
connections occur during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of other seasons</TIMEX>, notably the
spring or fall<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> connections to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Centralia
units were performed outside of the peak electricity demand period.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> located where peak demand does not occur during the summer
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> may be less time-constrained to connect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> controls.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> for single and multiple systems can
typically be performed during planned outage times. Multiple
systems normally are installed in sequence and overlapping to
maintain a high level of activity at the site. Installation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> device hookup on a sequential basis usually involves an
overlap of compliance testing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> with hookup
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> with the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. The total implementation time
for sequential hookup for multiple systems is estimated at between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 months</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> absorber modules and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 months</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> absorber
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modules</ENAMEX>. Although not as common, multiple systems installed at a
single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> can be performed simultaneously. Generally,
scheduled outages will govern which method can be used for multiple
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system installations.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lÃ©Ã‰Ãª~Ã­Ã¡Ã¥Ã–=mÃ‰ÃªÃ£Ã¡Ã­</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX> will also need to modify their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating
permit to incorporate the added control devices and the associated
reduced emission limits. In some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>, an interim air-operating
permit may need to be obtained until the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX> V permit is
modified. The operating permit modification process consists of
preparation and submission of the application to the applicable
State or local regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. This process can occur
simultaneously with the processing of the construction permit
application<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> The process of transitioning from the construction
permit to the operating permit varies among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>, but the
application review process is estimated to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 9 - 11</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating permit must also be made available
for public comment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating permit is then not made
final until compliance testing on the control device is completed.
Therefore, the total estimated time to modify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating
permit is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 months</TIMEX>, plus the additional time to complete
compliance testing.
Based on the estimated time periods needed to complete each of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phases described above, the estimated time period to
complete the implementation of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> is
conservatively <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 months</TIMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s
projections reflect that the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations will
involve a single absorber unit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation per plant</ENAMEX>; however, the
maximum projected number of scrubbers retrofitted at any facility
is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> absorber <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">modules</ENAMEX> serving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> boilers with a maximum of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2400</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of boiler capacity. Changes in FGD technology and
reliability have resulted in planning for smaller and fewer
absorbers per retrofit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zimmer</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gavin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> retrofits performed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990</TIMEX>'s both
involve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> absorbers on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each 1300</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. If these retrofits
were being planned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two 1300</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> would
likely require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only two absorbers</NUMEX> per unit rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three.6</NUMEX>
Average FGD installation times have commonly been within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24-27</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. For example, recent FGD retrofit systems installed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>
City (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2001</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centralia</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX>) were both completed
within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 24 months</TIMEX>.13 Although these FGD system
installations are considered typical, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homer City</ENAMEX> FGD retrofit
installation was performed during the same time frame as the
installation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> provide more
recent insight into the ability and scheduling to install FGD
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> during a period of high demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> factor that can increase the time to install a scrubber is
competition for resources with other emission control projects.
During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time period analyzed (through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2005</TIMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> projects that a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>'s will be installed to meet
the requirements of the NOX SIP Call. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations
designed to comply with the NOX SIP Call are generally already into
the installation process or, at a minimum, into the engineering
phase of the project<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, construction has already begun
or been completed for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 GWe</NUMEX> of the scrubbers that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> projects will
be built by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> under current regulatory requirements. Typically
the overall engineering, fabrication, and construction resources
would remain the same as the scenario analyzed above, with the
exception that these resources are reallocated over an extended
schedule. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> estimate is that, as demand for installation
resources increase for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> and other air pollution control
installations, planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> retrofit installations could be between
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 and 42 months1</TIMEX> while another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> estimates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at 36 months</TIMEX>.14 It should be noted, however, that some recent
contracts have been signed to install scrubbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between now</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> that would be installed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 36 months</TIMEX>. For instance,
a contract to install a scrubber on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX>
Station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> is scheduled to be completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2004</TIMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 24 months</TIMEX> after the contract was announced, which is
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> shorter than the installation schedule set forth in
Exhibit A-1). This suggests that labor demands to install <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>'s for
the NOX SIP Call may not lead to increased installation time for
scrubbers.
Single-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations have occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as little as</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-21 months9</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> FGD <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have been installed within
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 months</TIMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of new, or "greenfield," power
generation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> often request <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 months</TIMEX> for completion of
these projects, including installation of the boiler, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>. Primarily as a cost cutting option, more relaxed
installation schedules of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 36 months</TIMEX> for a single FGD retrofit
installation may be planned, but are not common. Despite changes in
overall installation schedules, efficient utilization of labor and
sequencing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> during planned outages will continue to
be planning issues. In summary, the total time needed to complete
the design, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, and testing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a typical 500</TIMEX> MWe facility
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> unit is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 months</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 months</TIMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
boilers being served by a single absorber module, and approximately
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 months</TIMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> absorber modules (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> boiler
units). For the multiple installation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> absorber modules at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional four months</TIMEX> may be
needed to schedule the outage for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> hookup outside of the
high electricity demand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. Typically, multiple absorbers will
be installed sequentially with some overlap to conserve and
schedule continuous use of labor, as well as keep associated
installation costs down.

The installation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires a significant amount
of labor. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 80 percent</NUMEX> of the labor is for construction
of the system, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 -25 percent</NUMEX> of the labor is for engineering
and project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. The installation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> may require the following types of labor:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â– </ENAMEX> general construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for site preparation and storage
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility installation</ENAMEX>;
â–  skilled metal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for specialized hardware and/or other
material assembly and construction;
â–  other skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> such as electricians, pipe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fitters</ENAMEX>,
millwrights, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>; and
â–  unskilled labor to assist with hauling of materials and
cleanup.
A typical turnkey <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system retrofit requires
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380,000</NUMEX>=<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
percent, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX>, are dedicated to engineering and
project management<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 40 percent</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> are for
boilermakers.14 The labor required to install an absorber vessel
and ductwork is a major portion of the system installation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">man-hours</ENAMEX>. Generally, construction labor is proportional to the
amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> used in the system. The greatest labor requirement
occurs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> on a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> MWe), and additional
efficiencies in incremental labor occur when scheduling multiple
units at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, particularly when combining multiple boilers
into a single absorber. In general, large numbers of boilermakers
have been used in this industry; however, it is not expected that
this demand will impact other industries. A more thorough
discussion of boilermaker labor demand is given in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 6</ENAMEX>.
There are some efficiencies that result when multiple systems
are installed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site. In engineering alone, there is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-15</NUMEX>
percent savings in engineering and project management labor
commonly realized when installing multiple units of similar design.
In addition, other increases in project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and labor
productivity and efficiencies in using resources and equipment can
occur with multiple system installations on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site. While
multiple systems on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> are common, the number of required
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> to serve large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of capacity has been decreasing. For
example, in the past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> included
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> absorbers; however, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> these systems would likely be
designed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> absorber systems, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 650 MWe</NUMEX> of
boiler capacity per absorber<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> Using the methodology described for
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">900 MWe</TIMEX> of capacity, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-absorber system could serve as
much as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of capacity, or more than double the capacity
served in installations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990</TIMEX>'s.
A reasonable estimate of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site
includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> for the initial <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> of capacity (or
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">760 man-hours</TIMEX>/MWe) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 500</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>, up to a
total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>, for any combination into a single common
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absorber</ENAMEX>. Therefore, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires the initial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> MWe
at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">380,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second 400</TIMEX> MWe at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 273,200</NUMEX>, for
a combined labor requirement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">653,200</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX>, or approximately
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years, or the equivalent of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 725 man-hours</TIMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>.
As another example, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX> MWe system retrofit using 2 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> MWe)
turnkey systems requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 500 man-hours</TIMEX>
per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MWe.6</NUMEX> Generally, extending FGD installation schedules may
reduce the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> on a job at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time but will not
reduce the overall labor requirement.
While, it is likely that installation of multiple systems will
benefit from economies of scale to reduce labor requirements, the
range for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> for multiple systems is bounded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">725 man-hours</TIMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>. It is also clear that boiler capacities
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> can be served by a common absorber, and a
minimum <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> reduction in engineering and project management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX> will result from multiple absorbers being installed at a
single site. For example, procurement contracts only need to be
negotiated once, and common site issues need only be addressed
once. Therefore,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">653,200</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> is a conservative estimate of labor required
to install <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> at a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">900 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. Because no additional
efficiencies in engineering and project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> are assumed for
larger installations, multiple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> absorber systems each add
another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">653,200</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> requires
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,960,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> for the retrofit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>.
This produces a conservatively high estimate bounding the
uncertainties of labor and how many boilers or units will be
combined into a single absorber.
The above estimates of labor are conservative particularly given
efficiencies realized in recent retrofit installations. In many
cases, portions of retrofit construction can be performed off-site,
particularly with modular designs. For example, at the Gavin
scrubber retrofit installation the absorber modules were fabricated
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and then shipped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX> to the site for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hookup</ENAMEX>. To take advantage of off-site fabrication requires that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shop</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> are available and collocated with an adequate
shipping and transport <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> (i.e. water accessible facility
and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX>). When the requirements are met the fabrication has the
potential to employ and retain a skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX> as well as
opportunity to save time and reduce field labor requirements.
Based upon the discussion from sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>, the
total resources needed for a single <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> MWe FGD retrofit and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple FGD</ENAMEX> retrofits are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2-1</ENAMEX>.

Generally <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-acre</NUMEX> on-site will allow the installation of an FGD
retrofit<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> The need for additional space for support <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> ranges
from no additional space needed to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 acres</NUMEX> typical for up-front
reagent processing and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 acre</NUMEX> for dewatering when reagent
processing and dewatering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are selected as part of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system design. Space issues also include the positioning of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> after the particulate control device and before the stack. This
area of the power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> is generally referred to as the "back
end"
- an area where there is typically ample space for retrofit
installations.
The FGD retrofit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinergy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibson Unit 4</ENAMEX> is an example of
an extremely space limited retrofit<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibson Unit 4</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">668</NUMEX> MWe
inhibited oxidation limestone FGD retrofit designed for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">92 percent</NUMEX>
SO2 removal and completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1994</TIMEX>. In the case of this
scrubber retrofit, the congestion at the site did not allow for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX> pick by a standard sized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crane</ENAMEX>. With up-front planning, one
module was raised by less conventional means (jacking
construction), allowing for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> module to be constructed
using more conventional methods. Because of the difficulty due to
congestion of the site, this retrofit required additional time and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor</ENAMEX>, but worked within space constraints. This method of jacking
construction has been used in other retrofits. The wet FGD retrofit
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bailly Generating Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Units 7</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">& 8</NUMEX>, is an example
where a full service system (single limestone absorber for combined
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">528</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> capacity, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.5 percent</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur coal</ENAMEX>, ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> SO2
removal) was able to significantly reduce space requirements while
also decreasing cost by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-half</NUMEX> and creating no new waste
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streams</ENAMEX>. Much of the success of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>/private project
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOE/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>) was due to a more compact and
multi-functional (pre-quenching, absorption, and oxidation)
absorber <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> that used a co-current flow design. As a result,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> required only modest space requirements<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> In most
locations connection space is not a problem since there is usually
adequate space behind the flue gas stack to perform the scrubber
retrofit. If connection space is limited, additional ductwork may
be necessary.

Often absorbers can be designed to accommodate site-specific
requirements. Smaller absorbers, use of common absorbers for
multiple boilers, and technology advances that supplant the need
for redundant absorbers, have decreased the footprint needed for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modern FGD</ENAMEX> retrofit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>. Where space for the FGD
installation is an issue, reducing the overall absorber size can be
accomplished by using multiple absorber trays (within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one absorber</NUMEX>)
and improving mass transfer with the use of a fan<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX> Improved
absorption at higher velocities has contributed to smaller, more
compact absorbers. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> are continually improving
absorber efficiencies by increasing absorber gas velocities in the
range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 m/</ENAMEX>s (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 feet</NUMEX>/s) and greater. Velocities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1</NUMEX> m/s (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
feet/s) have been demonstrated<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.8</TIMEX> By contrast, earlier systems'
design capacities were based on absorber flue gas velocities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m/s</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
feet/s). In addition to smaller absorbers, single absorbers
commonly serve multiple boilers, reducing the overall footprint of
the FGD retrofit. To date, a single absorber has been successfully
installed to serve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of capacity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> while even
larger absorber modules (i.e. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> MWe and greater) are now being
offered for purchase overseas.
Space for an FGD <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> may also include areas for reagent
processing and treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX> or byproduct. Complete
limestone processing (delivery, crushing, slurry preparation,
reagent feed equipment, etc.) requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as much as 2</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 acres</NUMEX>;
however, this space is a one-time requirement and does not increase
with increasing FGD capacity being served. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conservatively</ENAMEX>, when
on-site reagent processing is selected, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an additional 2.5 acres</NUMEX> for
an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> will be sufficient. While limestone processing
can be performed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, purchased powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">limestone</ENAMEX> is
an option that also reduces or eliminates the requirement for
on-site reagent preparation and other equipment, as well as the
space these processes would occupy. Ultra-fine limestone has been
demonstrated as an optional enhancement over typical limestone
reagent feed<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX> In areas where the ability to deliver limestone on
a continuous basis during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter months</TIMEX> may be limited, storage of
limestone may be needed. For example, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> supply of limestone
to feed a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MWe FGD</ENAMEX> system (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> control efficiency, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
percent capacity, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur coal</ENAMEX>) will require approximately
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 by 40 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120 by 120 foot</NUMEX>) storage area to handle approximately
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23,000 tons</NUMEX> of limestone.
Traditionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems have produced a solid waste product
that can be sent to a landfill, or an increasingly attractive
alternative is to treat the byproduct for the manufacture and sale
of gypsum. If dewatering is required, typically <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-acre</NUMEX> will be
needed for an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> regardless of the amount of FGD
capacity being served. One approach to improving sorbent
utilization is recycling the spent sorbent for multiple exposure to
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SO2</NUMEX> in the flue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. The result is less unreacted sorbent and
smaller quantities of end product<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> Improved performance and
alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reagents</ENAMEX> are becoming common. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990</TIMEX>'s, at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> was supplying a system that took advantage of
a water treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>'s precipitated calcium and magnesium
carbonates that produced a high quality, fine calcium and magnesium
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carbonate FGD</ENAMEX> reagent. In addition to reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>'s
dependence on limestone, this process also reduced equipment
required for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">limestone</ENAMEX> handling and milling<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
More efficient use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in modern systems has almost
completely removed the need for dewatering and containment ponds.
Typically, purge streams are used if the wastewater contains high
levels of chlorides. However, usually <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is either evaporated
from the system or remains in the by-product or waste. Techniques
for wastewater minimization or elimination are commonly available.
For example, many FGD systems repeatedly cycle the cooling tower
blow-down before being treated in the wastewater system. As a
result, the wastewater has a high solids content as well as high
alkalinity for improved performance. Since large amounts of water
are evaporated during this cycling, this method also benefits from
reduced effluent that requires treatment by a wastewater
system<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX>
While water treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> effluent was once a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contemporary FGD</ENAMEX> systems are much more effective in limiting
production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste water</ENAMEX> and can achieve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, or near-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>,
wastewater discharge<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> Many of the wastewater advances being used
outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, including conserving blowdown in the absorber
vessel primarily for chloride control, are now being used or
considered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> For example, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">446</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe Hunter Unit</ENAMEX> 3
(operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PacifiCorp</ENAMEX>) installed a wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> limestone reagent
system in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>; and, by use of mechanical draft cooling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-discharge for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste water</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system operates at
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.12 lb</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SO2/MMBtu</ENAMEX> and is designed for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> SO2 removal. An
additional example of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> wastewater discharge is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">446</NUMEX> MWe

In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, retrofit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> will be assessed for coal-fired
electric utility boilers that would be affected by a multipollutant
regulation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> control technology that is expected to
have the greatest impact on future utility boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NOX</ENAMEX> emissions and
is the most difficult NOX control technology to install. It is,
therefore, the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> control technology to understand
from both a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> reduction and resource requirement perspective.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pÃ³Ã«Ã­Ã‰Ã£=e~ÃªÃ‡Ã¯~ÃªÃ</ENAMEX>‰
The SCR process operates by reacting ammonia with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exhaust gas</ENAMEX> in the presence of a catalyst at temperatures of around
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">315</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">370 ÂºC</NUMEX>. For most applications, this temperature range makes
it necessary to locate the SCR reactor adjacent to the boiler -
immediately after the boiler and before the air preheater as shown
in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. An infrequently used alternative approach is to
locate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>. This approach, however, increases
operating costs, as it requires additional heating of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. By
locating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> as in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, it is often necessary to
install the catalyst <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> in an elevated location, which may
result in a structure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of feet</NUMEX> tall. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> shows the
configuration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> that was retrofit onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AES Somerset</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Station</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">675 MWe</NUMEX> boiler already equipped with an electrostatic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precipitator</ENAMEX> (ESP) and wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system. In this common installation,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> is installed on structural steel that elevates it
above existing ductwork and the ESP (designated "precipitator" in
the Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-2</ENAMEX>). In the lower right corner of Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, an image

installation.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> system reduces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> through a reaction of ammonia and NOX
in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> and a
catalyst at temperatures around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">315 to 370 Â°C</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600 to 700</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ÂºF</ENAMEX>). The products of this reaction are water
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vapor</ENAMEX> and nitrogen. The catalyst is mounted inside an
expanded section of ductwork and is configured
for the gas to pass through it as in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-2.

The major components of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> include:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â–  Ammonia</ENAMEX> or urea storage
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â–  Ammonia</ENAMEX> vaporization system (if aqueous ammonia is used)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â–  Urea</ENAMEX> to ammonia converter (if urea is used)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â–  Ammonia</ENAMEX> or urea <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">metering</ENAMEX> and controls
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â–  Dilution</ENAMEX> air blowers
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â–  Ammonia</ENAMEX> injection grid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â–  Catalyst</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â–  Catalyst</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX>, ductwork and support steel
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â–  Catalyst</ENAMEX> cleaning devices (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soot blowers</ENAMEX>, sonic horns, etc)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â–  Instrumentation</ENAMEX>

Except for the catalyst, most of the material/equipment used to
assemble an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> system is either standard mechanical and electrical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> (pumps, blowers, valves, piping, heaters, pressure
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessels</ENAMEX>, temperature and pressure sensors, etc.) or is largely
manufactured for other power plant applications and has been
adopted for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> systems (cleaning devices such as soot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blowers</ENAMEX> or sonic horns, gas analyzers, etc.). The catalyst,
however, is a specialized product designed specifically for this
purpose.
The catalyst is typically a ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> that, in most
cases, is either extruded into a ceramic honeycomb <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or is
coated onto plates, as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The catalyst is
assembled into modules at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>. The modules are shipped to
the site and installed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> in layers. Each layer
of catalyst is comprised of several individual modules that are
installed side-by-side.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> used in the largest quantity, aside from a catalyst
or reagent, is steel. The amount of steel required for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> in
the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">300-500 MWe</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 800 to 1200 tons,20</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2.4</NUMEX>
to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.6 tons</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 4,000 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> is necessary for
retrofit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> total)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,20 or about 2.2</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> used for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> includes large structural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, plates, and sheets. These steel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are used to
fabricate the catalyst <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX>, the ductwork, and the support
steel. There is typically less of a requirement for corrosive
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resistant alloys</ENAMEX> for an SCR <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> when compared to a
scrubber <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>. Steel is also needed for boiler
modifications. In this case, large pieces of steam piping or other
large steel boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> may need to be replaced. The catalyst
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reactor</ENAMEX> is often fabricated on-site. Sections of the catalyst
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reactor</ENAMEX> and ductwork may be fabricated off-site and shipped in
pieces to the site for final assembly, or they may be fabricated
on-site into subassemblies and lifted into place during
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">erection</ENAMEX>.
If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> boiler at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> is to be retrofit with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, then some, but not all, equipment can be made common. For
example, it may be possible, and is probably preferable, to have a
common ammonia
or urea storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. Reagent storage is probably the only
major equipment item that lends itself to sharing between adjacent
boilers. Therefore, there is some gained efficiency in the use of
equipment at a site with multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. However, this gain in
efficiency is generally small compared to the total project. The
major synergy will be in construction equipment and in labor, as
will be discussed in Sections <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.3 and 3.5</NUMEX>, respectively.

An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires an initial and ongoing supply of
catalyst. It also requires reagent. The reagent can be ammonia or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">urea</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to date have used ammonia; however, urea is
becoming an increasingly popular reagent due to its inherent safety
and the recent availability of systems to convert urea to ammonia
on-site.


`<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">~Ã­~Ã¤Ã³Ã«Ã</ENAMEX>­
The amount of catalyst required for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> system is directly
proportional to the capacity (or gas flowrate) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, if
all other variables are equal. The actual amount of catalyst for
any specific plant depends upon several parameters; in particular,
the amount per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> (measured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">m3</TIMEX> per MWe) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> level of
reduction and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> will fall within a general range. Therefore,
it is possible to make an estimate of how much catalyst would be
necessary to retrofit a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> or a large number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> if the total capacity is known. It is assumed that most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> systems to be retrofit onto electric utility boilers will be
designed for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 90 percent</NUMEX> reduction. For most boilers, this
level of reduction may initially require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.90 to 1.3 m3</NUMEX> of
catalyst for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of coal-fired boiler capacity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18,21,22</NUMEX> For
example, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> would be expected to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 450 to 650</NUMEX>
m3 of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX>. The amount of catalyst for a particular situation
will vary somewhat depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">catalyst supplier</ENAMEX> and the
difficulty of the application. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">675 MWe AES Somerset Boiler</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> NOX reduction was achieved with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">897</NUMEX> m3 of
plate catalyst<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,19</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 1.33 m3</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>. This unit fires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>
percent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur coal</ENAMEX>. At each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">745 and 755</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe Montour Units</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1&2, 671</ENAMEX> m3 of ceramic catalyst were used<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,22 or about 0.89</NUMEX> m3
per MWe. This unit fires <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5 percent</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur coal</ENAMEX> that can have
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> levels <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as high as 100 ppm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">limestone</ENAMEX> injection is used to
reduce gaseous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> concentration in the furnace). The amount of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalyst</ENAMEX> will tend to be lower in situations that are less
challenging, such as with lower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur coals</ENAMEX> or situations expected
to have lower gaseous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic concentration</ENAMEX> (gaseous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">arsenic</ENAMEX> is a
catalyst poison that originates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>; it will reduce the
lifetime of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX>). Hence, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 0.90 m3</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> may
be sufficient in some cases.
The catalyst is typically loaded in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more layers. This
permits replacement of sections of the catalyst as activity is
reduced. The advantage of this approach is that it permits lower
overall catalyst usage over the economic lifetime of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.
Normally, room for an extra layer is provided, so a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> layer
can be added, if necessary. At the first catalyst addition
(typically, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 24,000</NUMEX> operating <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> layer
will be filled or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> filled. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> is full, layers
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> are replaced after catalyst activity drops to a minimum
level. At the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst replacement</ENAMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> will replace
the original first layer; at the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst replacement</ENAMEX>, new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalyst</ENAMEX> will replace the original second layer, and so on. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
modeling projections conservatively assumed that one layer of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catalyst</ENAMEX> is replaced for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of operation
for coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Therefore, after the initial installation,
there is a need to replace <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> of the total catalyst
reactor volume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 24- 32 months</TIMEX> or so - or conservatively about
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/8</NUMEX> of the installed volume should be replaced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coal-fired</ENAMEX> installations.
The catalyst may also be regenerated rather than replaced<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX>
This will reduce the amount of new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> that must be purchased.
However, due to the limited experience with this method, it will be
assumed that the catalyst is replaced according to the catalyst
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">oÃ‰~Ã–Ã‰Ã¥Ã­Ã</ENAMEX>« The amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reagent</ENAMEX> consumed in the SCR process is
directly proportional to the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> reduced. Although
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ammonia</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> that actually participates in the chemical
reaction, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> have developed equipment to convert urea
to ammonia on-site. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> of urea-to-ammonia
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">converters</ENAMEX>, each mole of urea within the conversion system is
converted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> moles of ammonia<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> For example, reducing one
pound of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> will require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 0.176 kg</NUMEX> of ammonia or about
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.312 kg</NUMEX> of urea. This includes a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Â½ percent</NUMEX> increase in reagent
demand due to ammonia slip and a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</NUMEX> increase to account
for a small amount of nitrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">NO2</NUMEX>) in the flue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>.
Therefore, for any given plant size, the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reagent</ENAMEX> consumption can be estimated. For a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> reducing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/MMBtu to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMBtu</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> capacity
factor (this is conservatively high for most coal boilers),
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,400 tons</NUMEX>/yr of ammonia (anhydrous equivalent) or
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 6,100 tons</NUMEX>/yr of urea (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 100 percent</NUMEX> urea) would be needed.
The same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> would have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 450-650 m3</NUMEX> of catalyst
with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 120-160 m3</NUMEX> replaced about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>. This is,
if a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the initial catalyst loading must be replaced, on
average, every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000 to 20,000</NUMEX> operating <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.015</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.0289 cubic meters</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MWe</ENAMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1000 hours</TIMEX> must be replaced.

Construction equipment needed for installation of an SCR
includes standard construction equipment - welders, excavation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>, concrete pouring equipment, cranes, etc. In some cases,
installers may use tall-span heavy-lift <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> are
capable of lifting heavy loads, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as much as 100 tons</NUMEX> or more,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> feet. The advantage of this crane type is realized
when lifting assembled sections of catalyst <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> or other large
pieces high off the ground. If lower capacity <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> are used,
smaller pieces must be lifted, which means that less
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pre-</ENAMEX>fabrication is possible and more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> must be done in
place. Less pre-fabrication could lengthen the necessary boiler
outage somewhat. Although the availability of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> is
reported to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60 or more</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> can be supplied
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every six months</TIMEX>.25 It has been reported that, in some cases, it
has been necessary to go further away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> to source
cranes with adequate lift and reach capacity. In other cases,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> found that by changing the design/fabrication method to
meet the available crane, the project could be managed with lower
capacity cranes (lifting smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26,27</NUMEX> If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
boiler is retrofit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crane</ENAMEX> can be used for
both boilers, saving cost and time when compared to boilers
retrofit separately. It is important to note that in many cases the
erection method is not limited by the available crane, but is
limited by the access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> (For example, can large sections
be delivered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX>, rail, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX>?) and by the available
lay-down area for material and construction equipment on site. At
many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, there is inadequate area to prefabricate large
sections. In some instances, transportation routes to the facility
do not permit transporting large, pre-assembled equipment to the
site. In such cases, it will not be possible to do much
pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, and a smaller, less expensive crane may be adequate.
As a result, the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crane</ENAMEX> that is best for a particular SCR
installation frequently is not the largest crane available. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crane</ENAMEX> selected for a project will be determined as part of an
overall construction plan developed to optimize all of the
available resources - labor, material, and equipment - for a
particular project.
The need to lift material to high elevations is a result of the
location of the SCR - often above existing ductwork and adjacent to
existing equipment. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> provided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> good example of this.
It may be necessary to move existing equipment, such as the air
preheater, in order to accommodate the addition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX>.
As a result, every retrofit is a custom fit. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>
have been very innovative when installing these systems, even on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> that apparently had little room available for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>.
Hence, the physical size of the technology has not been
limiting.

Implementation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> control technology at a plant involves
several activities contingent upon each other. These activities may
be grouped under the following phases of an implementation project:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) conducting an engineering review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> and awarding a
procurement contract; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) obtaining a construction permit; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
installing the control technology; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) obtaining an operating
permit.
Exhibit A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Appendix A</ENAMEX> depicts the timeline expected for
completing a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>. Completion of some of
the activities is contingent upon completion of some other
activities. For example, construction activities cannot commence
until a construction permit is obtained. In general, the SCR
implementation timeline appears to be driven primarily by the
engineering activities (i.e., design, fabrication, and
construction).

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bÃ¥Ã–Ã¡Ã¥Ã‰Ã‰ÃªÃ¡Ã¥Ã–=oÃ‰Ã®Ã¡Ã‰Ã¯</ENAMEX>
As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-3</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A, an engineering review and
assessment of the combustion unit is conducted in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase
of technology implementation to determine the preferred compliance
alternative. During this phase, the specifications of the control
technology are determined, and bids are requested from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>.
After negotiating the bids, a contract for implementing the NOX
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology is awarded. The time necessary to complete this
phase is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">`Ã§Ã¥Ã«Ã­ÃªÃ¬Ã…Ã­Ã¡Ã§Ã¥=mÃ‰ÃªÃ£Ã¡Ã­</ENAMEX>
Before the actual construction to install the technology can
commence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> must receive a construction permit from the
applicable state or local regulatory authority. The construction
permit process requires that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> prepare and submit the
permit application to the applicable state or local regulatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>. The state or local regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> then reviews the
application and issues a draft approval. This review and approval
process is estimated to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six months</TIMEX>. The draft
construction permit is then made available for public comment.
After any necessary revisions, a final construction permit is
issued. The actual time needed will depend on the size and
complexity of the project and the local procedures for issuing a
permit. Exhibit A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A shows that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months</TIMEX> are
allowed for the construction permit. This is expected to be ample
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only about 4-5 months</TIMEX> were needed for obtaining
the construction permit<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,26</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only six months</TIMEX> were needed to
obtain the construction permit for retrofit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 900</NUMEX> MWe boilers
in another case<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX> Shorter periods for construction permit
authorization would allow earlier commencement of construction
activities and could potentially shorten the overall schedule.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`Ã§Ã¥Ã­ÃªÃ§Ã¤=qÃ‰Ã…ÃœÃ¥Ã§Ã¤Ã§Ã–Ã³=fÃ¥Ã«Ã­~Ã¤Ã¤~Ã­Ã¡Ã§Ã</ENAMEX>¥
In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase, the control technology is installed. This
installation includes designing, fabricating, and installing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology. In addition, compliance testing of the control
technology is also completed in this phase. Most of the
construction activities, such as earthwork, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>,
process
electrical and control tie-ins to existing items, can occur
while the boiler is in operation. The time needed to complete this
phase of an implementation project is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 months</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>.
An important element of the overall control technology
implementation is the time needed to connect, or hook up, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology equipment to the combustion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> because the
boiler typically must be shut down for this period. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> connection
can occur in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three to five week</TIMEX> outage period.28 In some cases
longer outages are needed. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babcock & Wilcox</ENAMEX> retrofitted
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">675</NUMEX> MWe AES <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset</ENAMEX> boiler, the outage began on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 14</TIMEX>, and
the boiler was returned to service on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 26 - about a six-week</TIMEX>
outage<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19 One</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system supplier</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> stated that
they would want in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> of boiler down
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and have never required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than two months</TIMEX>.27 Difficulty is
increased as the extent of boiler modifications necessary to fit
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> is increased. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> system
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">supplier</ENAMEX> installed SCR on a significant portion of the German
capacity within outage periods consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than four</NUMEX>
weeks<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> Based upon outages in this time range for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> connection,
electricity-generating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> would normally be able to plan
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> connection to occur during planned outages to avoid
additional downtime. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> have been innovative in
their construction plans to minimize down time. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Authority</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX>'s) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MWe Paradise Unit 2</ENAMEX>, it was
necessary to demolish the existing ESP with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> on line. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX>
installed a construction bypass to send <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> from the air preheater
outlet directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, while the ESP was being demolished and
the SCR reactor erected in its place<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> However, in more difficult
retrofits, down time might be impacted in a significant way. In
some cases it may be desirable to plan a brief outage in advance of
the hook-up to install structural steel through sleeves placed in
existing equipment, such as the ESP, or to relocate existing
equipment that would otherwise interfere with erection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>.
This permits erection of the catalyst <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> above existing
equipment while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> is on line<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX> However, because an SCR
project is expected to extend close to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> (see Exhibits A-3
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-4</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A), it should be possible to incorporate this
work into planned outages, which would have occurred regardless of
whether an SCR was to be installed.


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lÃ©Ã‰Ãª~Ã­Ã¡Ã¥Ã–=mÃ‰ÃªÃ£Ã¡Ã­</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX> will also need to modify their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating
permit to incorporate the added control devices and the associated
reduced emission limits. In some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, an interim air-operating
permit may need to be obtained until the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX> V permit is
modified. The operating permit modification process consists of
preparation and submission of the application to the applicable
state or local regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-3</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Appendix A</ENAMEX>, this process can occur simultaneously with the
processing of the construction permit application. The process of
transitioning from the construction permit to the operating permit
varies among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and appears to be somewhat unclear due to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infancy of the Title</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> operating permit process. Nonetheless, based
on discussions with several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, the application review process
is estimated to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 9-11 months</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX> V
operating permit must also be made available for public comment.
Following public comment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating permit is not made
final until compliance testing on the control device is completed.
Therefore, the total estimated time to modify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating
permit is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 months</TIMEX>, plus the additional time to complete
compliance testing<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>
Based on the estimated time periods needed to complete each of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phases described above, the estimated time period to
complete the implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> combustion unit is about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 months</TIMEX>. This time period is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-3</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix A.</ENAMEX>
However, depending upon the specifics of the project, the time
needed could vary by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX>. For example, at AES
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somerset</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, the time to complete the retrofit from the point
of contract award was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months</TIMEX>.19 Assuming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX> of work
prior to contract award, a total elapsed time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 months</TIMEX> would
have been necessary to retrofit this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">675 MWe</NUMEX> boiler. Another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility, Reliant Energy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, has
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-corner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>fired combustion engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that
burn approx <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5 percent</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur bituminous coal</ENAMEX>. Reliant intends to
reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> from a baseline of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/MMBtu to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/MMBtu.
The permit to construct was received in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately six months</TIMEX>.
The time from placing the order to completion of commissioning
activities is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46 weeks</TIMEX> for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. However, preliminary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX> was accomplished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. Even if preliminary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX> and contract negotiation took as long as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six to eight</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, the total time for completing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> would be
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 17 to 19 months</TIMEX>.21 For the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Madrid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, units <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 & 2</ENAMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> each), the specifications were released to turnkey
contractors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1998</TIMEX>, the project specification was
released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1998</TIMEX>, the contract was awarded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 26, 1998</TIMEX>,
and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was in operation by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2000</TIMEX>. In this
project, an option for a second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was available (and was
exercised), and air preheaters were replaced<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> should be a reasonable, and in some cases a conservative
estimate of the total time necessary to retrofit a single utility
boiler.
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> does not expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> will be
implemented at every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. For those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> projects
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> retrofits will occur, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s projections reflect that these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> will typically have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 4</NUMEX> boilers retrofit per site.
However, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> retrofits are projected to be
installed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. Exhibit A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A examines a schedule
for retrofitting a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> retrofits.
This examines the installation of the control device hook-up on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequential</ENAMEX> basis. Installation is staggered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three months</TIMEX>
between sequential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to enable more efficient utilization of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manpower</ENAMEX> and project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> than if multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were
connected at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time. This approach also assures that at least
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 83 percent</NUMEX> of the plant capacity is available at any given
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> boiler is shut down), and during most of the time
there is no impact to the plant availability at all. This approach
requires a total time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 months</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> retrofits. An
alternative approach might be to schedule outages to avoid any
outage during high electricity demand periods. This might extend
the total elapsed time by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four months</TIMEX>. However, because there
is a substantial amount of work that can be accomplished with the
boiler on line, the additional time would be much less than the
number of high electricity demand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> that are accommodated by
this approach. Another alternative approach would involve retrofit
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> at a time during low-demand periods and
avoiding any outage during high demand periods. This alternative
could result in a faster project completion, but would have less
even labor utilization, which is an important cost-benefit
tradeoff<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX>
In summary, the total time needed to complete the design,
installation, and testing at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> unit is about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 months</TIMEX>; at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple SCR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, total
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 35 months</TIMEX>. Based on these timelines, it is
estimated, in principal, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> controls needed to comply
with a multipollutant strategy can be met provided that: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an
adequate supply of materials and labor is available, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology implementation process begins at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> prior to the date controls must be in place. However,
ideally, longer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 months</TIMEX> would allow for all of the retrofits
to occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a period of several years</TIMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> can
properly plan outages and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> can properly plan for resource
availability.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PKR</ENAMEX> i~Ã„Ã§Ãª
The installation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires a significant amount
of labor. Most of the labor is necessary for the construction of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. However, engineering and project management labor are
also needed for the project. The total construction labor for an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> system of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> is in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">333,000 to 350,000</NUMEX>
man-hours<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22,27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Typically</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40-50 percent</NUMEX> of the labor
is for boilermakers<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX> However, the percent of labor for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boilermakers</ENAMEX> will vary from one project to another, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40-50</NUMEX>
percent
being an average for several projects<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.32</NUMEX> Some projects require a
higher degree of boiler integration and less erected steel and,
therefore, have a higher percentage of boilermaker labor. Other
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> require extensive steel erection with less boiler
integration and will, therefore, have a lower percentage of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">boilermakers</ENAMEX> versus other trades. For a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, the
construction labor would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 340,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX>, of this
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 136,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> would be boilermaker activity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engineering</ENAMEX> and project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 5 percent</NUMEX> of the total
cost, while construction is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 percent</NUMEX> of the total cost<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX>
If labor rates for engineering and project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> - 100
percent greater than construction labor, then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 17,000</NUMEX> to about
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> of engineering and project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> are needed
for the project. Total <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">labor man-hours</TIMEX> of construction and
engineering labor are then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 365,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> for a single 500
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
Construction <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> are approximately proportional to the
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of steel fabricated. As noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> needed for
multiple boiler installations is generally not reduced
significantly over the projects if they were installed separately.
However, if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> system is installed at a site, some
significant efficiencies result.
When there are multiple units retrofit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only, one</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mobilization</ENAMEX> is needed for all of the boilers, only one
construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> is required, and equipment is more
efficiently used. As a result, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15-20 percent</NUMEX> efficiencies can be
realized from these activities and can be planned into the
project<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long-term</ENAMEX> projects, such as retrofits of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
unit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site, also lend themselves to additional efficiencies
from learning curves. Learning curves result from productivity
improvements over the duration of the project. Productivity
measures the actual <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> used versus those planned. A
productivity value over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> indicates that fewer <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> are
needed to accomplish the goal than expected. A labor productivity
value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> means that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> more work was accomplished for
the level of labor expended than if a productivity value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> was
achieved. There are examples of productivity improvements of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 percent</NUMEX> during the project due to additional efficiencies gained
from learning curves<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX> If only <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> or less improved
efficiency results from planned reduced labor and from productivity
improvements that occur after the project commences, the labor for

each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">additional 500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> might be reduced from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340,000</NUMEX>
man-hours to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 310,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,170,000</NUMEX>
construction <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.
For a site with multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, the total engineering and
project management <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> are likely to be significantly less
than the total if each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> were addressed separately. This is
because there will be many common site issues that need to be
addressed and engineered only once. Procurement contracts need to
be negotiated only once, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> project management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is
needed over the duration of the contract. However, it is difficult
to say how much engineering will be reduced, because adjacent units
may be very similar or very different. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> approximation is to make
total engineering, project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and testing proportional to
the project duration. Thus, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> would require
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 42,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> of engineering and project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.
Based upon the discussion from sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>, the
total resources needed for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single 500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and a site with

An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> system for a coal-fired boiler may have a negligible
impact on the footprint of the boiler. This is because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> is
frequently installed in an elevated position near the boiler and
well off of the ground. The choice of installing the SCR reactor
near the ground level or elevated well above ground level depends
upon which configuration is viewed as most cost effective while
considering installation cost and operating cost. Locating the SCR
in an elevated location near the boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">economizer</ENAMEX> and air
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preheater</ENAMEX> is frequently done to minimize the length of ductwork
(with the associated pressure loss) and because no additional real
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estate</ENAMEX> is necessary for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX>. When this type of
installation is performed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> is installed atop a
steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> that must be erected above existing equipment, such
as the electrostatic precipitator. This is an approach that is
frequently used because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> have developed cost effective
methods to install the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> while addressing potential
interferences from existing equipment. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> of this document
discussed how brief outages, in advance of the outage to connect
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, were taken to address interferences and permit SCR
reactor
construction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> on line. In some cases, however, the
preferred approach has been to locate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> on the ground
near the boiler and to route the ductwork to and from the SCR
reactor. This is the approach that was taken on the retrofit of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSNH Merrimack Unit 2</ENAMEX>, the first retrofit of a coal-fired boiler in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In this case there was a large amount of space
near the boiler to permit this approach. Regardless of where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> is located, ductwork from the economizer outlet to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX> and back to the air preheater inlet must be
accommodated. In cases where space for this ductwork was extremely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>, the air preheater was relocated. However, relocation of
the air preheater(s) usually is not necessary. Only a few
installations have required the relocation of the air
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preheater</ENAMEX>.
The other item that must be located is the reagent storage
system. This usually does not take up as much room as the SCR
reactor itself. However, the storage and unloading system must be
located near rail or truck access to permit delivery of reagent. In
some cases, long piping is run from the storage and unloading area
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactor</ENAMEX>. In these cases, the piping may be insulated and
heat traced to prevent condensation of the ammonia vapor.

Under a multipollutant control scenario, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury emissions</ENAMEX> would
be controlled from coal-fired power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> by equipment that
reduces emissions of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> (e.g., scrubbers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>) and
the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorbent</ENAMEX> injection. Other methods are being investigated
(such as oxidation and scrubbing technologies), which utilize
ozone, barrier discharge, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> and/or chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX> in
combination with existing technologies. To the extent that other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> are developed, these would provide more options for
compliance, so their introduction would serve to reduce issues
related to resource requirements of installing controls. Similarly,
with regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorbent</ENAMEX> injection, sorbents other than activated
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>) may ultimately prove to be superior for this
application in terms of cost or collection efficiency performance
and may reduce the likely demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> from what is projected
here. Nevertheless, all of the sorbent-based approaches use similar
hardware to inject sorbent as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the assumption of ACI
as a control method will provide a fairly representative indication
of the demand for hardware and construction resources regardless of
which sorbents are used in the market. The assumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> control method will be more conservative with regard to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorbent</ENAMEX> consumption since it will assume that all of the facilities
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">installing sorbent</ENAMEX> injection for mercury control require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> is typically injected at the lowest temperature available
that is upstream of a particle-collecting
device because experience has found that mercury collection
is most efficient at lower temperatures. On
a boiler equipped with an ESP or a fabric filter (FF) for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">particle</ENAMEX> collection, the configuration would look
as in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> is somewhat more
efficient when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> is used for particle
collection because of the higher gas-sorbent contact in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> cake. Another approach is to have
injection downstream of an ESP, which would collect most of
the coal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fly ash</ENAMEX>, and upstream of a fabric
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> (FF), which would mostly capture sorbent. This
approach is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The advantages
of this approach are that greater mercury capture occurs
because of the additional mercury capture that
can occur on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FF filter cake</ENAMEX>; and, because the ash is
largely separated from the sorbent, more efficient
sorbent utilization is possible through sorbent recycling.
This approach could be implemented through
addition of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pulse Jet Fabric Filter</ENAMEX> (PJFF) when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> is
installed.

The ACI System consists of the following components, as shown in
the simplified schematic of Figure
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-3:</TIMEX>

â–  A silo for storing the sorbent
â–  A metering system for metering the amount of sorbent
injected into the ductwork - typically a rotary

<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metering valve â–  A pneumatic</ENAMEX> or mechanical conveying system for
moving the sorbent to the injection location
â–  An injection system for dispersing and distributing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sorbent</ENAMEX> in the boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ductwork</ENAMEX>. For many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, injection of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sorbent</ENAMEX> will occur after the air preheater and upstream of the ESP
or FF. This injection system is principally made from piping that
may split off to manifolds for injecting in multiple locations.
Special nozzles or other hardware are generally not required.
â–  A blower to provide a carrying medium
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â–  Associated piping</ENAMEX> for the blower and the distribution
system
â–  A humidification system may be used in some cases to reduce
temperature and improve mercury capture. The humidification system
will typically consist of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water spray injectors</ENAMEX> (possibly air
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atomized</ENAMEX>) located upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> injectors, a grid for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray injectors</ENAMEX>, and a water supply system that will include
pumping and metering systems.
â–  A control system that may utilize a programmable logic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">controller</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX>) or may be accommodated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> distributed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> system (DCS)

To ESP Or FF
Regardless of boiler size, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> will require the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>. The principal differences will be the size of the
sorbent storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">silo</ENAMEX>, the size of the metering and conveying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, and the size and number of injectors for the sorbent
injection system.
There are also several other combinations that may be used,
including combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray dryer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> and
combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">FGD.32</NUMEX> The various combinations will be
discussed further in Section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>. In each of these combinations,
the actual equipment associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system is similar. The
particular combination of equipment chosen for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> reduction at
a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> is largely determined by the existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> and conditions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. However, most facilities
are currently equipped with ESPs, and some are equipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFs</ENAMEX>.
Thus, the most likely scenario for application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> is in a
configuration with ESP or FF.
Most existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> have ESPs for particle emission control
and do not have any SO2 removal technology. Therefore, injection of
sorbent, and possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for humidification, will most often be
performed downstream of the air preheater and upstream of the
electrostatic precipitator, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> temperature is typically
in the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">280-300 ÂºF.</ENAMEX> In this part of the boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ductwork</ENAMEX>,
there are no water wall tubes. Therefore, the mechanical interface
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system and the boiler is through the duct walls,
and high-pressure boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tubing</ENAMEX> will not be affected by the
retrofit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> offer other sorbent-based methods for reduction
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury emissions</ENAMEX>; however, the equipment used is very similar
in scope to the equipment used for ACI<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.32</NUMEX>
The majority of the equipment used for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system is produced
from standard mechanical or electrical hardware that is sold for a
wide range of purposes. The total amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> is relatively
small in comparison to an SCR or an FGD for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.27 The
estimated steel requirement for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MWe ACI</ENAMEX> system is indicated
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4-1.33</ENAMEX> Since the largest item contributing to the steel
requirement is the storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">silo</ENAMEX>, it will be assumed that the total
steel requirement is proportional to the capacity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, as
the storage requirement would be proportional to the capacity. For
multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site, all but the silo would certainly need
to be duplicated. It is possible that there might be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> large silo
serving several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> feed off of it, or, that
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">silos</ENAMEX> may be needed. In any event, the synergies in
reducing total steel requirement over what would be needed for
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> is expected to be small.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> is assumed to be the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reagent</ENAMEX> used to absorb the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> in the exhaust <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX>. Most of the information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>
injection requirements for a coal-fired power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is from pilot
studies and demonstrations of ACI technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4-2</ENAMEX> shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>
injection rates estimated from the data provided a comprehensive
assessment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> under a range of scenarios<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX> For example, to
achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> mercury reduction from a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> bituminous
coal using an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> with humidification will require a
treatment rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/million acf (MMacf)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX> If a pulsejet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FF</ENAMEX> (PJFF) is used downstream, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorbent</ENAMEX> injection rate can be
reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/MMacf. If the facility fires high sulfur
coal and is equipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, then the estimated sorbent rate is
between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/MMacf to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lb</ENAMEX>/MMacf, without and with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJFF</ENAMEX>,
respectively. For a high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur coal</ENAMEX> application, humidification
would not be performed due to risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid condensation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 4-2</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">summarizes</ENAMEX> estimated injection rates for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> boiler under
various scenarios<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX> As shown, the injection rates vary
substantially based upon the circumstances.
Because combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> are expected to have high
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mercury</ENAMEX> removal due to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems, those facilities
that are so equipped are not expected to add <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> systems.
There are really no synergies in consumption if multiple ACI
units are installed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site. Therefore, the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>
consumption at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> will be roughly proportional to the total
plant capacity equipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>.

Construction equipment needed for installation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system
includes standard construction equipment - welders, excavation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>, concrete pouring equipment, cranes, etc. Since an ACI
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is much smaller and uses substantially less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> than an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> or FGD system, cranes and other lifting equipment can be of low
to moderate lifting capacity. Blowers, the sorbent storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">silo</ENAMEX>,
and other equipment will be mounted on concrete pads or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundations</ENAMEX>. In most cases, the sorbent storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">silo</ENAMEX> will be field
erected; however, for some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that require less sorbent, a
smaller, prefabricated silo may be installed. Steel erection and
minor excavation and concrete work is necessary for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system,
and this work should not require any more than very common
construction equipment. Piping for sorbent transport will typically
be welded steel and can be erected in the field in many cases. It
should not be necessary to relocate any existing boiler equipment
to install an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system. Therefore, the construction effort and
need for equipment is relatively modest compared to the more
involved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> projects.

Implementation of a control technology at a plant involves
several activities contingent upon each other. These activities may
be grouped under the following phases of an implementation project:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) conducting an engineering review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> and awarding a
procurement contract; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) obtaining a construction permit; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
installing the control technology; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) obtaining an operating
permit.
Exhibit A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Appendix A</ENAMEX> depicts the timeline expected for
completing a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>. Completion of some of
the activities is contingent upon completion of other activities.
For example, construction activities cannot commence until a
construction permit is obtained. In general, the ACI implementation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timeline</ENAMEX> appears to be driven primarily by the engineering
activities (i.e., design, fabrication, and construction).

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bÃ¥Ã–Ã¡Ã¥Ã‰Ã‰ÃªÃ¡Ã¥Ã–=oÃ‰Ã®Ã¡Ã‰Ã¯</ENAMEX>
As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-5</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of
technology implementation, an engineering review and assessment of
the combustion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, is conducted to determine the preferred
compliance alternative. During this phase, the specifications of
the control technology are determined and bids are requested from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>. After negotiating the bids, a contract for
implementing the control technology is awarded. The time necessary
to complete this phase is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">`Ã§Ã¥Ã­ÃªÃ§Ã¤=qÃ‰Ã…ÃœÃ¥Ã§Ã¤Ã§Ã–Ã³=fÃ¥Ã«Ã­~Ã¤Ã¤~Ã­Ã¡Ã§Ã</ENAMEX>¥
In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase, the control technology is installed. This
installation includes designing, fabricating, and installing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology. In addition, compliance testing of the control
technology is also completed in this phase. Most of the
construction activities, such as earthwork, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, process
electrical and control tie-ins to existing items, can occur while
the boiler is in operation. The time needed to complete this phase
of an implementation project is expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than three</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>.33
An important element of the overall control technology
implementation is the time needed to connect, or hook up, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology equipment to the combustion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. As a result of
the minimal mechanical interface between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorbent</ENAMEX> injection
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and the boiler, retrofit of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> will typically
require a fairly short outage - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less.33,34</NUMEX> This brief
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outage</ENAMEX> is necessary to install injection hardware and to make any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> system connections that may be necessary between the ACI
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and the boiler control. Other equipment associated with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system can be installed with the boiler on line, as it does not
require any interfacing with the boiler and should not require
moving any essential boiler equipment.
It should be possible to complete a project in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 4</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> from receipt of order<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.34</NUMEX> If construction and operating
permits are included in the analysis, the project is likely to take
longer than would be necessary only for engineering, supply,
installation, and startup of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system. This is because the
permitting activities might become the time-limiting steps. In some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">localities</ENAMEX>, it is possible that the permitting activities will not
be the limiting steps. In this case, a faster execution is possible
than shown on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-5</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix A.</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lÃ©Ã‰Ãª~Ã­Ã¡Ã¥Ã–=mÃ‰ÃªÃ£Ã¡Ã­</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facilities</ENAMEX> will also need to modify their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating
permit to incorporate the added control devices and the associated
reduced emission limits. In some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, an interim air-operating
permit may need to be obtained until the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX> V permit is
modified. The operating permit modification process consists of
preparation and submission of the application to the appropriate
state or local regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-5</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Appendix A</ENAMEX>, this process can occur simultaneously with the
processing of the construction permit application. The process of
transitioning from the construction permit to the operating permit
varies among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and appears to be somewhat unclear due to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infancy of the Title</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> operating permit process. Nonetheless, based
on discussions with several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, the application review process
is estimated to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 38 weeks</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9-10 months</TIMEX>). The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title</ENAMEX> V operating permit must also be made available for public
comment and is not made final until compliance testing on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> device is completed. Therefore, the total estimated time to
modify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Title V</ENAMEX> operating permit is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>, plus the
additional time to complete compliance testing<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>
Based on the estimated time periods needed to complete each of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phases described above, the estimated time period to
complete the implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> combustion unit is about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 months</TIMEX>, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-5</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix A.</ENAMEX> Since the
permitting process limits the timeline, a faster permitting process
will shorten the time necessary to install <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> on a single
unit.
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> does not expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> will be
implemented at many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> due to the co-benefit of mercury
removal from other control technologies. For those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> ACI retrofits will occur, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s projections reflect that
these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> will either have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 2</NUMEX> boilers retrofit per site.
Exhibit A-6 in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A examines a schedule for retrofitting a
facility with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> retrofits. This examines the
installation of the control device hook-up on a sequential basis.
Installation is staggered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> between sequential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to
enable more efficient utilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manpower</ENAMEX> and project
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> than if multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were connected at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time. This
approach requires a total time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 months</TIMEX>.
In summary, the total time needed to complete the design,
installation, and testing at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> unit is about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 months</TIMEX>, at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 16</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. Based on these timelines, it is estimated that, in
principle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> controls needed to comply with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multipollutant</ENAMEX> strategy can be met provided that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an adequate
supply of materials and labor is available and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the control
technology implementation process begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 16 months</TIMEX> prior
to the date controls must be in place. However, ideally, longer
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 months</TIMEX> would allow retrofits to occur over a period of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> can properly plan outages and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> can properly plan for resource availability. Erection of
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJFF</ENAMEX> would typically take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 to 20 months</TIMEX> from award of contract
to start up<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> If <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months</TIMEX> is added for pre-contract effort and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> is provided for start up and commissioning, the total
project duration would be anywhere from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 21 months to 26</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s modeling under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> projects
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> will not be installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJFFs</ENAMEX>.36

In summary, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> boiler firing eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bituminous coal</ENAMEX> with
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6 percent</NUMEX> sulfur, an ESP, and no SCR or FGD, is estimated to
provide the performance and require the resources listed in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> column of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4-4</ENAMEX>, and estimates of performance and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> needed for other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> and boiler configurations
are shown in the other columns. A boiler firing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">subbituminous</NUMEX> coal
and with only an ESP for particle collection and pollution control
will require the most activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> consumption and the most
steel for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4-5</ENAMEX> shows the estimated performance
and resources needed for a single and multiple (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>) ACI retrofit
on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> boiler firing subbituminous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> and equipped with an
ESP. As shown, as long as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 16 months</TIMEX> are provided for
installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> control technology,
then there should be sufficient time for the technology to be
installed. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facility owner</ENAMEX> chose to install a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pulse-Jet Fabric</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filter</ENAMEX> (PJFF) in addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system for the purpose of
improving sorbent utilization, the project time would necessarily
be lengthened beyond this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-month period</TIMEX> to allow for the
installation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJFF</ENAMEX>. As stated in section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX>, the total
duration for a PJFF retrofit is estimated to be anywhere from about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 months to 26 months</TIMEX>, including pre-contract effort and start up
and commissioning. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> provides much more
than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 months</TIMEX> of notice for any mercury control regulation, there
should be adequate time for compliance even if some facilities
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">install PJFFs</ENAMEX>.

Most of the equipment and piping associated with a sorbent
injection system is fairly small and can be easily accommodated on
any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. The only piece of equipment that could potentially be
a challenge to locate on site is the sorbent storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">silo</ENAMEX>, the
other equipment largely being piping and a blower. The storage silo
is, by far, the largest part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system. It is estimated
that a storage silo that is sized for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> storage at full
load for a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> firing bituminous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> and with only an

boilers with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX> filters, the size of the silo would be less
because of the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorbent</ENAMEX> injection rate. Some facility
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> may choose to install a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJFF</ENAMEX> in order to reduce sorbent
consumption and to segregate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> from the ash. In this case,
more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> would be needed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PJFF</ENAMEX>. The dimensions for a PJFF
on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> would be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 62 feet</NUMEX> wide x <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">92 feet</NUMEX> long x

This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> will explore the combination of these technologies
and how deployment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> technology at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> could
potentially result in improved resource utilization. It is assumed
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> would not be necessary at a single unit
because of the high mercury removal efficiencies expected through
combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>. Hence, the synergies of combining all
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> technologies were not explored.

In some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> may choose to retrofit their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and FGD technology to achieve both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> and SO2
reduction. Combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> will also result in
significant reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury emissions</ENAMEX>, thereby mitigating the
need for the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>. However, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> are very
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">capital-intensive</ENAMEX> projects, which require a substantial level of
material and construction. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider
if both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations can be combined efficiently.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> project involves retrofitting in the boiler and its
immediate area. Therefore, an SCR retrofit project may require
relocation of equipment in the boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system is
installed farther downstream in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, after the ESP.
Occasionally, it is necessary to install a new smoke stack, and it
may be necessary to add more fan capacity. However, an additional
smoke stack is normally unnecessary. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> connection with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facility</ENAMEX> is generally less difficult than with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> because it does
not require modification of the boiler, just connection to ductwork
in the vicinity of the stack. As a result, the construction
activities would normally be in different locations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>,
reducing the interference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> projects. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> might
be the limiting item on the boiler outage because of its more
complex connection. In any event, the tie-in of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and the FGD
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> could be done in the same outage, and it has been confirmed
that the installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and scrubber could be performed
simultaneously without interference<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>, installing these
at the same time on a boiler is preferable to doing them separately
as they may be able to use the same outage, and project
efficiencies result from a single mobilization, a single
construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, and sharing of large construction equipment
for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> projects. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas City Power</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Light</ENAMEX>'s Hawthorn
Power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unit 5</ENAMEX> was replaced (excluding turbine) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">under 22</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. This included the boiler, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSD/FF</ENAMEX>.38
Although, in this case the equipment did not have to be erected
adjacent to an operating boiler, the erection included demolishing
and erecting a complete boiler <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and demolishing the existing
electrostatic precipitator. Hence, this was a very complex project
that was completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> within the time frame estimated
and shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-7</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix A.</ENAMEX>

As noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4, ACI</ENAMEX> entails a much smaller construction
project than either an FGD or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> is located
in a different part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> or SCR and activated
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> injection occurrs in the ductwork between the air preheater
and the ESP or FF. One benefit of combining
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> projects is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> hookup can be completed
during the outage for the scrubber hookup, since the installation
effort necessary for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> will far outweigh that of the ACI
system. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> benefit is better planning of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> storage and
handling equipment. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> require a substantial amount
of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> (limestone and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX>, respectively) and associated storage
and handling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. Installing both technologies at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> will permit better planning of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> storage and equipment
locations, thereby avoiding interference. Other benefits, such as a
single mobilization, a single construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, and sharing of
large construction equipment for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> projects exist, but they
are not expected to make a significant difference due to the
difference in size between the portions of the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> and ACI
project. Therefore, as shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exhibit A-8</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Appendix</ENAMEX> A, the
schedule for a combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> project is expected to be the
same as the schedule of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> project.

As noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4, ACI</ENAMEX> entails a much smaller construction

Having assessed the resource requirements for individual or
multiple retrofits of control technologies, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> will
assess the resource availability in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for retrofit
of control technologies for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. This analysis
considers the current availability of resources for the
construction of control technologies and does not consider any
potential increase in production of resources due to the demand
created by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. Because this effect will be more
pronounced in the period following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> and because other market
factors may also change over time, the longer term projections are
of less value than those out to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> has made preliminary
estimates of the retrofits of each technology that would result
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 6-1a</ENAMEX>, b, and c list the expected
total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that would be equipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> after response to a multipollutant rule. It is important to
note that the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Current Air Quality Rule Retrofit MWe</ENAMEX>" row of the
table includes only the projected retrofits under the current air
quality rules. The control technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retrofits</ENAMEX> estimated to result
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>, including the retrofits from current air
quality rules, is listed in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Multipollutant & Current</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retrofits MWe</ENAMEX>" row of the tables. The "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cumulative Total</ENAMEX>" MWe shown
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-1</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that currently are equipped with
the technology or are expected to be equipped with the technology
as a result of current air quality rules, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SCRs</ENAMEX> resulting
from the NOX SIP Call as well as the projected retrofits under the
Clear Skies Act. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> would
result from the NOX SIP Call and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWe</ENAMEX> from
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> multipollutant rules with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 14</NUMEX> GWe
currently installed. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> are responding to the NOX
SIP Call at this time and it is uncertain exactly how many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> will ultimately be equipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> when the
NOX SIP Call deadline arrives.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> projections estimate that it would be cost effective for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> retrofits to be installed under the Clear Skies
Act by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> even though the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SO2</NUMEX> cap is not in
effect until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. These retrofits would be early installations
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> initiate due to the economic benefits of banking SO2
allowances. It is estimated that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of FGD
capacity being constructed or just recently completed. Based on
availability of resources, particularly labor, it is projected that
an additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> capacity could be built for a total
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> estimate based on
availability of resources is much less than the amount of FGD
capacity that would be cost effective to build, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> ran model
sensitivities constraining the amount of scrubber capacity that
could be installed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>. This estimate for the
potential number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retrofits</ENAMEX> considers the resource and labor
requirements of the simultaneous installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCRs</ENAMEX>, which is
further discussed under the labor section (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.2</NUMEX>) of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,000</NUMEX> MWe difference, between the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGDs</ENAMEX> which would
be cost effective to build and the estimated number based on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, would be pushed back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> to be completed by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. Therefore, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> retrofits projected to be
built by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> for Clear Skies and current requirements remains the
same under both scenarios. It is likely that additional FGD
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrofits</ENAMEX> could be completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>, but there would be the
potential for an increase in the cost of construction due to
decreased implementation time.
A typical unit size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> was selected for each technology.
In previous sections, capacity factors of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> were assumed.
In reality, coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, on average, have lower capacity
factors. For example, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.8 percent</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">786 GWe</NUMEX> of
generating capacity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">313</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>, was coal fueled. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that same year</TIMEX>, coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> produced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 51 percent</NUMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,691 billion kWh</NUMEX>, or
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,882 billion kWh.39</NUMEX> This corresponds to a capacity factor of
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68.7 percent</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Information Administration</ENAMEX> Web
Site; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capacity Factor</ENAMEX> is total MWe-h produced divided by the total
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>-h that would be produced if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> were run at full capacity
for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,760</NUMEX> h in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>). As a result, assuming a capacity factor
of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> will result in a much more conservative (high)
estimate of resources needed than is likely to be the case.
In estimating the resources necessary to put new control
technology capacity in place (labor, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, etc.), the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Multipollutant & Current Rule Retrofits MWe</ENAMEX>" values of Tables
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-1a</ENAMEX>, b and c are of greatest interest. For estimating the
consumables necessary for the technologies, such as limestone,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ammonia</ENAMEX>, catalyst, or activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>, the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cumulative Total MWe</ENAMEX>"
value is most important. The multipollutant and total MWe of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> technology retrofits are given for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005, 2010, 2015</TIMEX>, and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. To provide a conservative estimate of required resources, the
following analysis looks at implementing the retrofits for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 months</TIMEX> prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> and retrofits for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010, 2015</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> prior to each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> period. For example, it
estimates the resource requirements from the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2005</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> instead of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirty-one months</TIMEX> was used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>, because the analysis for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>
was based on the projected number of retrofits needed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>, less
the amount of capacity installed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2002</TIMEX>. It should also be
noted that most of the retrofits needed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> are being installed
to meet existing requirements under the NOX SIP Call or other
regulatory requirements as opposed to the requirements of a
multipollutant program such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>.

The hardware items such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, piping, nozzles, pumps, soot
blowers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> packing, and related equipment required for a
typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, or ACI systems installation are used in large
industries such as construction, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> production, auto
production, and power production. Consequently, installation of
these technologies on many coal-fired utility boilers is not
expected to result in severe changes in demand for the hardware
items listed.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 1,125 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> is needed for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe FGD</ENAMEX> system, which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2.25 tons</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>. This is
conservatively high since there are some significant synergies
possible when there are multiple units on site. In particular, two
boilers with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">900 MWe</NUMEX> of capacity require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 2.1 tons</NUMEX> per
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 3</ENAMEX>, an SCR for a coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> boiler
requires <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly 2.5 tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> for the typical size.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 MWe</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> will need <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 175 tons</NUMEX> of
steel to install an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 0.35 tons</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX>.
Estimated steel requirements for the projected retrofit MWe are
shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-2</ENAMEX> assuming that the retrofits occur over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 months</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior to 2005</TIMEX> and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010, 2015</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retrofits</ENAMEX> starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> facility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are likely to have
more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> to complete this work as many of these
retrofits have already begun. These time periods were chosen to
show that even under short periods of time, no significant impact
to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> supply is expected.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> data on=<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> steel shipments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> was
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">108,703,000 tons</NUMEX>, and imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,993,000</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> for a total demand of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 140 million tons</NUMEX>. An assumed
growth rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> steel demand was chosen at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX>, a typical
number for growth in GDP. For each increment of time, the impact to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> steel demand was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one tenth</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percent. Even if
there were no growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> steel production and imports from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> out to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>, the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> needed to complete the
retrofits for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> would still be less than one
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tenth</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> production including imports.
Similarly, available supplies of piping, nozzles, pumps, soot
blowers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>, and other related standard component necessary for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> installations are not expected to present
constraints on the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to install the technology.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> is the only specialized piece of equipment that is

The installation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> control technologies
will require the following types of labor:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€¢</ENAMEX> general construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for site preparation and storage
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility installation</ENAMEX>;
â€¢ skilled metal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for specialized metal and/or other
material assembly and construction; â€¢ other skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> such as
boilermakers, electricians, pipe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fitters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, and truck
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>; and
â€¢ unskilled labor to assist with hauling of materials, placing
of catalyst elements, and clean up.
From <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>, it takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 760</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> of labor per MWe
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> built. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 3</ENAMEX> showed that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 700 man-hours</TIMEX> of labor
per MWe are required for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> system on a coal-fired boiler, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX> showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 10</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> of labor are needed per
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system. Using these factors and the expected
retrofits, the labor requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> retrofits
can be determined and are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-3</ENAMEX>. These estimates do
not take into account any synergies or efficiencies realized from
retrofitting multiple units on a site, as are described in Section
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 and 3.5</NUMEX>, or from a combination of technologies, as described in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> project <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
percent of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> project man-hours are for boilermakers.40 There
is little data on ACI breakdown of labor; however, a conservative
level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> is assumed. Using these rates and assuming the
above mentioned construction periods, it is possible to estimate
the number of fully employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> and boilermakers. The results
are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-3</ENAMEX>. The actual annual requirement for labor
would be less if the estimated number of retrofit installations
were evenly distributed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the full five-year</TIMEX> increment of time
instead of the conservative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> increment.

Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> shows a summary of construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> labor

<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.7 percent</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.0 percent</NUMEX> annualized) for the economy as a whole.
The unemployment rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.4 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> compares to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>
percent for the whole economy.41

The available construction labor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6.7</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>, will provide a large labor pool for the trades that are
not unique to the power industry, such as iron and steel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pipe</ENAMEX> fitters, and electricians. In other words, that the estimated
demand of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under 20,000</NUMEX> full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 0.3</NUMEX>
percent of the current total labor pool.
Boilermakers are a skilled labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> that is fairly unique to
utility work. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Sixty percent</NUMEX> of the demand for boilermakers in the
construction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> is from the utility industry<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX> Other
industries requiring boilermaker labor include <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refinery</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
percent), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX>), paper (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>
percent). These are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX> where boilers and high-energy
vessels are most likely to be found. Retrofit of equipment on
utility boilers often requires a significant number of boilermakers
due to the integration that is needed with the boiler that often
requires modification of steam piping or other boiler equipment.
Also, in response to the increase in demand for boilermakers over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few years</TIMEX>, their ranks have increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,444</NUMEX> active
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,587</NUMEX>* <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> - an annualized growth
rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 percent</NUMEX>.31 Employment level also increased during this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69.8 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81.8 percent</NUMEX> (employment level is equal
to the total <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> worked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> divided by total active
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2080 h/yr</ENAMEX>). During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">much of the 1990</TIMEX>'s the number of
active boilermakers had been declining due to very low employment
levels resulting from very low activity in the utility power plant
construction business<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>, the increased activity of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few years</TIMEX> has been a welcome change to boilermakers.
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> have mentioned that the availability of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boilermakers</ENAMEX> has been tight for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> projects underway for the
NOX SIP Call<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.42</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> However, where shortages have been experienced
in manning SCR construction projects with adequate numbers of
boilermakers, manpower planning had been done with short notice<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX>
Many boilermakers travel to work sites that are out of their local
area. A large project may require mobilization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boilermakers</ENAMEX> to a site, which will frequently require pulling
* It is assumed that this number is for journeyman boilermakers
and does not include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in apprenticeship programs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the current</TIMEX>,
competitive environment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX>, power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are
reluctant to provide much advance notice of when outages will
occur. Therefore, in some cases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> must find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manpower</ENAMEX> on
very short notice. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boilermaker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blacksmiths</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forgers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helpers</ENAMEX>) attempts to provide the necessary manpower to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>. However, with very short notice, it is sometimes
difficult to move the manpower to the site in the short time
desired. Nevertheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> has been successful in providing
sufficient manpower to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">project sites</ENAMEX> where they have had
adequate advance notice<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>, although there is little
slack in the availability of boilermakers, better coordination may
have avoided the labor shortage problems.
It is worthwhile to consider the expected future <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the
supply of boilermakers. The total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boilermaker</ENAMEX>'s construction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> is currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 24,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journeymen</ENAMEX> and apprentices.44 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. These numbers are up from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>'s when a severe drought
of work for boilermakers caused many boilermakers to seek other
lines of work. Due to the current workload, the boilermaker ranks
are growing. However, the average age of the work force is about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>. Because of the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> and because of the anticipated
demand for work at power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> has made it an objective
to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 28,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the construction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least a 5.3 percent</NUMEX> annual growth rate. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boilermaker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> is working to recruit new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> into their
apprenticeship programs, which takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> to complete. Also,
skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from other trades may choose to work as a
boilermaker, so a shorter apprenticeship may be possible, depending
upon the experience and skill level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. For example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">steelworkers</ENAMEX> who had been boilermakers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> could
move back into boilermaker work very quickly. Since, boilermakers
earn somewhat more than ironworkers,42 it is reasonable to expect
that with increased job stability in the boilermaker trade, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ironworkers</ENAMEX> might choose to move to the boilermaker trade for the
higher pay, especially if they had worked as boilermakers in the
past. The iron and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steelworkers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150,000</NUMEX> members<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.45</NUMEX> Even
without prior boilermaker experience, some of these iron and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steelworkers</ENAMEX> could choose to move to boilermakers with much less
than a full <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-year</TIMEX> training requirement because of their
knowledge and skill level. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boilermaker</ENAMEX>'s
shipbuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30,000</NUMEX> members45 who, depending
upon industry conditions, could move over to the construction
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> quickly.
As noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the number of boilermakers dropped quickly
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> when little work was available. Conversely,
increasing demand for boilermakers that would result from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multipollutant</ENAMEX> rule should stimulate more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to enter the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>. The overall employment outlook for boilermakers should be
quite good, considering the work created by a multipollutant
initiative and the work on new power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that is projected over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 20 years</TIMEX>. As stated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy Policy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">May</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>):
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 20 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> will need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1300 to 1900</TIMEX>
new power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Electricity demand is expected to increase at a
rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 percent</NUMEX> per year over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 20 years</TIMEX>, creating the
need for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">393,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of generating capacity. At a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5 percent</NUMEX>
growth rate that number is reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 60,000 to 66,000</NUMEX> MWe
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 330,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> of new generating capacity.
A large quantity of new generating capacity, consisting mostly
of gas combined cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, has been built within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last several</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, close to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 GWe</NUMEX> of new capacity have been built
or is currently under construction with an even larger quantity
being proposed. This excess in capacity is projected to create an
overall reserve margin <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 25 percent</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next few years</TIMEX>. By comparison, this is a significant increase in
the reserve margin since it dipped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 10 percent</NUMEX> in the late
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>'s. As the demand in electricity grows, the need for new
generating capacity will not be felt
until the excess capacity is worked off. Assuming new capacity
will be needed when the reserve margin approaches <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX>, it is
expected to push back the need for additional capacity beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>
and in some regions as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as 2010</TIMEX>.
Due to the installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> for the NOX SIP Call, a
significant percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boilermakers</ENAMEX> who are currently
working in the utility industry would be needed to complete those
retrofits by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Planning</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX> (IPM) projections
indicate that it would be cost effective to install <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWe</ENAMEX> of
scrubbers by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> in addition to the projected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations;
however, boilermaker labor is not expected to be sufficient to meet
this demand even if their numbers grow at the projected <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 percent</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> growth rate. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.2</NUMEX> shows the boilermaker labor
requirements out to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> assuming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> GWe of scrubbers and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWe</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations are installed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> and compares the demand to
the supply of labor.

Assuming that the boilermaker membership grows at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 percent</NUMEX>
growth rate out to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>, it is estimated that there will be
sufficient new boilermaker labor to complete <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 10</TIMEX> GWe
of scrubber retrofits by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. Considering that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 GWe</NUMEX> of scrubber
capacity is either being built or recently constructed, it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conservatively</ENAMEX> assumed than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 6</NUMEX> GWe could be completed
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. This estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWe</ENAMEX> of scrubber retrofits by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> was
determined from the difference between the boilermaker <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">labor hours</TIMEX>
available from the boilermaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> working in the electric
utility industry and the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">labor hours</TIMEX> needed to complete control
technology retrofits and other electric utility projects. This
estimate is supported by the number of orders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGDs</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> and
projected orders through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> by the electric utility industry,
which totals over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 GWe46</TIMEX>, and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> GWe of announced scrubbers
which are scheduled to start up by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. Orders for scrubbers, such
as the recent order for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Coleman Station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, are
continuing to be received in spite of the concerns raised about the
availability of boilermaker labor during the simultaneous
installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCRs</ENAMEX> for the NOX SIP Call. The other electric
utility projects that boilermakers work on include such projects as
routine maintenance at operating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> construction,
which account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 13,500,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">man-hours</TIMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boilermaker</ENAMEX> labor per year<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX> Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-3 compares the available
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boilermaker</ENAMEX> labor to the demand from the electric utility industry
which includes the retrofits from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX>.

Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boilermakers</ENAMEX> earn more money than most other craft
trades42 and the demand for boilermakers should be steady and
increasing, it is reasonable to expect that the growth in
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">boilermaker</ENAMEX> numbers experienced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these last few years</TIMEX> should
continue for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many more years</TIMEX>. To assess the impact of this, it was
assumed that the boilermakers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> continued to grow at the
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 percent</NUMEX> pace that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Brotherhood of</ENAMEX>
Boilermakers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron Ship Builders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blacksmiths, Forgers</ENAMEX>, and Helpers
has set as a minimum growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. Based upon the estimates of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-3</ENAMEX> and the assumed growth rates, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> boilermaker
demand created by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clean Skies Act</ENAMEX> can be estimated and is shown
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-4</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-4</ENAMEX> was derived considering that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 GWe</TIMEX> of SCRs
have already been installed for the NOX SIP Call, so the remaining
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">71 GWe</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWe</ENAMEX> of scrubber installations were considered
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-4</ENAMEX>, if the retrofit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> systems for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> occur over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty-one months</TIMEX> prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>
and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a three-year</TIMEX> period for each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> increment after
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005 to 2020</TIMEX>, the maximum demand would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 23 percent</NUMEX> of the
journeyman boilermakers or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 19 percent</NUMEX> for journeymen and
apprentices combined.
Considering only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boilermakers</ENAMEX> who are currently in demand by
the utility industry, the demand would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 38 percent</NUMEX> of the
journeyman boilermakers or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 31 percent</NUMEX> for journeymen and
apprentices combined. These percentages of demand are expected to
be experienced prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, but with growth in the boilermaker
numbers out to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, the percent of boilermakers affected drops
off. The number of boilermakers in demand for retrofit
installations under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> is spread fairly evenly out
to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> when the demand begins to decrease. However, there may
still be significant demand for boilermakers after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> from other
power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> construction programs.

The actual impact on the demand for boilermakers could be lower
for several reasons. Due to the longer increments of time that the
Clear Skies <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> provides <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> to comply than was assumed
in this analysis, installation of these technologies will extend
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three years</TIMEX>, spreading out the demand. As stated
earlier, this analysis does not consider any of the synergies or
efficiencies that have been demonstrated to occur on multiple unit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrofits</ENAMEX> or multiple-technology retrofits. The boilermaker
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> has been growing at a faster rate- <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 percent</NUMEX> annually
- in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>'s minimum target of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 percent</NUMEX>
that was assumed. Therefore, the number of boilermakers may
actually grow more quickly than what was assumed. This analysis
also neglects overtime, which would reduce the demand for workers
somewhat.

Most of the construction equipment necessary for the
installation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, and ACI technology is standard
construction equipment that is used for most construction
activities. The piece of equipment that is not standard that may be
needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCRs</ENAMEX> and possibly for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems is a tall-span
heavy-lift <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crane</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> are necessary to lift heavy pieces
(sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 100 tons</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> feet and are not needed
for all projects. When the largest piece to be lifted is determined
from the construction plan, the necessary crane can be determined.
In some cases, the available crane or the crane pricing may limit
the largest piece to be lifted, and the construction plan may be
modified to accommodate a smaller crane by lifting smaller pieces.
In many instances, the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crane</ENAMEX> for the job is
not the largest because the large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX> are very expensive to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rent</ENAMEX> (one size up could double or triple the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> charges for
renting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the crane30</TIMEX>). As a result, it may be more cost effective
overall to use a smaller crane and lift smaller pieces. This may
lengthen the installation time slightly, but it will reduce crane
rental fees. Therefore, an economic trade off must be assessed for
each project.
As discussed in Section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX>, utility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> reported that
while installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCRs</ENAMEX> for the NOX SIP Call, crane availability has
been an issue that can be accommodated with proper planning. The
construction plan could be modified to employ the available or most
cost-effective crane. Therefore, sufficient supply of construction
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> is expected to be available for installing air pollution
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> equipment.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 90,000</NUMEX> m3/yr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-7</ENAMEX> shows the results of a survey of
major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> catalyst to coal-fired boilers. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> provided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> their current capacity and the capacity that
will be on line in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2002</TIMEX>. The estimated capacity of other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> of catalyst to coal-fired boilers that could not be
reached in time for this study is listed also. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Suppliers</ENAMEX> that have
offered catalyst for coal applications in the past but currently
focus strictly on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> -fired applications were not
included. However, it is recognized that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> could
shift their product mix if the market conditions justified it, so
the capacity value shown could be quickly increased if
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> simply changed product focus.
The current capacity was originally built overseas to meet
overseas demand or was subsequently built to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand for
catalyst spurred by the NOX SIP Call and the build up of gas
turbine power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S. Except</ENAMEX> for a moderate demand for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement catalyst</ENAMEX>, much of this capacity will be available after
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> because these large demand peaks will have mostly passed.
Because most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that supply <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> are divisions of
very large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> with the resources to rapidly expand their
manufacturing capacity to meet increases in market demand, it is
reasonable to assume that this manufacturing capacity could be
expanded if the market demand justified it. In fact, recent
capacity expansions provide strong evidence of this.

Currently, the equivalent of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 GWe</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>,
and gas-fired capacity worldwide utilizes SCR technology. At these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX> installations, the volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> in use is
estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 55,000 to 95,000</NUMEX> m3.10 Assuming that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-twelfth of the current catalyst is
replaced each year on average, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> demand for replacement
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 5,000 to 8,000</NUMEX> m3/yr. Note that the
estimate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the current annual</TIMEX> demand is quite conservative since
the catalyst replacement rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>- and gas-fired combustion
units is likely to be less frequent than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-twelfth of the
catalyst per year. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>, an additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">85 GWe</TIMEX> of coal-fired SCR
capacity is expected to be on line in response to the NOX SIP Call
and recently promulgated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> rules (this includes anticipated SCR
retrofits under the state rules for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>). Assuming conservatively that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-eighth</NUMEX> of the catalyst is
replaced each year on average for coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, the annual
demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> SCR catalyst would increase by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,600</NUMEX> m3/yr
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. Adding the current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> replacement demand from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX> installations to the projected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> replacement demand
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> would yield a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,600</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,600</NUMEX>
m3/yr demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement catalyst</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2005.10</NUMEX>
The estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> from the Clear Skies
Act, which consists of the demand due to new installations and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> replacement is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-8</ENAMEX>. The highest catalyst
demand will occur by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-7</ENAMEX>, the estimated capacity
of catalyst supply is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87,300</NUMEX> m3/yr. Considering the initial fill
demand of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,000</NUMEX> m3/yr from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations and
replacement demand of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,300</NUMEX> m3/yr from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 GWe</NUMEX> of cumulative SCR
installations plus the worldwide catalyst replacement demand of
between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000 and 8,000</NUMEX> m3/yr, the annual excess capacity is
estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31,000 to 34,000 m3</NUMEX>/yr. A more conservative
approach to determining if there is sufficient catalyst supply to
meet the demand from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> is demonstrated in Figure
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-4</ENAMEX>. It compares the current cumulative production capacity for SCR
catalyst to the cumulative <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> from the
total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005 and 2010</TIMEX>. This approach assumes
that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> continues at the current
level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87,300</NUMEX> m3/yr and starts accumulating in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2002</TIMEX>. If all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> systems were loaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> in just a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> period
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior to 2005 and 2010</TIMEX> instead of spreading out the loading over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>, there would be sufficient accumulated supply to meet
the increased demand.

Utility power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are already installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> catalyst for the
purpose of NOX SIP Call compliance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>. As shown in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-4,</ENAMEX>
the cumulative demand from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> plus the worldwide
demand can be met with the total cumulative confirmed capacity.
Consequently, adequate capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> catalyst supply is available
to satisfy the demand that may result from the projected
installations. Of course, as demonstrated by the catalyst
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, if more capacity was desirable to satisfy the market, it
could be added given sufficient lead time for the construction of
the catalyst production <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.
The ability to retrofit a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> systems over a
short period of time was exemplified in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> during the late
1980s. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> shows the number of systems installed over an
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-year</TIMEX> period, with most of these systems (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137</NUMEX>) installed
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two consecutive years</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989-1990</TIMEX>). This pattern of
installations exhibits that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">catalyst market</ENAMEX> demonstrated the
ability to respond to the surge in demand resulting from a dramatic
increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> and operation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> systems is not expected to
be constrained by the future availability of ammonia or urea. The
production of anhydrous ammonia in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> was
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17,400,000 tons</NUMEX> (equivalent anhydrous) with apparent
consumption of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22,000,000 tons</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,600,000</NUMEX> met through net
imports, as shown in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Geological Survey</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minerals Commodity Summaries</ENAMEX>. Ammonia demand is directly
proportional to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> reduced. The increased ammonia
demand from a multipollutant rule is estimated to increase to about
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,040,000 tons</NUMEX> per year by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. This <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> increase in demand
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a nearly 20-year period</TIMEX> can easily be met. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
and worldwide ammonia business is struggling because of slumping
domestic demand and increased global capacity for the product and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitrogen fertilizers</ENAMEX> derived from it, such as urea.
Nevertheless, more capacity is scheduled to come on in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
during the near future. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.2 million tons</NUMEX> of capacity
is being built in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX> and the former
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> have also added significant capacity. Another problem
is the withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">importer</ENAMEX> of ammonia. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>
traditionally bought <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 to 6 million tons</NUMEX> of urea <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> (which is
produced
from ammonia), but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> launched a drive to
become self-sufficient in urea, a move that has displaced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.7 million tons</NUMEX> of ammonia<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.47</NUMEX> Based on these estimates, the
ability to supply of ammonia will continue to exceed its demand,
even with the additional demand from newly installed SCR
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> systems can also use urea as a reagent, and it is becoming
preferred to ammonia in many cases because of its safety. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urea</ENAMEX> is a
commonly available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 11,760,000 tons</NUMEX> of
domestic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> production capacity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.48</NUMEX> For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> purposes, this adds
effectively another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.7 million tons</NUMEX> of ammonia <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> available
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> reagent.* <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Additionally</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> urea <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> routinely trade within a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">130,000,000 tons</NUMEX> worldwide
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> production capacity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> Based on total world urea trade,
increased demand due to a multipollutant regulation would be well
under <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> of world trade if all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SCRs</ENAMEX> used urea rather than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ammonia</ENAMEX>. And, like ammonia, the urea market is currently
experiencing an oversupply situation. Urea prices have fallen
precipitously since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, formerly a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX>, decided to
strive for self-sufficiency. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1994 to 1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> opened <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine</TIMEX>
new urea <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and raised its domestic production by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> knew <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> would bring on the new, more-efficient
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, but they did not expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to continue running
its smaller, less-efficient <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ones.48</NUMEX> Thus, it is expected that this
worldwide supply will provide additional flexibility in meeting any
significant increases in demand. Since urea production is performed
on a worldwide basis, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> producing urea would be able to expand
their capacity if needed. Based on these considerations, adequate
urea supply is expected to be available for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> systems.

dropping by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 percent</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">660/ton</TIMEX>. Therefore, growth in demand
experienced in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>'s has not been reflected in the value of

exports. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> are concentrating increasingly on the

depending upon how much growth occurs as a result of regulation,
additional capacity may be necessary. It would take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-3 years</TIMEX> to

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> estimated that, of the total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MWe</ENAMEX> to be retrofit by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>, all of that capacity would have existing fabric
filters. 36 As mentioned before, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s modeling indicates that none
of the total MWe of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> retrofits will include a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">PJFF.36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX> usage
nationally for mercury control from power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> should be roughly
proportional to the total MWe of coal-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that are
equipped with the technology (this assumes an average capacity
factor of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> and other assumptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 4-4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-5</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-9</ENAMEX> shows the results of this analysis. Based upon this
analysis, it is possible that existing excess capacity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>
production could adequately address the increased demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>.
And, even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> is more broadly used than anticipated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> (more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,300</NUMEX> MWe), it is clear that with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX>-3 years of
preparation time to build more production capacity the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> industry
can accommodate any additional demand.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clear Skies Act</ENAMEX> is expected to create jobs for those
directly involved in the retrofit of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. These have been
estimated in Section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.2</NUMEX> of this document. In addition to the jobs
that are directly created by this activity, jobs will be created
indirectly as a result of the economic activity that is stimulated
by additional discretionary income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> will have. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> that
are directly employed on these clean air projects will purchase
consumer goods and services, which will stimulate additional
economic activity. To account for these indirect effects of
economic activity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> use economic multipliers that are
related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s marginal propensity to consume. Economic
multipliers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 3</NUMEX> are often used<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.52</NUMEX> Using the lower multiplier
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and the total labor estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-3</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX> additional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jobs</ENAMEX> may be created through indirect economic activity (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> times the
peak direct labor level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6-3</ENAMEX>).
This effect does not consider the additional job-gain potential
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based equipment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> that export to other countries
the clean-air technology know-how they will gain from these
clean-air programs.

This report evaluated the resources necessary to comply with the
Clear Skies <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> estimated, by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX>, the
number, and size of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that will have to install new
hardware. The control technologies considered by this report as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to be used for this multipollutant control strategy
include:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â–  LSFO</ENAMEX> for the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SO2; â–  SCR</ENAMEX> for the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX>; and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â–  ACI</ENAMEX> for the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX>.
Based upon the IPM-generated information from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> and the
characteristics of the technologies listed above, the total
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> needed to comply with the multipollutant control strategy
were estimated and compared to the available resources. The
availability of resources was based on their current market demand
and does not reflect the increased production capacity that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multipollutant</ENAMEX> strategy may create. It is likely that the market
for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>, labor, construction equipment, and other resources
used in the construction and operation of air pollution control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> would respond by increasing production to meet demand
where needed.
Installation of wet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX>, specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSFO</ENAMEX>, presents a
conservatively high estimate of anticipated resources and time to
provide additional control of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SO2</ENAMEX> emissions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSFO</ENAMEX> systems commonly
are more resource intensive than many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> technologies.
Conservatively high assumptions were made for the time, labor,
reagents, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> needed to install <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems. Although FGD
installations are time and labor intensive, they are typically
planned and installed within normally scheduled outages. It is
expected that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 27 months</TIMEX> of total
effort for planning, engineering, installation and startup. Modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems typically use fewer and smaller absorbers and
increasingly control greater amounts of generating capacity using
common absorbers fed by multiple boilers. Under the Clear Skies
Act, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> absorber systems for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> boilers are anticipated to
handle <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,400 MWe</NUMEX> of capacity. The estimate of labor includes
planning and engineering, general labor, and skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boilermakers</ENAMEX>.
Construction of absorbers off-site is one way that projects can
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> project resources, schedules, and labor.
Steel is the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hardware component</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems.
Structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> is used primarily for the absorber, ductwork, and
supports, and secondarily in miscellaneous components including
reinforcement of existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems are
installed on the back end of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, are usually built close to
the ground, and do not require the amounts of structural steel
generally associated with elevated installations such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX>. By
comparison, the conservative estimate of the amount of steel
required for a full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> system is less than or equal to that
required for an SCR retrofit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrosion</ENAMEX> and abrasion resistant
materials are increasingly being applied with success in modern FGD
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> to improve reliability and long-term performance. The total
demand for additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations will be modest and is
expected to be well within the anticipated steel capacity, even
with demands from other applications.
Construction equipment requirements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations are
typically modest, particularly given that systems are installed at
the back end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> and close to the ground. However,
experience has indicated that project planning can surmount even
difficult situations (e.g., prefabrication and jacking up
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>). Experience has also shown that specific site issues,
while often a planning challenge, have not prevented installations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems. More recently, space requirements for construction
and accommodating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> have been addressed with the
implementation of improvements in technology, including fewer and
smaller absorbers and more efficient on-site use and treatment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX> and byproducts.
Limestone was used as an estimate of reagent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems.
Experience indicates that the quantity of limestone is
conservatively high compared to other enhanced reagents such as
fine-ground limestone and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MEL</ENAMEX>. Even with the assumption that all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">new FGD</ENAMEX> capacity will require limestone, the amount of limestone
needed as a reagent is projected to be within availability of
supply.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> is the technology that will primarily be used for NOX
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Since it is also the most demanding in terms of resources
needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, it was assumed to be the only technology
used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> control. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> systems are primarily made from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>,
standard mechanical hardware, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX>. Conservatively high
assumptions were made for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, catalyst, reagents, and the labor
and equipment necessary to install the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> projected by the IPM
that result from a multipollutant control strategy. The amount of
ammonia or urea reagent needed can be estimated with good
confidence as constituting a small portion of available supply.
Experience in installing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCRs</ENAMEX> for the NOX SIP Call has shown
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> equipment can be installed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> in the
space provided. In some cases, moving of equipment has been
necessary, but this has not proved to be limiting. The only
specialized construction equipment that can be useful for SCR
installations are tall, heavy-lift <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX>. These appear to be in
adequate supply and are not essential, since the erection plan can
be modified to accommodate the use of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes</ENAMEX>, which are
frequently more economical. The only specialized labor necessary
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> installations are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the boilermakers trade, and
estimates of boilermaker demand were made. It is expected that one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 21 months</TIMEX> of total effort for planning,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, and start-up. Experience has shown that
many installations have been completed in much shorter times.
Therefore, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 months</TIMEX> appears to be somewhat conservative.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> was presumed to be the technology that would be used to
reduce mercury where dedicated mercury controls were needed because
the hardware is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sorbent</ENAMEX> injection
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>. Also, other sorbent-based approaches in development
may prove in time to be preferable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX>, making the use of ACI
only a conservative assumption. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> hardware is comprised of
relatively common mechanical components and is largely made of
steel. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> requires much less in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, labor,
or other resources to install than either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FGD</ENAMEX> or SCR technology.
Therefore, the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> hardware on resource demand is much
less than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> or SCR technologies for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SO2</TIMEX> or NOX control,
respectively. The only piece of equipment of any consequence in
terms of size is the storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">silo</ENAMEX>, and this piece of equipment is
not so large as to pose a problem with regard to location for most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning</ENAMEX>, engineering, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, and start-up of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACI</ENAMEX> system is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only about 15 months</TIMEX> and could be done in much less
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> if administrative matters, such as permitting, occur more
quickly than assumed. Figures for consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> were based on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior</TIMEX>, peer-reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> work, and conservative operating
conditions were assumed.
In summary, this study found that the expected demand for
resources resulting from a multipollutant control strategy could be
met. However, the market is expected to adjust to changes in both
the demand for resources under a multipollutant program and other
market factors. For this reason, the longer term
projections are of less value than those for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005 and 2010</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> period. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7-1</ENAMEX> shows a summary of resource demand and its
effect on current supply. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7-1</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supply Basis</ENAMEX> may be
current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand, capacity available to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, or other
basis as appropriate and described in the table notes. For all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX>, it is assumed that these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> are required over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31-month</TIMEX> period prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> and a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> period prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010, 2015</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>. This is a very
conservative assumption because the most complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> installations
will require <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> while the actual available time to
complete the projected retrofits for each period, except prior to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>.
As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7-1</ENAMEX>, there is ample steel and general
construction labor to support the installation of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>, assuming a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31-month</TIMEX> period of installation prior to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005 and a three-year</TIMEX> installation prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010, 2015</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>.
Moreover, the demand assumptions do not consider any efficiencies
that can be achieved at multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> installations or
installations of multiple technologies at a site. As discussed in
this document, these efficiencies can reduce steel requirement
somewhat and labor needs substantially. Demand for boilermaker
labor is significant when compared to the boilermaker labor supply
basis. However, most boilermakers (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX>) work in the electric
power industry, so it should not be surprising that the percentage
is high. It should also be considered that the value in this table
assumes conservatively high proportion of boilermaker labor and
that the boilermaker trade grows at its minimum target rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX>
percent. In fact, the boilermaker trade has been growing at about
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> due to the improving
employment prospects for boilermakers.
There is also ample SCR catalyst capacity to supply this market.
SCR catalyst manufacturing is almost entirely dedicated to power
generating applications. Thus, it should not be surprising that
demand for initial fill and periodic replacement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> should
account for a significant portion of the supply basis. Moreover,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catalyst</ENAMEX> is currently larger than all of the
other national markets combined. With regard to reagents and other
consumables, clearly there is ample supply of limestone for
additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGD</ENAMEX> systems, especially in light of conservatively high
assumptions that were used to make these estimates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ammonia</ENAMEX> and
urea supply is also plentiful, although it is expected that NOX
reduction will cause a modest increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand. In fact,
there is currently a worldwide excess capacity problem for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> of these commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> that are traded globally.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demand for activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> is expected to increase
by a small amount as a result of a multipollutant strategy,
activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> is traded on a global basis, and there is
currently substantial excess capacity that can readily provide for
this increase in demand. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Suppliers</ENAMEX> have also indicated that new
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> could be brought on line within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years</TIMEX>, if needed, to
satisfy increased demand. Additionally, there are other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> under development that potentially could reduce
activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> demand from what is estimated here.
