Highlights


Why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> Did This Study
Effective performance management systems link individual
performance to organizational goals. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personnel Management</ENAMEX> amended regulations to require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to
link senior executive performance with organizational goals; to
appraise executive performance by balancing organizational results
with customer satisfaction, employee perspective, and other areas;
and to use performance results as a basis for pay, awards, and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> decisions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> were to establish these
performance management systems by their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> senior executive
performance appraisal cycles.
Because they implemented a set of balanced expectations prior to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Personnel Management</ENAMEX> requirement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> studied the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Land Management's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Highway Administration</ENAMEX>'s,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX>'s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Benefits Administration</ENAMEX>'s
use of balanced expectations to manage senior executive performance
in order to identify initial approaches that may be helpful to
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in holding senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> accountable for
results.


What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Found</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reviewed developed an initial set of balanced
expectations for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to address in their individual
performance plans. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> found that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are in the early
stages of using a set of balanced expectations to appraise senior
executive performance and there are significant opportunities to
strengthen their efforts as they move forward in holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>
accountable for results. Specifically, more progress is needed in
explicitly linking executive expectations for performance to
organizational goals. In addition, while these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> address
partnering with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, greater emphasis
should be placed in fostering the collaboration within and across
organizational boundaries to achieve results. Successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organizations</ENAMEX> understand that they must often change their culture
to successfully transform themselves, and such change starts with
top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> performance expectations to lead
and facilitate change could be a critical element as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
transform themselves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> generally agreed with these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conclusions</ENAMEX>, as well as the selected initial implementation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approaches GAO</ENAMEX> identified, as shown below.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Selected Initial Implementation Approaches to Manage Senior</ENAMEX>
Executive Performance that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">May Be Helpful</ENAMEX> to Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies</ENAMEX>
Provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Useful Data</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> disaggregated data from
agencywide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and employee surveys. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land Management and Veterans Benefits Administration</ENAMEX> provide
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> with objective data through real-time data
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can track their individual progress
against organizational goals.
Require Follow-up Action. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> requires
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to develop action plans to follow up on customer
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> issues identified through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">agencywide</TIMEX> surveys. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Highway Administration</ENAMEX> requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to use
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree feedback instruments to solicit employee views on their
leadership skills and then incorporate action items into their
performance plans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next fiscal year</TIMEX>.
Make <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meaningful Distinctions in Performance</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are
working at making distinctions in senior executive performance. To
recognize varying levels of significance and complexity among
executive performance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> established an
executive compensation plan that assigns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to bonus levels
with corresponding bonus ranges based on levels of responsibilities
and commitments.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governmental Affairs United States Senate</ENAMEX>
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have recognized that a critical success
factor in fostering a results-oriented culture is a performance
management system that creates a "line of sight" showing how unit
and individual performance can contribute to overall organizational
goals and helping them understand the connection between their
daily activities and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s success. Effective
performance management systems <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> align <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>'s performance
expectations with organizational goals and then cascade performance
expectations through all levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. Effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> are not merely once-or twice-yearly expectation setting and
appraisal tools, but can help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> manage on a
day-to-day basis. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> use their performance
management systems to achieve results, accelerate change, and
facilitate communication throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> so that discussions
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and organizational performance are integrated and
ongoing. Thus, an effective performance management system can be a
strategic tool for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to drive internal change and
achieve external results.
We have observed that modernizing performance management systems
and linking them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> strategic plans and desired outcomes
should be a top priority as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> seek to transform their
cultures in response to existing and emerging challenges and
opportunities<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> Performance management systems in leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> typically seek to achieve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> key objectives.
First, they strive to provide candid and constructive feedback to
help individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> maximize their contribution and potential
in understanding and realizing the goals and objectives of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, they seek to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> with the objective
and fact-based information it needs to reward top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, performance management systems provide the necessary
information and documentation to deal with poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>. Most
federal performance management systems fail to achieve these
objectives.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> designated strategic human capital
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> as a governmentwide high-risk area<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2 One</NUMEX> of the key
areas challenging federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> is creating results-oriented
organizational cultures. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> lack organizational cultures
that promote high performance and accountability, which are
critical to successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. To help agency leaders
effectively lead and manage their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and integrate human
capital considerations into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> decision making and the program
results they seek to achieve, we developed a strategic human
capital model<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">.3 The</ENAMEX> model highlights the kinds of thinking that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> should apply, as well as some of the steps they can take,
to make progress in managing human capital strategically. As
detailed in that model, one critical success factor is to link unit
and individual performance to organizational goals.
To help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> hold senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> accountable for
organizational results, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Personnel Management</ENAMEX> (OPM)
amended regulations for senior executive performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>. These amended regulations on governing performance
appraisals for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to establish
performance management systems

Results in Brief
that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) hold senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> accountable for their individual
and organizational performance by linking performance management
with the results-oriented goals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and
Results <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1993</ENAMEX> (GPRA), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) evaluate senior executive
performance using measures that balance organizational results with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction, employee perspectives, and any other
measures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> decide are appropriate, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) use performance results as a basis for pay, awards, and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> decisions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> were to establish these
performance management systems by their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> senior executive
performance appraisal cycles.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> objective of this report was to describe the sets of
balanced expectations selected federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> used to appraise
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> performance for organizational results, customer
satisfaction, and employee perspectives. Our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> objective was
to identify the initial implementation approaches these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
have taken to manage senior executive performance that may be
helpful to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> as they implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s amended
regulations governing senior executive performance management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. We selected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Land Management</ENAMEX> (BLM), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Highway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> (FHWA), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Benefits Administration</ENAMEX> (VBA) because they used a set of
balanced expectations to manage the performance of all or a
significant portion of their senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> prior to the OPM
requirement. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> incorporated balanced expectations into its senior
executive performance management system in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX>
Revenue Service Restructuring and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reform Act of 1998</ENAMEX>; the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> established their systems administratively to emphasize
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' accountability for organizational results and
other expectations. As appropriate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> developed the
performance expectations for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> plans to
meet particular program and management objectives and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> needs.
To describe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' expectations for senior executive
performance, we used the categories prescribed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s
regulations-organizational results, customer satisfaction, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> perspective. For additional information on our objectives,
scope, and methodology, see appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> are in the early stages of implementing
new performance management systems for their senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>.
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has taken the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in developing an initial set
of expectations for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to address in their
individual performance plans that are intended to balance
accountability for organizational results with a focus on customer
satisfaction and a consideration of employee

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspectives</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> offered a menu of expectations for
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to choose from and incorporate into their
individual performance plans. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> subsequently used these
expectations as the basis of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' performance
appraisals.

Organizational results. To appraise senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>'
contributions to organizational results, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> identified
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) core competencies and supporting behaviors for senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to follow that are intended to achieve results, such as
learning about current issues and applying that knowledge to make
sound decisions or pursuing business excellence, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to only a
limited extent, targets for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to meet that are
directly linked to organizational goals, such as the average return
on sales of acquired properties or the percent of cases meeting
accuracy standards.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> set expectations for
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to address customer satisfaction in their
individual performance plans and appraised their performance on the
basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> formed, customer feedback, and improved
products and services.



•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee</ENAMEX> perspectives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> set expectations for
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to address employee perspectives in their
individual performance plans and appraised their performance on the
basis of the training provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, safe and healthy work
environment, teamwork, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction, and fairness and
diversity.

In addition, we identified an initial set of selected
implementation approaches <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> are taking that
may be helpful to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> as they manage senior executive
performance against balanced expectations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and
VBA:


•
Provide useful data. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provide senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> with objective data to help them manage their balanced
expectations during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. For example, data systems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VBA</ENAMEX> provide real-time data to help senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> track their
individual performance against organizational results and allow
them to compare their performance against others. In addition, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> disaggregated data from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">agencywide</TIMEX> surveys so that the
results were applicable to the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.


•
Require follow-up action. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> require senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to identify action items to follow up on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> issues. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to hold
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workgroup</ENAMEX> meetings and develop action plans to follow up on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and employee issues identified through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">agencywide</TIMEX> surveys.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> requires senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree
feedback instruments to solicit employee views on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>'
leadership skills and then incorporate action items into their
individual performance plans based on the results.


•
Make meaningful distinctions in performance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
are working at implementing effective performance management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> that make meaningful distinctions in senior executive
performance, such as by identifying varying levels of significance
and complexity among senior executive performance and considering
these levels in awarding bonuses. Towards this end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> established
an executive compensation plan for determining base salary,
performance bonuses, and other awards for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> bonus levels to different levels of responsibilities
and commitments. FHWA weights the elements it uses to appraise
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> performance to make distinctions among its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' performance.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> recognize that they are in the early
stages of implementation in using a balanced set of expectations as
part of their senior executive performance management systems. Not
surprisingly, therefore, there are significant opportunities to
strengthen their efforts as they move forward in holding senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> accountable for results. In particular, more progress is
needed in explicitly linking senior executive expectations for
performance to results-oriented organizational goals. Efforts at
making this direct linkage were often very limited. In addition,
while these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> address partnering with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, greater emphasis should be placed in fostering the
necessary collaboration both within and across organizational
boundaries to achieve results.
Lastly, there is a growing recognition, driven by a variety of
worldwide trends and pressing long-term fiscal challenges, that the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is on the brink of an enormous transformation in
what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> does, how it does business, and, in some cases,
who does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s business. Ultimately, successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organizations</ENAMEX> understand that they must often change their culture
to successfully transform themselves, and that such a change starts
with top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. Senior



Background
executive performance and accountability for change management
will therefore be critical to the success of the federal
government's transformation. A specific performance expectation to
lead and facilitate change could be a critical element as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
transform themselves to succeed in an environment that is more
results oriented, less hierarchical, and more integrated. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue</ENAMEX> provided written comments
generally agreeing with the contents of a draft of this report. In
addition, cognizant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, and VBA
generally agreed with a draft of this report.
Strategic human capital management, and specifically the need to
develop results-oriented organizational cultures, is receiving
increased attention across the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has
underscored the consequences of human capital weaknesses through a
wide range of oversight hearings held over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>. In
addition, to foster a results-oriented culture in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is considering legislative proposals to, among other
things, focus attention on the impact poor performance can have on
the effectiveness of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to have a
chief human capital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> to select, develop, and manage a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">productive</ENAMEX>, high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Management</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agenda</ENAMEX>, released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX>,
identified human capital as one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> key governmentwide
management challenges currently facing the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Subsequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> developed
criteria that recognized the importance of creating a performance
culture that appraises and rewards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> based on their
contributions to organizational goals as a key dimension of
effective human capital management.
We developed a model of strategic human capital management to
highlight the kinds of thinking that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should apply, as well
as some of the steps they can take, to make progress in managing
human capital strategically<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> The model consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> critical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> factors, which are organized to correspond with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cornerstones</ENAMEX> of effective strategic human capital management: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) strategic human capital planning, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) acquiring,
developing, and retaining talent, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) resultsoriented
organizational cultures. Within the cornerstone of
results-oriented
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">373SP</NUMEX>.
organizational cultures, a critical success factor is linking
unit and individual performance to organizational goals.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to reinforce accountability and alignment of individual
performance expectations with organizational goals is through the
use of results-oriented performance agreements. We have reported
that other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have begun to use their performance management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> as a strategic tool to help achieve results.5 In
particular, they use performance agreements to align and cascade
organizational goals to individual performance expectations through
several levels in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. They also use performance
agreements to help identify the crosscutting connections both
within and between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and align the performance commitments
of top-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> with broader governmentwide priorities.
Further, our work has shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have benefited
from their use of results-oriented performance agreements for
political and senior career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>.6 Although each agency
developed and implemented performance agreements that reflected its
specific organizational priorities, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, and cultures, the
performance agreements met the following characteristics. They


•
strengthened alignment of results-oriented goals with
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>,


•
fostered collaboration across organizational
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">boundaries,</ENAMEX>


•
enhanced opportunities to discuss and routinely use
performance information to make program improvements,


•
provided a results-oriented basis for individual
accountability, and


•
maintained continuity of program goals during leadership
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transitions</ENAMEX>.

that used a set of balanced expectations to manage senior
executive performance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> implemented a balanced approach to
manage its senior executive performance to focus attention and
accountability on organizational priorities, make resource
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allocations</ENAMEX>, and minimize employee frustration. BLM incorporated
performance elements in senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' individual performance
plans for the rating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year ending June 2000</TIMEX> that were structured
around its strategic goals to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Restore</ENAMEX> and Maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> implemented a balanced approach to managing its senior
executive performance in response to its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction
survey. Specifically, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> that responded
indicated that they did not understand their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workgroup</ENAMEX>'s role in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implementing FHWA</ENAMEX>'s corporate management strategies that were based
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Baldridge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Quality Award</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Presidential Quality Award Criteria-leadership</ENAMEX>, strategic planning,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> focus, information and analysis, human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> development and management, process <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and
business results<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">.7 Beginning</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> appraised
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> on these corporate management strategies. (For
more information on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>'s senior executive performance plans, see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">app</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>.)
In response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service Restructuring</ENAMEX> and
Reform <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1998</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> initiated a method of measuring performance
designed to foster quality service, promote compliance with the tax
laws, and consider the impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> implemented a senior executive performance management system
that aligned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' performance expectations with a set of
balanced expectations consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction, customer
satisfaction, and business results, and with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional areas
of responsibility-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and equal employment opportunity. (For

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> adopted a balanced scorecard approach in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX> as
a strategic management tool to drive organizational change, provide
feedback to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on measures they can influence, link
performance appraisal and reward systems to performance measures,
and provide incentives to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to work as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> in meeting
performance measures<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> Its scorecard included measures for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accuracy</ENAMEX>, speed and timeliness, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost, customer satisfaction,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> development and satisfaction. VBA incorporated these
measures in the performance appraisals for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in its
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> where the majority of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are
located. (For more information on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s senior executive
performance plans, see app. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX>)
Effective performance management systems
translate organizational priorities and goals into direct and
specific commitments that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> will be expected to
achieve during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. To this end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and VBA
developed a set of expectations for senior executive performance
that were intended to balance organizational results, customer
satisfaction, and employee perspectives and offered a menu of
expectations for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to incorporate into their
individual performance plans. They appraised senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>'
contributions to organizational results by the core competencies
and supporting behaviors senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> followed or the targets
they met. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> appraised senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>'
performance against their expectations for customer satisfaction
and employee perspectives.

accountable for their individual and organizational performance by
linking individual performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> with results-oriented
organizational goals. To appraise senior executive contributions to
organizational results, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> identified core

Core competencies and supporting behaviors: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
identified core competencies and supporting behaviors for senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to follow that are intended to contribute to their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' achievement of performance goals. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> set a
performance expectation for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to develop strategies
to achieve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>'s strategic objectives and performance goals. To
help meet this expectation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Field Services</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX>
convened the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Executive Safety Summit</ENAMEX>" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> to address
the region's highway fatality rates-the highest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>- and
their impact on FHWA achieving its goal on safety. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, including state and federal transportation and safety
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from the region, learned what each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> was doing to
decrease fatality rates and discussed how to create new safety
strategies for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and the region as a whole. Following the
summit, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> held subsequent
state safety summits and pursued numerous initiatives to reduce
fatalities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> reported in his self-assessment
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> that many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> have
experienced a reduction in the number of highway fatalities since
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Executive Safety Summit</ENAMEX>, which is helping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> meet
its goal of reducing the number of highway-related fatalities by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
percent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>.
Similarly, to address <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s performance expectation for senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to develop and execute plans to achieve organizational
goals, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> who is the area <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for compliance
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> has a performance expectation in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>
individual performance plan to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> affected by
the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11, 2001</TIMEX>, are treated and audited according
to their circumstances, and that the compliance guidelines and
policy regarding affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> are adhered to. In particular,
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>-including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>- were not to
be audited for prior tax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years before the end of March 2002</TIMEX>, if
such an audit was necessary.
To contribute to its strategic goal to restore and maintain the
health of the land, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> set an expectation for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to
understand and plan for the condition and use of public lands. In
particular, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> had a performance expectation in her individual performance
plan for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycle to conduct land use
assessments and complete plans as scheduled for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gunnison</ENAMEX> Gorge
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Conservation Area</ENAMEX>. In her self-assessment for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>
performance appraisal cycle, she stated that she began conducting
land use assessments for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunnison Gorge</ENAMEX> and approved "pre-plans,"
which outline the anticipated schedule, budget, and stakeholder
involvement to complete a land use plan.
Targets directly linked to organizational results: VBA
identified targets with specific levels of performance for senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to meet. These targets link to the priorities in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s
balanced scorecard and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Veterans Affairs</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>)
strategic goals. For example, to contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>'s strategic goal
to "provide 'One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>' world class service to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> through the effective management of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, technology,
processes and financial resources" and to address its priority of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accuracy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> set a national target of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72 percent</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> for the accuracy rate of original and reopened compensation
and pension claims and appeals that were completed and determined
to be technically accurate. To contribute to that national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>,
the senior executive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> had a
performance expectation for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to meet a target accuracy
rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59.2 percent</NUMEX>. Similarly, to further contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>'s
strategic goal of world-class service and to address its priority
of speed and



<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Customer Satisfaction</ENAMEX>
timeliness, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> set a national target for property holding
time-the average number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> from date of acquisition to date
of sale of properties acquired due to defaults on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> guaranteed
loans-of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 months</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>. To contribute to the
national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> had a performance
expectation for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to meet a target of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8.6 months</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s regulations recognize that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in public
sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> face the challenging task of balancing the
needs of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, who at times may have differing or
ever competing expectations. Customer involvement is important to
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> make senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> aware of differing or competing
expectations and to then build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> and coalitions to reach
mutual understanding of the issues. To this end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> set expectations for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to address customer
satisfaction in their individual performance plans and appraised
their performance on the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX>, customer feedback,
and improved products and services. Examples of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>'
expectations for customer satisfaction are shown in table 2.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Partnerships: Partnerships</ENAMEX> and coalitions can help senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> work collaboratively with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to ensure that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> takes into account their multiple interests and
achieves results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> have relied on resource
advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">councils</ENAMEX> (RAC) consisting of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> with diverse
interests as a way to involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, identify issues, and reach
a reasonable degree of consensus regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s land management
programs. To meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s expectation to establish cooperative and
constructive relationships that facilitate input from a range of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> set an expectation to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> and maintain close
working relationships with national interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in his
individual plan for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycle. This
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> solicited feedback from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Montana RAC</ENAMEX> to
discuss among his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> how to balance the ongoing, yet
potentially competing uses-including recreation, grazing, and oil
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> leases-of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150-mile</NUMEX> stretch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri River</ENAMEX> and
surrounding areas. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX>, the RAC
recommended that ongoing uses continue, but that this stretch
receive special protection from further development. In his
self-assessment for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycle, the
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> stated that he continues to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAC</ENAMEX> as a
highly effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that plays a significant
role in land management deliberations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Customer feedback: Customer</ENAMEX> feedback can help senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>
determine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>' needs and their levels of satisfaction with
existing products and services. To hold its senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>
accountable for customer satisfaction, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> had performance expectations to meet targets for
veterans giving a high rating on satisfaction surveys.
Specifically, the senior executive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX> regional office
had a target in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> to attain <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> in overall
satisfaction in a national survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> using vocational
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rehabilitation</ENAMEX> and employment services and support.
In addition, to address his performance expectation for customer
satisfaction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waco</ENAMEX> regional
office convened frequent "town hall" meetings to listen to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">veterans</ENAMEX>' needs and discuss VBA issues, such as legislative changes
that affect the processing of veterans' claims. According to this
executive, the town hall meetings helped improve his customer
satisfaction levels because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> identified the concerns that
were most important to them, gained direct access to the VBA
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> working on their benefit claims, and were better able to
understand the claims process. Specifically, the senior executive
reported in his self-assessment that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> he
worked with local service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to identify in advance those
veterans planning to attend the town hall meetings, had their
claims folders available for review at the meetings, and was thus
able to enhance outreach programs.
Improved products and services: Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can use the
feedback from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to enhance the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>' understanding of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and make improvements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
products and services. For example, to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s performance
expectation for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to address customer satisfaction
by continuously improving products and services, a senior executive
responsible for submission processing and taxpayer assistance had a
performance expectation in her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> individual
performance plan to develop a communication plan. This plan was
intended to better serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> by helping improve their
knowledge and understanding of the tax return process.
To hold its senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> accountable for improved products
and services, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> set targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to achieve, such as
the abandoned telephone call rate-the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> who get
through to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>, but are put on hold and hang up before being
connected to an employee. Specifically, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, the
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> had a target for
his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for an abandoned telephone call rate of not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5</NUMEX>
percent for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>' inquiries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s benefit programs, such as
compensation and pension <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee Perspectives OPM</ENAMEX>'s regulations
recognize that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are vital assets and people
achieve organizational goals and results. Accordingly, the
regulations call for senior executive performance plans and
appraisals to contain performance expectations on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspectives</ENAMEX>. To this end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> set expectations
for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to address employee perspectives in their
individual performance plans and appraised their performance on the
basis of the training provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, safe and healthy work
environment, teamwork, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction, and fairness and
diversity. Examples of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' expectations for employee
perspectives are shown in table 3.

Training: Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with the

conducted focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to identify actions needed to respond to the
results of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> survey. One action was to task a
training <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> to develop and implement a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Training Needs</ENAMEX>
Assessment tool to determine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' training needs and to
schedule training for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> stated
in his selfassessment for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> used the assessment tool to establish individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> plans and the training <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> has been scheduling
training sessions to ensure that individual development plans are
met.
To meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s expectation for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to help attract
and retain well-qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> who heads
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> set a performance expectation for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycle to maintain a trained and
motivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> worked with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Resources</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Committee</ENAMEX>, composed of representatives from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BLM</ENAMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> meets regularly to
identify employee issues, make recommendations, and implement
actions. Specifically, with input from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, the senior
executive developed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Mentoring Program</ENAMEX> to enhance and
promote opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' skill development and to
assist them in achieving their career goals. The senior executive
did not discuss the mentoring program in his self-assessment for
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycle, but generally stated that his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> provided training to enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and interpersonal
skills.
Safe and healthy work environment: Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can provide
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with safe, secure, and healthful work conditions to
ensure that the workspace is conducive to effective performance. To
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">address VBA</ENAMEX>'s expectation for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to provide a safe,
healthy work environment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, the senior executive
who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Office</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outpatient</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinic</ENAMEX> worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to improve the security and safety of
the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Specifically, to prepare the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in case
suspicious materials are received, the senior executive reviewed
and updated its emergency evacuation plan and then met with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to ensure they understood the plan's procedures and were
comfortable with their responsibilities. In addition, he worked
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Security Office</ENAMEX> to provide security awareness
training to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and held several emergency drills to test
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' responses. He stated in his self-assessment for fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 2001</TIMEX> that while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were still concerned with security,
he believed confidence in their safety and welfare had
improved.
Teamwork: Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can encourage a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>-based approach
to help improve employee morale and job satisfaction by creating an
environment that is open to communication and has a sense of shared
responsibility for accomplishing organizational goals. To create an
environment in which knowledge is managed, shared, and used
effectively, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> encourages its senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to use
organizational selfassessments to solicit employee perspectives and
gauge their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' work environment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> provides sample
questions for these selfassessments that are based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>
Baldridge criteria. For example, the senior executive heading the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information and Management Services</ENAMEX> required each of her
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> to complete an organizational self-assessment in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> trained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baldridge</ENAMEX> criteria facilitated
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the half-day</TIMEX> sessions for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. As a result of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sessions</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> consolidated the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selfassessments</ENAMEX> and summarized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>'s "strengths" and
"opportunities for improvement" in a report. The report identified
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>'s strengths to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s support and
approval for training, and one of its opportunities for improvement
to be keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> development plans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX>.
In response, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> identified in her individual
performance plan a specific expectation of updating individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> plans for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 30, 2002</TIMEX>.
To meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s performance expectation for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to
motivate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to achieve high performance through open and
honest communication and involve them in decision making, a senior
executive who is the area <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for compliance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
included an expectation in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> individual
performance plan to look for partnering opportunities to maximize
problem resolution and employee involvement, while developing and
maintaining effective relationships with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Employees Union</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> in his area.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction: Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>'
satisfaction with their work environment to gauge if they feel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empowered</ENAMEX> and motivated to contribute to organizational goals. For
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> set a target for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> were to achieve for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>. Based on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-to-5</NUMEX> scale, the target was set by
estimating the average response on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions from the employee
satisfaction survey. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions ask about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s
satisfaction with his or her job and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s overall
satisfaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> set a national
target score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.6</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction in the compensation
and pension services business line in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>. All
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> contribute to the target for this business line.
Specifically, the senior executive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX> regional office
had a performance expectation for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to meet a target score
of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.5</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction.
Fairness and diversity: Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can foster fairness
and diversity by protecting the rights of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, providing
a fair dispute resolution system, and working to prevent
discrimination through equality of




Initial <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Implementation Approaches to</ENAMEX>
Manage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior Executives</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Performance</ENAMEX>
employment and opportunity. To meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s performance
expectation for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to establish a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> tolerance
standard for discrimination, harassment, and hostile work
environments, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> set an expectation in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> plan for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>
performance appraisal cycle that he would demonstrate commitment to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nondiscrimination</ENAMEX> in the workplace by ensuring fair access to
developmental opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
While the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> tailored their performance management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> to fit their organizational and operational needs, we
identified an initial set of implementation approaches that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> are taking that may be helpful to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>

Developed data systems: To help senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> see how they
are contributing to organizational results during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> developed data systems for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to use to track their
individual performance against organizational results. For example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tracking System collects</ENAMEX> and makes available on a
real-time basis data on each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX>'s progress in their
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> towards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s national priorities and the resources
expended on each priority. In particular, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> senior executive in
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> responsible for the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and burro adoptions
program can use the tracking system to identify where the senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> are against their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> and what
the program costs have been by state. Specifically, as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-June</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> had completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">532</NUMEX>
adoptions at a total cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$460,000</NUMEX> towards his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,150</NUMEX>
adoptions for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>. Similarly, the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> had completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> adoptions at a total cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$63,000</NUMEX>
towards his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> adoptions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> also developed a data system that tracks organizational and
individual performance. Its balanced scorecard data are updated
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> can access the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intranet</ENAMEX>. The balanced scorecard compares
actual performance against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> set for the national and
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> levels. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, the scorecard
helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> understand how they can affect the results of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> refer to the balanced scorecard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> at their leadership meetings, discuss how they performed
relative to the scorecard, and identify the causes behind
outstanding and poor performance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disaggregated</ENAMEX> survey data: Specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and employee
feedback helps senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> pinpoint actions to improve
products and services for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and to enhance employee
satisfaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> disaggregated the data from
agencywide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction surveys so that the
results were applicable to a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. For example, from its Use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Authorization Survey</ENAMEX>
administered to its various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX>, BLM
disaggregated the survey data to provide the applicable results to
individual senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> who head the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
Specifically, the senior executive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> state office
received data for his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> showing that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81 percent</NUMEX> of the grazing
permit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> surveyed gave a favorable rating for the
timeliness of permit processing and for service quality. In his
self-assessment for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycle, he stated
that issuing grazing permits has progressed without any problem or
backlogs and that permittees have not experienced any delays.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> disaggregates its survey results to the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and
policy and program support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> that are larger than 15
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in order to allow the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to determine
actions that are appropriate for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, VBA
administered its most recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> survey to measure aspects of
organizational climate related to high performance. For each
question on the survey, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> results and the VBA
average, as well as baseline data from surveys conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> surveyed in the

Require Follow-up Actions
office either strongly agreed or agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> provided
an environment that supports employee involvement, contributions,
and teamwork. According to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> survey results, this percentage
is slightly higher than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43 percent</NUMEX> and indicated
an improvement from the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 percent</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> scored on this
question in both the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997 and 1999</TIMEX> employee surveys. VBA compiles a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> report of the results so that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can
compare how their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> scored against other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> as a
whole.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> disaggregates data to the workgroup level from its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS/National Treasury Employees Union Employee Satisfaction Survey</ENAMEX>,
which measures general satisfaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, the workplace, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup Organization</ENAMEX> administers this survey to all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, which is comprised of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> questions ("Q12");9
additional questions unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, such as views on local union
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chapters</ENAMEX> and employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>; as well as questions on issues
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> has been tracking over time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup</ENAMEX> provides the results for
each workgroup. For example, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> can compare how his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">workgroup</ENAMEX> performed to other operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> as a
whole. Specifically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s workgroup scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.68</NUMEX>
out of a possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> for "having the materials and equipment they
need to do their work right" compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>-wide score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.58</NUMEX>
on the survey. To allow senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to benchmark
externally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup</ENAMEX> compares each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">workgroup</ENAMEX>'s results to the 50th
(median) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75th</TIMEX> (best practices) percentile scores from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q-12</ENAMEX> database. To benchmark internally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> provides the
servicewide results from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>'s survey in each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workgroup</ENAMEX> report.
As part of its senior executive performance management system,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> require their senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to follow up on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and employee issues. To improve customer satisfaction, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue</ENAMEX> set an expectation that the
business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, headed by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, develop action plans
based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> survey data that are relevant to the needs of
their particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> provided guidance to senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to help them understand and interpret the
customer survey data, identify areas for improvement, and develop
action plans to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>' issues and concerns.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> questions that measure employee
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> and, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup</ENAMEX>, the responses to these
questions link directly to organizational outcomes.

For example, to address the customer satisfaction expectation in
his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX> individual performance plan, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> senior
executive who is the area <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for compliance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laguna Niguel</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, requires each of his territory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to present an
action plan identifying ways to improve low scores from customer
surveys. He then rolls up these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>' plans into a consolidated
area action plan for which he is responsible. Specifically, an
expectation in his action plan is to improve how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are
treated during collection and examination activities by ensuring
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> explain to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> rights, as well
as why they were selected for examination and what they could
expect. Further, the senior executive plans to ensure that
territory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> solicit feedback from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> on their
treatment during these activities and identify specific reasons for
any customer dissatisfaction. In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">midyear</TIMEX> self-assessment for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> stated that substantial
progress is being made in achieving the collection and examination
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction goals.
Similarly, to address employee perspectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> requires senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to hold workgroup meetings with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to
discuss the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workgroups</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee Satisfaction Survey</ENAMEX> results and
develop action plans to address these results. According to a
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s criminal investigation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workgroup</ENAMEX> meetings were beneficial because they increased
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and identified improvements in the
quality of worklife. For example, through the workgroup meetings,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> identified the need for recruiting supervisory special
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to even out some of the workload. Subsequently, the senior
executive set an expectation in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX> individual
performance plan to ensure that the field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> has a strong
recruitment program to attract viable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. He also has an
expectation to ensure his field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> hold timely workgroup
meetings and develop and implement action plans to address concerns
identified during these meetings.
To reinforce the importance of follow-up action, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> developed a
Webbased database system to track workgroup issues across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>.
According to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, the system is being upgraded to
improve its usefulness for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and will allow them to
track their progress in completing the actions identified in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workgroup</ENAMEX> meetings. In addition, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> will be able to
access summary information to help identify trends in the data
across workgroups. The system will also provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with the
opportunity to share best practice information on resolved
workgroup issues.


Make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Meaningful Distinctions</ENAMEX> in
Performance
To help meet their employee perspective performance
expectations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> requires senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree
feedback instruments to solicit employee views on their leadership
skills. Based on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree feedback, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are to
identify action items and incorporate them into their individual
performance plans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next fiscal year</TIMEX>. FHWA piloted the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree feedback instrument for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> its leadership <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> and scheduled the rest for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree feedback process is designed to
provide an executive direct input from various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX>- and to compare those results to a
self-evaluation and input from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>.
While the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree feedback instrument is intended for
developmental purposes to help senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> identify areas for
improvement and is not included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s performance
evaluation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are held accountable for taking some action
with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree feedback results and responding to the concern
of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX>. For example, based on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree feedback, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> for field services
identified better communications with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX> and increased
collaboration among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> as areas for improvement, and as
required, he then incorporated action items into his individual
performance plan. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, he set a performance
expectation to develop a leadership self-improvement action plan
and identify appropriate improvement goals. In his self-assessment
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, he reported that he improved his personal
contact and attention to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division offices</ENAMEX> as evidenced by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
percent increase in visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. Also, he
stated that he encouraged his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX> to assess their
leadership skills. Consequently, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX> are using
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree feedback instruments to improve their personal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership competencies</ENAMEX>.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>, the amended regulations were designed to
recognize that effective performance management requires agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> to make meaningful distinctions between acceptable and
outstanding performance of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and to appropriately
reward those who perform at the highest level. Effective
performance management systems provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with the objective
and fact-based information they need to distinguish levels of
performance among senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and serve as a basis for bonus
recommendations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> data on senior executive performance ratings indicate that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> across the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> are not making meaningful
distinctions among senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' performance. Specifically,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> rated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 85 percent and 82 percent</NUMEX> of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>
at the highest level their systems permit in their performance
ratings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 2000 and 2001</TIMEX>, respectively. Nearly all of
the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are rated using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five-</NUMEX>level rating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> with the majority of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> rated under
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-level systems<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> When disaggregating the data by rating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, the percentage of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> that received the
highest level rating under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five-</NUMEX>level systems was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 77</NUMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 2000 and 2001</TIMEX>, respectively. In the
same period, the percent of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> receiving the highest
level rating under three-level systems was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 99 percent</NUMEX>.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> data show that, governmentwide, approximately
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52 percent</NUMEX> of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> received bonuses each year since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between fiscal years 1999 and 2001</TIMEX>, the average
bonus payment increased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $10,200 to $12,300.11</NUMEX> OPM
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us that they plan to closely monitor the
distribution of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX> performance ratings and
bonuses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> recognize that they are still working at
implementing effective performance management systems that make
meaningful distinctions in senior executive performance. For
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> established an executive compensation plan for
determining base salary, performance bonuses, and other awards for
its senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> that is intended to explicitly link
individual performance to organizational performance and is
designed to emphasize performance. To recognize performance across
different levels of responsibilities and commitments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> assigns
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bonus levels at the beginning of
the performance appraisal cycle. Assignments depend on the senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' responsibilities and commitments in their individual
performance plans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, as well as the scope of their work
and its
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> The rating levels for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five-</NUMEX>level systems include
"unsatisfactory," "minimally satisfactory," "fully successful,"
"first level above fully successful," and "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> level above fully
successful"; and the three-level rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> include
"unsatisfactory," "minimally satisfactory," and "fully
successful."
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11</TIMEX> By regulation, bonus amounts paid to individual career senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are limited to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 5 and 20 percent</NUMEX> of the
executive's basic pay. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> bonus totals cannot exceed the
greater of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of the aggregate career senior executive
basic pay or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> of the average rates of career senior
executive basic pay. In compliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue</ENAMEX>
Service Restructuring and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reform Act of 1998</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s bonus totals
cannot exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> of the aggregate career senior executive
basic pay.
impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s overall mission and goals. For example, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue</ENAMEX> or Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> assigns
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to bonus level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-considered to be the level
with the highest responsibilities and commitments-only if they are
a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior Leadership Team</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> restricts the number of
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> assigned to each bonus level for each business
unit.
In addition, for each bonus level, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> establishes set bonus
ranges by individual summary evaluation rating, which is intended
to reinforce the link between performance and rewards. The bonus
levels and corresponding bonus amounts of base salary by summary
rating are shown in table 4.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aBonuses</ENAMEX> paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> career senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are governed by
the limits set forth in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 USC</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5384 and 9505</TIMEX>, which provide that
bonuses shall be not less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> of basic pay.
Source: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> guidance for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>.
To help ensure realistic and consistent performance ratings,
each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> has a "point budget" for assigning
performance ratings that is the total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> points for each
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. After the initial summary evaluation
ratings are assigned, the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' ratings are converted
into points-an "outstanding" rating converts to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> points; an
"exceeded" to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> points, which is the baseline; a "met" to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
points; and a "not met" to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> points. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> unit
exceeds its point budget, it has the opportunity to request
additional points from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Commissioner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>
indicated that none of the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> requested additional
points for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> ratings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> piloted the compensation plan in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX> with the
top senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> that report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX>
Revenue and used it for all senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 percent</NUMEX> of the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> received

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 percent</NUMEX> received a rating of exceeded expectations
compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 percent</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> received a rating of met
expectations compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52 percent</NUMEX>
of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> received a bonus, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 percent</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> indicated that they are still
gaining experience using the new compensation plan and will wait to
establish trend data before they evaluate the link between
performance and bonus decisions.
FHWA weights the elements it uses to appraise senior executive
performance to make meaningful distinctions among its senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) strategic and performance
plan accomplishments and corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> improvements and
results and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) job significance and complexity. The senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> receive a score totaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> points, with a maximum of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> points for strategic and performance plan accomplishments and
corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> improvements and results, and a maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
points for job significance and complexity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> provides
definitions for assigning points. For example, to receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 70</NUMEX>
points for strategic and performance plan accomplishments, the
executive must achieve all the performance expectations identified
in the individual performance plan, including exceptional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advancement</ENAMEX> on the corporate management strategies. To receive all
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> points for job significance and complexity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> must
have a position that is highly visible, with a high degree of
difficulty due to legislation, court decisions, political
pressures, and other factors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> use these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> in
assigning a rating to senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of "achieved results,"
"minimally satisfactory," or "unsatisfactory." In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> received a rating of achieved
results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX> recommended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
percent) receive bonuses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001 and 22</TIMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49 percent</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both years</TIMEX>, each
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> recommended for a bonus received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>, a task force was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX> to review
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s claims processing. It found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> were recommended to receive either a performance bonus or
an increase in senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> rank in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> when performance for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> as a whole was considerably below program goals
and performance varied among regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. Stating that there
must be appropriate rewards for outstanding performance and
negative consequences for those who do not perform according to
their performance agreement, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> recommended that
detailed performance agreements be incorporated into the
performance standards for the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in the regional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
Following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> guidance for bonuses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> receive bonuses by demonstrating significant
individual and organizational achievements during the performance
appraisal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> as evidenced by clearly documented, specific
executive achievements, such as substantive improvements in the
quality of work or significant cost reductions. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> received a bonus,
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> receiving the highest performance
rating of "outstanding."
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> appraises senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' performance and recommends them
for performance awards based on their achievement of the
performance elements in their individual performance plans and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' demonstration of leadership excellence. BLM rates its
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' performance as "pass," "provisional," or "fail."
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> receive a pass rating if they fulfill the fully
successful standards for the performance elements in their
performance plans. All of the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> received a pass
rating in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 and 2001</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycles. For the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 and 2001</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycles, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> of the
Interior guidance limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s total number of senior executive
nominations for performance awards, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX>'s
Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leadership Award</ENAMEX>, performance bonuses, or pay rate
increases, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">no more than 45 percent</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of its career senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> as of the end of the appraisal cycles. Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> rated
career senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> received performance bonuses, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
received pay rate increases, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> received the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX>'s
Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leadership Award in 2000</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> rated
career senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> received performance bonuses and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
received pay rate increases.
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> use their performance
management systems to



Conclusions
achieve results, accelerate change, and facilitate communication
throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> so that discussions about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and
organizational performance are integrated and ongoing. Toward this
end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> are in the early stages of
implementing their new performance management systems for senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>. In particular, while these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> identified core
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">competencies</ENAMEX> and supporting behaviors for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to
follow that are intended to contribute to results, they identified
to a much lesser extent targets for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to meet that
are directly linked to organizational goals. In addition, they
identified expectations for senior executive performance for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction and employee perspectives.
These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have taken the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> steps in creating a
performance management system for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> that is a
strategic tool for holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> accountable for their
contributions to results and organizational success. Their initial
implementation approaches to manage senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' performance
recognize the importance of providing useful data so that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can track their individual performance against
organizational results on a real-time basis and the benefit of
requiring follow-up action on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and employee issues through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workgroup</ENAMEX> meetings and action plans. However, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> also
acknowledge that they are still working at implementing effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> that can make meaningful distinctions in performance.
There are significant opportunities to strengthen these efforts
as they move forward in holding senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> accountable for
results. In particular, more progress is needed in explicitly
linking senior executive expectations for performance to
results-oriented organizational goals, fostering the necessary
collaboration both within and across organizational boundaries to
achieve results, and demonstrating a commitment to lead and
facilitate change. These expectations for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> will be
critical to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> focused on transforming their cultures to
be more results oriented, less hierarchical, and more integrated,
and thereby be better positioned to respond to emerging internal
and external challenges, improve their performance, and assure
their accountability.

Objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
To meet our objectives, we focused our review on federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that have implemented a set of balanced expectations in
their performance management systems for all or a significant
portion of their senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Personnel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> (OPM) amending the regulations. Based on research and
interviews with knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, we identified agencies
that had relevant experience in using a set of balanced
expectations for senior executive performance management systems.
Among the possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with relevant experience, we selected
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Land Management</ENAMEX> (BLM), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Highway Administration</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Benefits</ENAMEX>
Administration (VBA) because they provided variation in mission,
size, and organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
To describe the sets of balanced expectations these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
used to appraise senior executive performance, we collected and
analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' strategic plans, annual performance plans, and
performance reports; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> policies and memoranda; survey
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruments</ENAMEX> and analyses; and the individual performance plans and
self-assessments of the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> we interviewed. We used
the categories in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s regulations to classify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>'
expectations for senior executive performance-organizational
results, customer satisfaction, and employee perspectives. Based on
our review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' expectations, we identified and
categorized the general approaches that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> took to contribute
to organizational results, customer satisfaction, and employee
perspectives, as shown in tables <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and included a sample
of expectations along these approaches. Our analysis and
characterization for categorizing the performance expectations and
examples of those expectations was independently reviewed and
agreed upon for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories.
To identify the initial implementation approaches these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
have taken that may be helpful to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> as they manage
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> performance against the balanced expectations, we
interviewed senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in person or over the telephone at
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHWA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>, we randomly selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
career senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to interview at each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> randomly drawn from central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> randomly drawn from the field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, because
of the larger number of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, we randomly selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>,
or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>, of the career senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to interview,
including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> randomly drawn from central
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> randomly drawn from the
field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The random selections covered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or more</TIMEX> levels of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix I Objectives, Scope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
Schedule for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. This sample is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at their respective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
We identified the examples described in this report through our
interviews with senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. We
did not independently verify the testimonial evidence from the
interviews or the documents that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> provided to us. We also did not attempt to assess the
prevalence of the examples we cite among the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>
within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. Therefore, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> other than
those cited for a particular example may, or may not, be engaged in
the same actions.
In addition, we spoke with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue</ENAMEX>,
the former Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of Benefits for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>, and the former
Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> to discuss their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' experiences and
challenges in implementing balanced expectations in their
performance management systems. We interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> officials
responsible for managing human capital, implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
Performance and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Results Act</ENAMEX> (GPRA), and administering agencywide
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction surveys, as well as other agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> identified as having particular knowledge of balanced
expectations and performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in general. We spoke to OPM
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> responsible for the senior executive performance
management regulations to discuss the development and
implementation of the regulations, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> responsible
for amending and implementing the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> performance
management regulations. Lastly, we met with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executives Association</ENAMEX> and other subject matter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy of Public Administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brookings</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institution</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PricewaterhouseCoopers Endowment for The Business</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>. We performed our work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2001 to July 2002</TIMEX> in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards.

to build consensus; review public comment cards and survey results
to determine where improvements can be made; expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> to
implement on-the-ground activities; implement the service-first
concept and improve overall services; and improve program
accountability and performance by staying within the organizational
cost targets and assuring the accuracy of cost data, conducting the
work aligned with cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, and improving work processes and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> management practices based on analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
evaluation data, such as activity-based cost data.
Improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human resources</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and quality of worklife:
Develop a strategy to provide for a needed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> by developing
and implementing a response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> plan; maintain a
trained and motivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> by implementing plans and
strategies to improve the satisfaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> by assuring
each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> has a current
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix II BLM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior Executive Performance</ENAMEX> Plans
position description and individual performance plan linked to
the strategic plan, and providing appropriate training for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at all levels; demonstrate improvement in diversity and
composition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> as measured by the percent of hiring
opportunities in which diversity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> are placed; demonstrate
commitment to nondiscrimination in the workplace by ensuring that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are not denied employment or career advancement
opportunities due to gender, race, and other factors; and provide
development opportunities to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX> to help them participate
in the goal of achieving workforce diversity.

According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> is planning to revise the
performance elements in its senior executive performance plans for
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> performance appraisal cycle to reflect the priorities of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLM</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of the Interior</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>,
key management objectives, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Management</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agenda</ENAMEX>, and
4Cs philosophy (consultation, cooperation, communication, all in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of conservation). Each performance element will include
a fully successful performance standard. The performance elements
and standards include the following.
• GPRA- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Restore and maintain the health of the land by
conducting assessments and completing land use plan actions as

principal commitment in their individual performance plans focused
on the overall attainment of objectives to accomplish the operating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>'s performance plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retention</ENAMEX> standard: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> developed a performance standard

Summary Ratings


•
Outstanding-The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> met the retention standard and
performed as a model of excellence by exceeding the
responsibilities and commitments in the individual performance
plan, despite constantly changing priorities, insufficient or
unanticipated resource shortages, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">externally</ENAMEX> driven deadlines.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> consistently demonstrated the highest level of
integrity and performance in promoting the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> business plan and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s strategic goals and objectives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s effectiveness
and contributions had impact beyond his or her purview.


•
Exceeded-The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> met the retention standard and
generally exceeded both the responsibilities and commitments in the
individual performance plan. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> may have met
the retention standard and demonstrated exceptional performance in
either responsibilities or commitments and met the expectations of
the other. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> may have overcome significant
organizational challenges, such as coordination with external
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> (e.g., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Treasury Employees Union</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>) or insufficient resources. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s effectiveness
and contributions may have had impact beyond his or her
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purview</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix IV IRS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior Executive Performance</ENAMEX> Plans


•
Met-The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> met the retention standard and the
responsibilities and commitments in the individual performance plan
with solid, dependable performance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> consistently
demonstrated the ability to meet the requirements of the job.
Challenges encountered and resolved are part of the day-to-day
operation and are generally routine in nature.


•
Not met-The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> failed to meet the retention
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX>, responsibilities, and/or commitments. Repeated
observations of performance indicated negative consequences in key
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>, such as quality, timeliness, and business results.
Immediate improvement is essential.

Performance Elements
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> are structured around common performance
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>- service delivery, organizational support/teamwork,
leadership development, external relations, and workplace
responsibilities.
Service delivery: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> leads the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in the
pursuit of outstanding performance in all applicable program areas,
and as a team <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> helps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Delivery Network</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> as
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX> to improve performance. Appropriate emphasis is placed on
the balanced scorecard and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s performance against the
balanced scorecard targets. The categories of the balanced
scorecard include:


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction-organizational perspective from the
viewpoint of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX>, service delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>;


•
accuracy-the quality of work performed;


•
speed or timeliness-the length of time it takes to
complete specific end products or work <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>;


•
unit cost-costs associated with producing a service or a
product; and


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> development and satisfaction-the skill level of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>, training needs, course development, and satisfaction

Organizational support/teamwork: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> regularly
participates in activities and projects intended to further the
goals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Delivery Network</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> as a whole while
functioning as a dedicated and skillful team <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>. These
activities typically require the contribution of local resources
such as projects at the national level, special ad hoc efforts, and
innovations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> is assigned to a certain number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> in light of the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.
Leadership development - executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">competencies</ENAMEX> and
qualifications: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> identifies developmental activities
in a proposed leadership development plan, which is to be submitted
at the beginning of the performance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> engages in
substantial personal development activities such as attending
training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, reading books, and undertaking projects in order

and communications.
External relations: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> builds effective, productive
relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> external to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> in order to
further the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s goals and interests. Examples of
activities include work on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Executive Board</ENAMEX> project,
participation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Integrated Service Network</ENAMEX> meetings, and
relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and service
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.
Workplace responsibilities: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> assures a high quality
of work life for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> by:


•
promoting and maintaining an effective labor-management
relations program that incorporates the principles of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partnership</ENAMEX>;


•
creating and maintaining a working environment that is
free of discrimination and one that assures diversity in the
workplace;


•
ensuring that plans exist and are adequately implemented
to recruit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, retain, motivate, empower, and advance employees
and that they promote the needs and goals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>; and


•
providing a safe, healthy work environment.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> identified indicators of performance for this element
including performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and recognition, employee
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and training, equal employment opportunity policy
statement, physical plant enhancements, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> satisfaction
surveys.
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> receive a level of achievement of
"exceptional," "fully successful," or "less than fully successful"
for each element in their individual performance plan as measured
against the established performance requirements. For example, for
organizational support and teamwork, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s performance is
acceptable if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rater</ENAMEX> determines that completion of projects and
innovations is substantially equal to agreed-upon expectations and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> demonstrates cooperation with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in the
attainment of these goals where applicable. For elements where a
level of achievement other than fully successful has been assigned,
the rating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> must describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s achievements on
additional pages.

measurable performance elements. VBA outlined specific sub-elements
for the service delivery element and replaced the leadership
development element with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional elements-program integrity
and information security. These revisions include the
following.
Service delivery: This element focuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s
performance towards the balanced scorecard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> at the regional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and national levels, in addition to specific performance
priorities with corresponding targets.


•
Achieve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> rating production goals-The executive
will meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> rating production goals in either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> or meet or exceed overall average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> production
goals.


•
Improve the timeliness of rating end products
completed-The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will meet the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of completion
for specific end products and improve a specified percentage based
on his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>'s performance relative to the national
performance. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will improve the cycle times of
claims processing in development, rating, and authorization time as
shown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claims Automated Processing System</ENAMEX> records. In
addition to reducing the cycle time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will establish
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of his or her claims, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1, 2001,within 7</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.


•
Reduce total compensation and pension cases pending over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX>- The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will improve a specified percentage based
on the percentage of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX> cases pending over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX>.
For example, if an executive<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">'s office</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 50 percent</NUMEX> of
compensation and pension cases pending over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX> as of the end
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will achieve a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX>
improvement by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 2002</TIMEX> rating year.


•
Reduce the pending inventory of compensation and pension
claims- The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will reduce the number of rating and
authorization cases pending by set targets for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Meeting
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> will reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s inventory of rating-related cases
to a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">315,586</NUMEX> cases and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V VBA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior Executive Performance</ENAMEX> Plans
reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s authorization cases by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 20 percent</NUMEX> by the
end of the rating period.


•
Reduce inventory of appeals and achieve improvement in
remand timeliness-The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will reduce the total number of
pending appeals by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> and will achieve a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>
improvement in the average number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> a remand is
pending.


•
Achieve established balanced scorecard targets-The
executive's performance on this element will be determined by
comparing the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>'s performance towards the regional
office scorecard targets (weighted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>'s
contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s national scorecard targets (weighted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
percent). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> must achieve a minimum level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX>
of the composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>.


•
Service delivery network resource <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and regional
processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> functions13-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> delivery network
resource center <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are required to meet specific <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>
production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> either in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX> or meet or exceed the
overall average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> production goals. Regional processing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> will have an additional standard provided at
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later date</TIMEX>.


•
Additional priorities as established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Affairs</ENAMEX> will also be used to evaluate performance in this
element.


Program integrity: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will lead his or her regional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to ensure compliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s program integrity
directives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> is responsible for ensuring that program
integrity initiatives and policies are implemented, assessed
through an effective internal control process, and adjusted as
necessary to achieve appropriate results. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> will
accomplish this by adhering to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s program integrity directives
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> recommendations that are applicable and
ensuring that on-site reviews do not reveal critical flaws in
oversight of program integrity issues.
Information security: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> must exercise due diligence
in efforts to plan, develop, coordinate, and implement effective
information security
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">13 VBA</TIMEX> reorganized its regional office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
service delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> areas in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2002</TIMEX>. With the
reorganization, the service delivery network resource <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> are
now called resource <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
