ISSUED BY THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERVICE ENTITLED</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PATHOGEN REDUCTION</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAZARD ANALYSIS AND CRITICAL</ENAMEX>

(i) Cost-benefit analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food Safety and Inspection Service</ENAMEX> (FSIS) prepared a
cost-benefit analysis which concludes that the costs associated
with the rule are far outweighed by the public health benefits to
be derived.
The analysis concludes that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> industry costs are
estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$969 to $1,156 million</NUMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> cost to the
government to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$56.5 million</NUMEX>. The analysis considers data for
average wages, the cost of specific processing equipment and the
cost of conducting specific laboratory analyses.
The potential health benefits resulting from the elimination of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> pathogens is estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7.13 to $26.59 billion</NUMEX> over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>. The range of benefits occurs because of the current
uncertainty in the estimates of the number of cases of foodborne
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and death attributable to the pathogens that enter the meat
and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX> supply at the manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. ยงยง</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSIS</ENAMEX> has concluded that the rule will have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX> and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis and final
regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and included in
the notice of proposed rulemaking and the final rule notice,
respectively, as required by sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603 and 604</NUMEX>. The analyses
comply with the informational requirements of the sections
including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> subject to the requirement
and alternatives considered to reduce to the burden on the small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>.
The final regulatory flexibility analysis discusses the comments
received from both the industry and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Advocacy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Administration</ENAMEX> and the changes made to the proposed rule
to grant regulatory relief to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> including the
sequencing of implementation by establishment size.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-31</NUMEX>
The analyses use both quantifiable and general descriptions of
the effects of the rule on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> as required by section
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607</NUMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, in addition to the actions required by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. ยง</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">553</ENAMEX>, participated in the numerous meetings, forums and
conferences held in connection with the preparation of the final
rule as required by section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">609</NUMEX>.
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. ยงย</ENAMEX>ง <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532-1535</TIMEX>
Based on the cost-benefit analysis performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSIS</ENAMEX>, the rule
will impose an unfunded mandate on the private sector of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$99.6</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$119.8 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> and therefore the rule is subject to the
requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>.
As required by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 205, FSIS</ENAMEX> considered several regulatory
alternatives to the imposition of the mandatory HACCP but
determined that the requirements expressed in the final rule
constituted the most cost-effective and least burdensome
alternative that would meet the objective of the rule.
To fulfill the requirements of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 204</ENAMEX> regarding providing
an opportunity for input from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>, local and tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>,
a "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>-State-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relations Conference</ENAMEX>" was held and the numerous
comments received from these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> were considered and are
discussed in the preamble and the final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Impact</ENAMEX>
Analysis.
Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSIS</ENAMEX> considered the comments of several state
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> that the rule imposed an unfunded mandate on
State inspection programs because of the need for these programs to
remain "at least equal to" the Federal inspection program. FSIS
concluded that because of the necessary restructuring and
reprogramming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> inspection programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSIS</ENAMEX> assistance and
the flexibility provided under the "equal to" provisions, most
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> should be able to complete the modifications to their
programs with minimal additional cost. Moreover, any additional
costs would be eligible to receive <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 50 percent</NUMEX> Federal
matching funds.

public hearing, a scoping session, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> issue-focused public
meetings, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>-State conference, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food Safety Forum</ENAMEX>. In
addition to the information gained through these meetings and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conferences</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,800</NUMEX> comments were received in response to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> notice.
The preamble to the final rule contains an extensive discussion

The rule requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> to document their compliance
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points</ENAMEX> (HACCP)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the development of a plan and thereafter in a
continuous record of process performance. The information
collection requirements were discussed in the preamble to the
proposed rule making published on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 3, 1995</TIMEX>. (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6832</TIMEX>). At the same time, public comments to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSIS</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> were requested.
In the preamble to the final rule, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSIS</ENAMEX> notes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management and Budget</ENAMEX> has approved its information collection
requirements system under OMB No. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0583-0103</TIMEX> with an annual burden
of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14,371,901 hours</TIMEX>. However, in view of comments received and a
reevaluation of the requirements by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> subject matter experts
and private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSIS</ENAMEX> has reduced the annual burden to
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8,053,319 hours</TIMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6,318,582-hour</TIMEX> reduction. This reduction was
obtained through more accurate burden estimates and the elimination
of certain requirements including time and temperature reports and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> resumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">establishment employees</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSIS</ENAMEX> has submitted these changes in the information collection
requirements to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> for its approval and certified to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> that the
information collection complied with each of the objectives
