Preface
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, an understanding has emerged that the federal
government needs to be run in a more businesslike manner than in
the past. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are accountable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shareholders</ENAMEX>, the federal
government is accountable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> are demanding
as never before that the dollars they invest in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> be
managed and spent responsibly.
As countless studies by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> have long noted, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
often fail to appropriately manage their finances, identify clearly
what they intend to accomplish, or get the job done effectively and
with a minimum of waste. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of seeing these problems
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recur</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> moved to address this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endemic</ENAMEX> situation on a governmentwide basis. Major statutes now in
their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of implementation hold substantial promise for
creating a more accountable and effective federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> (CFO) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1990</ENAMEX> provided for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> positions in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and required
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> reports on the financial condition of government entities
and the status of management controls. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX>, federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> will be subject to the same kinds of financial reporting
that have long been required in the private sector and by state and
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology Management</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
requires, among other things, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> set goals, measure
performance, and report on progress in improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> through the use of information
technology.
And, most fundamentally, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and
Results <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1993</ENAMEX> (GPRA), every major federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> must now ask
itself some basic questions: What is our mission? What are our
goals and how will we achieve them? How can we measure our
performance? How will we use that information to make improvements?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> a shift in the focus of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>-away from such
traditional concerns as staffing and activity levels and toward a
single overriding issue: results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to set
goals, measure performance, and report on their
accomplishments.
This will not be an easy transition, nor will it be quick. And
for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> will be difficult to apply. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> has
the potential for adding greatly to government performance-a
particularly vital goal at a time when resources are limited and
public demands are high. To help

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> into effect, we have
identified key steps that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> need to take toward its
implementation, along with a set of practices that can help make
that implementation a success. We learned of these practices from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> that successfully have taken initiatives similar to
the ones required by the act. Several federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that have
already put these practices to use are represented in the case
illustrations that are part of this guide.
This guide is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Guide</ENAMEX>: Improving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission</ENAMEX>
Performance Through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Information Management</ENAMEX> and
Technology, which outlined a number of information management
approaches that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can take to improve their overall
performance. Improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> will
require responsible actions in several areas at once. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> will
demand concerted effort and long-term commitment, but the returns
should be considerable. And <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> deserve no less for
their investment.

Introduction

A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Changing Environment Demands Federal Management Reform</ENAMEX>
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has taken steps to
fundamentally change the way federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> go about their work.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> took these steps in response to management problems so
common among federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that they demanded governmentwide
solutions. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contemporary forces converged to spur
congressional action: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>-in, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>-out budget deficits that had to
be brought down and a public now demanding not only that federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> do their jobs more effectively, but that they do so with
fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and at lower cost.
This was-and remains-an enormous challenge. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, many
of the largest federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> find themselves encumbered with
structures and processes rooted in the past, aimed at the demands
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times, and designed before modern information and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> technology came into being. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are
poorly positioned to meet the demands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1990s.1 Moreover</ENAMEX>, many
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> find themselves without a clear understanding of
who they are or where they are headed. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, as new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> or economic problems emerged, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> assigned many
agencies new and unanticipated program responsibilities. These
additions may have made sense when they were made, but their
cumulative effect has been to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in which many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> cannot say just what business they are in.
In some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' legislative mandates have grown so
muddled that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the executive branch, and other agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> cannot agree on program goals,
worthwhile strategies, or appropriate measures of success. Our work
has shown that the effectiveness of federal program areas as
diverse as employment assistance and training, rural development,
early childhood development, and food safety has been plagued by
fragmented or overlapping efforts<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> A frequently cited example of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlap</ENAMEX> and ineffectiveness is the federal food safety system,
which took shape under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 35</NUMEX> laws and was administered by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> yet had not effectively protected the public
from major foodborne illnesses<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>
Traditionally, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have used the amount of money
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> toward their programs, or the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> deployed, or
even the number of tasks completed as some of the measures of their
performance. But at a

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislative Requirements Support</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managing</ENAMEX> for Results
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> when the value of many federal programs is undergoing
intense public scrutiny, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that reports only these measures
has not answered the defining question of whether these programs
have produced real results. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s environment is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">results-oriented</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the executive branch, and the public
are beginning to hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> accountable less for inputs and
outputs than for outcomes, by which is meant the results of
government programs as measured by the differences they make, for
example, in the economy or program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' lives. A federal
employment training program can report on the number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. That number is an output. Or it can report on the
changes in the real wages of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX>. That number is an
outcome. The difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures is the key to
understanding government performance in a results-oriented
environment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' determination to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> accountable for their
performance lay at the heart of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> landmark reforms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>:
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> (CFO) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1990</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
Performance and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Results Act of 1993</ENAMEX> (GPRA). With these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> laws,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> imposed on federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> a new and more businesslike
framework for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and accountability. In addition, GPRA
created requirements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to generate the information
congressional and executive branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">decisionmakers</ENAMEX> need in
considering measures to improve government performance and reduce
costs.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> was designed to remedy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of serious neglect in
federal financial management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and reporting. It provided
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officers</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> largest federal departments
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, which together account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 98 percent</NUMEX> of the
government's gross budget authority. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> followed up
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Management Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
The latter extended to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 24</NUMEX> CFO Act <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> the requirement,
beginning with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1996</TIMEX>, to prepare and have audited
financial statements for their entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> established the foundation for improving
management and financial accountability among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> is
aimed more directly at improving their program performance. GPRA
requires first that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> consult with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and other
stakeholders to clearly define their missions. It requires that
they establish long-term strategic goals, as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> goals
that are linked to them. They must then measure their performance
against the goals they have set and report publicly on how

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Experiences of Leading Organizations Show a Way</ENAMEX>
well they are doing<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> also are to apply these
principles-goal setting, performance measurement, and reporting-to
their information technology efforts, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information</ENAMEX>
Technology <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Management Reform Act of 1996</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are
to establish performance measures to gauge how well their
information technology supports their program efforts.
At the request of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, we studied a number of leading
public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector organizations</ENAMEX> that were successfully pursuing
management reform initiatives and becoming more results-oriented<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>
We studied state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>; and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. Many of
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> found themselves in an environment similar to
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> confronting federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which they were
called upon to improve performance while simultaneously reducing
costs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> asked whether the experiences of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> could yield worthwhile lessons for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
as they attempt to implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>.
Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied set its agenda for
management reform according to its own environment, needs, and
capabilities. Yet despite their differing approaches to reform, all
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were seeking to become more result-oriented,
and they commonly took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> key steps. These were to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) define
clear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and desired outcomes,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) measure performance to gauge progress, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) use
performanceinformation as a basis for decisionmaking. Although the
organizations we studied were not acting under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GPRA</ENAMEX>, their three
key steps were consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>'s requirements. That is, the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step-define mission and desired outcomes-corresponds to the
requirement in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to develop strategic plans
containing mission statements and outcome-related strategic goals;
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step-measure performance-corresponds to the GPRA
requirement for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to develop annual performance
plans with annual performance goals and indicators to measure
performance; and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> step-use performance

information-although much broader, includes the requirement in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to prepare annual performance reports
with information on the extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has met its
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> performance goals.
Along with each step, certain practices proved especially
important to the success of their efforts. In addition to these
steps, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also found that certain top leadership
practices were central to making the changes needed for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> to become more results-oriented.
Taken together, the key steps and practices drawn from the
organizations we studied provide a useful framework for federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> working to implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>. The key steps and practices are
shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.

In this executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>, we discuss the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> key steps and
their relationship to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, along with the practices associated
with each step<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> In the final section of this executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>, we
discuss the role of top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and the practices it can follow
if it hopes to make GPRA a driving force in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
Accompanying the discussion of each practice is a case illustration
involving a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that has made progress in incorporating
the practice into its operations. The fact that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is
profiled for a particular practice is not meant to imply success or
lack of success in other dimensions. Moreover, underscoring the
fact that implementing management changes required by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> will not
come quickly, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> profiled began their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">results-oriented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> was enacted.
The experiences of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> suggest that the
successful implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> may be as difficult as it is
important. For example, obtaining agreement among often competing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> is never easy, particularly in an environment where
available resources are declining. In addition, measuring the
federal contribution to outcomes that require the coordinated
effort of numerous public and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>-such as improvements
in education, employment, or health-can require sophisticated and
costly program evaluations.
To help ensure the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX>, which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> created to provide the leadership foundation necessary to
effectively carry out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX>'
responsibilities, established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA Implementation Committee</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> is providing guidance and information to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> covered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> recognized that uncertainty or fear of failure may
immobilize an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s efforts to implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> and that its
implementation is evolutionary in that proficiency comes with time
and experience. To assist federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> published
guiding principles and key issues for implementing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GPRA.7</NUMEX> Our guide
is intended to complement the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>'s work in assisting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> as they implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>. Our work has shown that although
the steps and practices discussed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> don't come quickly
or easily, they can serve as the fundamental building blocks to
creating a results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to submit major parts of their strategic plans by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 7</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>.
Strategic plans are intended to be the starting point for each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s performance measurement efforts. Each plan must include a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> mission statement based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s statutory
requirements, a set of outcome-related strategic goals, and a
description of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> intends to achieve these goals. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> statement brings the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> into focus. It explains why the
agency exists, tells what it does, and describes how it does it.
The strategic goals that follow are an outgrowth of this clearly
stated mission. The strategic goals explain the purposes of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s programs and the results they are intended to achieve.
In crafting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recognized that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> do
not exist in a vacuum. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> develop their mission statements
and establish their strategic goals, they are required by the act
to consult with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and their other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>.
Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> must be alert to the environment in which they
operate; in their strategic plans, they are required to identify
the external factors that could affect their ability to accomplish
what they set out to do.
We found that leading results-oriented organizations
consistently strive to ensure that their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> activities
support their organizational missions and move them closer to
accomplishing their strategic goals. In practice, these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> see the production of a strategic plan-that is, a
particular document issued on a particular day-as one of the least
important parts of the planning process. This is because they
believe strategic planning is not a static or occasional event. It
is, instead, a dynamic and inclusive process. If done well,
strategic planning is continuous and provides the basis for
everything the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> does <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>.
For strategic planning to have this sort of impact, three
practices appear to be critical. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX> must (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) involve
their stakeholders; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) assess their internal and external
environments; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) align their activities, core processes, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to support mission-related outcomes.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Practice 1: Involve Stakeholders</ENAMEX>
Successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied based their strategic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX>, to a large extent, on the interests and expectations of
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognize that stakeholders
will have a lot to say in determining whether their programs
succeed or fail. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">third-party</ENAMEX> service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>,
and, of course, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>.
In the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, stakeholder involvement is
particularly important as federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> face a complex political
environment in which legislative mandates are often ambiguous.
Thus, the basic questions that must be answered in crafting a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> statement-what is our purpose, what products and services
must we deliver to meet that purpose, and how will that be
done-will present a significant challenge for many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. While
statutory requirements are to be the starting point for agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> statements, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the executive branch, and other
interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> may all disagree strongly about a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> and goals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> seeks to address such situations by
requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to consult with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and other stakeholders
to clarify their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and reach agreement on their goals. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX>
agreement among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> on all aspects of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s efforts
is relatively uncommon because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> can differ
often and significantly.
Still, stakeholder involvement is important to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
ensure that their efforts and resources are targeted at the highest
priorities. Just as important, involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in strategic
planning efforts can help create a basic understanding among the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> of the competing demands that confront most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>,
the limited resources available to them, and how those demands and
resources require careful and continuous balancing. Because of its
power to create and fund programs, the involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is
indispensable to defining each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s mission and establishing
its goals<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> This may entail identifying legislative changes that
are needed to clarify or modify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' intent and expectations
or to address differing conditions and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>' needs that have
occurred since the initial statutory requirements were established.
Congressional consultations also may include additional guidance on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' priorities in those frequent cases where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> statutory mission.

Case Illustration: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>
Involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> is important as well. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>
are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that are served by its
programs. This is not to say that contact between a federal agency
and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> is always direct. Many federally mandated or
federally funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> are dispensed through <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, such
as state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, or medical insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. In such
cases, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> face the particularly challenging task of
balancing the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, who at times may have differing or even competing
goals.
In our reviews of successful results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, we
found numerous examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that achieved positive
results by involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in defining
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and desired outcomes<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, for one, developed
consensus on its statewide strategic plan by bringing together such
diverse stakeholders as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>, state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, county
and local government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and community group
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Office</ENAMEX>, for another, used
surveys to obtain its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>' views on the degree to which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> was contributing to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>' export activities. On
the basis of the data it obtained, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade Office</ENAMEX> made program
changes and improved both its performance and its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responsiveness</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>) was established in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> under a presidential reorganization plan in response to public
concerns over unhealthy air, polluted rivers, unsafe drinking
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and haphazard waste disposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
responsibility for implementing federal environmental laws. From
the start, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> lacked an overarching legislative mission,
and its environmental responsibilities have yet to be integrated
with one another. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> could not ensure that it was
directing its efforts toward the environmental problems that were
of greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> or posed the greatest risk to the
health of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or the environment itself. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
decided in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> to launch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Environmental Goals Project</ENAMEX>,
a long-range planning initiative under which it would involve its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in developing measurable goals for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> to pursue in
improving the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s environment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> designed its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Environmental Goals Project</ENAMEX> to produce
a set of long-range environmental goals, including milestones to be
achieved by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> recognized that while environmental
goals should be

Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assess the Environment</ENAMEX>
grounded in science and factual analysis, they should be based,
as well, on the needs and expectations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> initiated a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> public meetings to hear their
views. The meetings were held around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and included
environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, state and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>. To provide
a basis for discussion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> drafted and distributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
a set of goal statements and descriptive information on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
broad environmental goal areas that its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> considered to be of
the greatest national importance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> used the information it received at these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> meetings to
revise and better define these goals. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> added
milestones for managing and cleaning up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">radioactive waste</ENAMEX>,
restoring contaminated sites to productive use, and slowing habitat
losses. Further, it added the goal of improving its dissemination
of environmental information and its other education efforts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
found that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> included how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> does its
core processes-for example, the amount of flexibility it can offer
to the regulated community. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> recognized these stakeholder
interests in a summary report of its revised goals that it sent to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and its other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1995</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> continued to involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in the National
Environmental Goals Project by soliciting comments on the summary
report. Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> are businesses or other
regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to address such matters
as the procedural costs of environmental regulations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> responded
with a discussion of the overall costs and benefits of controlling
pollution. At its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>' request, it provided trend data and
laid out strategies for achieving its environmental milestones. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
recognizes that involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> is an ongoing effort that
needs to be continued. The proposed goals are to be sent again to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX>, state, local, and tribal government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> for
another round of review <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</TIMEX>, and plans are being made
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> review.
Good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have understood for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> that many
forces-both inside and outside their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>-can influence
their ability to achieve their goals. But even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who try to
stay alert to these forces often gather their information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anecdotally</ENAMEX> or informally. In contrast, the successful
organizations we studied monitor their internal and external
environments continuously and systematically. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX> that do
this have shown an ability to anticipate future challenges and to
make

adjustments so that potential problems do not become crises<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>
By building environmental assessment into the strategic planning
process, they are able to stay focused on their long-term goals
even as they make changes in the way they intend to achieve
them.
Both the external and internal environments are important, and
neither can be viewed independently of the other. Assessing the
external environment is particularly important, in part because so
many external forces that fall beyond an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s influence
can powerfully affect its chances for success. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private, external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> can include newly emerging
economic, social, and technological trends and new statutory,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regulatory</ENAMEX>, and judicial requirements. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> include its culture, its management practices, and its
business processes. Today, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> find that monitoring
these internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> is especially important, given the effects of
funding reductions and reorganizations. The tools available to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> assessing the internal environment include program
evaluations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> surveys, independent audits, and reviews of
business processes.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>-the oldest federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>-are to ensure that goods and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> entering and exiting
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> comply with all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> laws and regulations, while
also facilitating the legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> of goods and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>. But long-standing management problems,
including weaknesses in strategic planning, had threatened the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s ability to adapt to changing demands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>' strategic
planning efforts now focus on the dramatic changes occurring in its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">external</ENAMEX> and internal environments and on the equally dramatic
changes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will need to make in response.
Recognizing that the international trade environment has
undergone many changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>
identified the new challenges these changes brought it in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>
strategic plan. The clearest challenge for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> would be to
manage a workload that was growing rapidly and that could not be
expected to taper off. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1986 to 1995</TIMEX>, for example,
total import entries increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">242 percent</NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11.1 million</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38.0 million</NUMEX>. During the same period, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> arrivals increased
by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42 percent</NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">304 million to 431 million</NUMEX>. Customs anticipated
that world trade would also continue to accelerate. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
alone, approximately

<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$761 billion</NUMEX> in merchandise was imported into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the decade</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> expects that figure to grow by
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>.
Customs anticipated that trade issues would assume greater
prominence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming years</TIMEX> as developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> continue to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">industrialize</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> continue to expand internationally, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> barriers continue to fall. Further, the proliferation of
international trade agreements, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.-Canada Free Trade</ENAMEX>
Agreement of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American Free Trade Agreement</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX>, should lead to further
increases in trade and travel volume.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Internally</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> anticipated that as public pressures to
reduce the federal deficit continued, no real growth would occur in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s funding. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> also anticipated attrition among its
staff and a loss of valuable expertise due to that attrition. It
determined that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>,
would be eligible to retire.
All of these forces-external and internal-have caused the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> to begin to reengineer its core processes,
including those related to the movement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and cargo into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and the movement of cargo out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is undertaking a major
reorganization structured from the ground up, using its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">301</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>
as its foundation. While headquarters staffing is to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streamlined</ENAMEX>, the staffing levels at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> are to be maintained
or increased. Under the reorganization, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">port</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> are to be
given some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> previously exercised at the district or
regional levels.
It is too soon to tell how effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>' reorganization
will be in responding to the pressures it faces. But by assessing
its external and internal environments, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> came to see that
its traditional ways of pursuing its mission were no longer viable
and that major changes would be needed.
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognize that sound planning is not
enough to ensure their success. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s activities, core
processes, and resources must be aligned to support its mission and
help it achieve its goals. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> start by assessing
the extent to which their programs and activities contribute to
meeting their mission and desired outcomes. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
became more results-oriented, they often
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/GGD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-118</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and Results
Act
found it necessary to fundamentally alter activities and
programs so that they more effectively and efficiently produced the
services to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>' needs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>' interests. For
example, we have traced the management problems of many federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that are obsolete and
inadequate to modern demands<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> As federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> become more
outcome-oriented, they will find that outmoded organizational
structures must be changed to better meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> needs and
address the interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> align their activities to support mission-related
goals, they should also make better linkages between levels of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funding</ENAMEX> and their anticipated results. Under a series of
initiatives called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connecting Resources</ENAMEX> to Results, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> is seeking
to adopt a greater focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' goals and performance in
making funding decisions. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1996</TIMEX> budget
preparation guidance said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> were to identify key features of
their streamlining plans (e.g., increased span of control, reduced
organizational layers, and/or milestones for full-time equivalents)
and encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to include performance goals and indicators
in their budget justifications<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX> Whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> documents discussed streamlining primarily in terms of the
number of positions to be eliminated, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year 1996</TIMEX> budget
documents included discussions about how proposed staff reductions
could affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' performance. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s guidance,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1997</TIMEX> budget requests were to contain a
significantly greater amount of performance information to help
define funding levels and projected program results. For the fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1998</TIMEX> budget, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> plans to continue to increase the role of
performance goals and information in guiding funding decisions.
We also have found that leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> strive to ensure
that their core processes efficiently and effectively support
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>-related outcomes. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> rely increasingly on
a well-defined mission to form the foundation for the key business
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and processes they use to ensure the successful outcome of
their operations. For example, many successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> approaches, coupled with new information
technology, can make success more or less likely-depending on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> they are handled. We found that successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> pursue
something called strategic information management-that is,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of information and information technology
to maximize improvements in mission performance. Strategic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will be an important part of any federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s attempt to implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> successfully. Managing better
requires that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have, and rely upon, sound financial and
program information. Strategic information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> would lead to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> that would better provide federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> the data they
need in considering ways to realign their processes, reduce costs,
improve program effectiveness, and ensure consistent results with a
less bureaucratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. Lacking these data, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
would be missing one of the indispensable ingredients of successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.
Established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>) is responsible for the coordination of civil emergency
planning and mitigation as well as the coordination of federal
disaster relief. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> is responsible for responding to floods,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hurricanes</ENAMEX>, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loma Prieta</ENAMEX> earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> generated intense
criticism of the federal response effort. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Andrew</ENAMEX>, which
leveled much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Florida</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, raised further doubts as to
whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> was capable of responding to disasters. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> refocused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> on meeting its mission and
aligning its activities to better serve the public.
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> issued its mission statement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1993</TIMEX>, it has
been reexamining its approach to limiting deaths and property
losses from disasters. Traditionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> had concentrated its
efforts on post-disaster assistance. But after taking a hard look
at its performance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> concluded that it could better fulfill its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> by addressing the range of activities available before,
during, and after disaster strikes.
14GAO<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/AIMD-94-115</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1994</TIMEX>.
As part of its first agencywide strategic planning effort, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>
comprehensively reviewed its programs and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and initiated
a major reorganization in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1993</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> concluded that all
emergencies share certain common traits, pose some common demands,
and ought to be approached functionally. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>'s new, "all-hazard"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> takes a multifaceted, sequential approach to managing
disasters: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> now focuses its disaster planning and response processes on
steps that need to be taken, not just during and after the event,
but in advance. To build preparedness, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> now seeks to build
partnerships with other federal, state, and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is working with local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and the
building industry to strengthen building codes so that structures
will be better able to withstand disasters. It has also launched an
effort to increase the number of flood insurance
policyholders-something that had not been a traditional focus of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> but that is now understood as being critical to helping
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> recover from disasters. By more closely aligning its
activities, processes, and resources with its mission, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> appears
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to be better positioned to accomplish that mission.

The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> key step that successful results-oriented
organizations we studied take-after defining their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and
desired outcomes-is to measure their performance. Measuring
performance allows these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to track the progress they
are making toward their goals and gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> crucial
information on which to base their organizational and management
decisions. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognize, as well, that
performance measures can create powerful incentives to influence
organizational and individual behavior.
GPRA incorporates performance measurement as one of its most
important features. Under the act, executive branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are
required to develop annual performance plans that use performance
measurement to reinforce the connection between the long-term
strategic goals outlined in their strategic plans and the
day-to-day activities of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. The annual
performance plans are to include performance goals for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
program activities as listed in the budget, a summary of the
necessary resources to conduct these activities, the performance
indicators that will be used to measure performance, and a
discussion of how the performance information will be verified. For
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> requires that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> program
performance planning efforts be linked directly to their budget
estimates and obligations. This linkage is achieved by requiring
performance goals and measures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' program activities
that are included in their budget requests. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recognized
that the activity structure in the budget of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
government is not consistent across various programs. As a result,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to consolidate, aggregate, or
disaggregate the lists of program activities appearing in the
budget accounts.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these annual performance plans is to cover fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1999</TIMEX>; each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is to submit its plan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> in the fall of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> is requiring descriptions of the proposed
performance goals and indicators for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX> with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1998</TIMEX> budget request.
In developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recognized that federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>-unaccustomed as they are to the practice-may find that
developing performance measures is a difficult and time-consuming
task. As a result, it provided for selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and programs
to pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>'s goal-setting and performance measurement
requirements before these are applied governmentwide. Our work with
leading results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> confirmed that many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
may need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to develop a sound set of performance measures.

Vital Few, Respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Priorities</ENAMEX>, and Link to Responsible
Programs
We learned, as well, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that were successful in
measuring their performance generally had applied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> practices.
First, they developed performance measures based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
characteristics. These measures were (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) tied to program goals and
demonstrated the degree to which the desired results were achieved,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) limited to a vital few that were considered essential for
producing data for decisionmaking, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) responsive to multiple
priorities, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) responsibility-linked to establish
accountability for results. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, recognizing that they must
balance their ideal performance measurement systems against
real-world considerations, such as the cost and effort involved in
gathering and analyzing data, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied made
sure that the data they did collect were sufficiently complete,
accurate, and consistent to be useful in decisionmaking.
As the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied strive to align their
activities and resources to achieve mission-related goals, they
also seek to establish clear hierarchies of performance goals and
measures. Under these hierarchies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> try to link
the goals and performance measures for each organizational level to
successive levels and ultimately to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s strategic
goals. They have recognized that without clear, hierarchically
linked performance measures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> throughout the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> will lack straightforward roadmaps showing how their
daily activities can contribute to attaining organizationwide
strategic goals and mission. Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that are developing
such hierarchies for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are finding that
organizationwide performance measurement efforts take time and
require the active involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at all organizational
levels.
The experiences of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, foreign, and federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> show that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> characteristics are common to
successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hierarchies</ENAMEX> of performance measures<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> These
characteristics include the following:
Demonstrate results: Performance measures should tell each
organizational level how well it is achieving its goals. Yet,
simple as this principle may appear, it poses an especially
difficult challenge for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, for whom the link between
federal efforts and desired outcomes is often difficult to
establish and may not, in fact, be apparent for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Research
programs provide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> example. So do many health and

welfare programs that are delivered jointly with state and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">third-party service</ENAMEX> deliverers.
Limited to the vital few: The number of measures for each goal
at a given organizational level should be limited to the vital few.
Those vital few measures should cover the key performance
dimensions that will enable an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to assess
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accomplishments</ENAMEX>, make decisions, realign processes, and assign
accountability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX> that seek to manage an excessive
number of performance measures may risk creating a confusing excess
of data that will obscure rather than clarify performance issues.
Limiting the number of performance measures to the vital few at
each organizational level will not only keep the focus where it
belongs, it will help ensure that the costs involved in collecting
and analyzing the data do not become prohibitive. As a result,
lower organizational levels may use different measures and goals
from those meaningfully or appropriately included in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s annual performance plan. Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> will
have more goals and measures than can be meaningfully or
appropriately included in the governmentwide performance plan OMB
will develop under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GPRA</ENAMEX>. However, as performance plans are compiled
for higher organizational levels, the consolidation and possible
exclusion of some goals and measures does not mean that those goals
and measures are not important to guide the efforts of the lower
levels and should still be monitored.
Respond to multiple priorities: Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> often face a
variety of interests whose competing demands continually force
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">policymakers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to balance quality, cost, customer
satisfaction, stakeholder concerns, and other factors. Performance
measurement systems must take these competing interests into
account and create incentives for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to strike the difficult
balance among competing demands. Performance measurement efforts
that overemphasize one or two priorities at the expense of the
others may skew the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s performance and keep its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> from
seeing the whole picture.
Link to responsible programs: Performance measures should be
linked directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> that have responsibility for making
programs work. A clear connection between performance measures and
program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> helps to both reinforce accountability and ensure
that, in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> activities, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> keep in mind the
outcomes their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is striving to achieve. This connection
at the program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> helps to lay the groundwork for
accountability as measures advance through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. By helping
to lay the groundwork for accountability, a connection between

Administration
performance measures and program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> also provides a basis
for determining the appropriate degree of operational authority for
various organizational levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> must have the authority and
flexibility for achieving the results for which they are to be held
accountable.
The mission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Oceanic and Atmospheric</ENAMEX>
Administration (NOAA) is to describe and predict changes in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX>'s environment, as well as to conserve and manage the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> and marine resources to ensure sustainable economic
opportunities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> concluded in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> strategic plan that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s ability to prepare for severe weather events, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tornadoes</ENAMEX>, thunderstorms, hurricanes, and flash flooding, depends
on the quality and timeliness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s observations,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assessments</ENAMEX>, and information delivery. Through strategic planning,
NOAA evaluated how best to accomplish its mission and then put into
place those performance measures essential to demonstrating the
extent to which it was attaining its desired outcomes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> determined that the most important business of its
short-term warning and forecast weather services was to predict the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and location of weather events and to do so with accuracy.
Rather than simply count the number of forecasts it made-that is,
to simply gather data on its activity level-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> began to measure
the extent to which it could increase the lead time or advance
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> it gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> prior to severe weather events. It
decided, in other words, to measure what counts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> reported that from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 1995</TIMEX>,
its lead time for predicting tornadoes increased from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 minutes</TIMEX> to
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 minutes</TIMEX>, and the accuracy of its predictions increased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
percent of the time to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of the time. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> has set targets of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64 percent</NUMEX>,
respectively.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> also measured how accurately it could predict the range
where hurricanes would reach land, given a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> lead time. From
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 1995</TIMEX>, its accuracy improved from
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">185 kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">115 miles</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">134 kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">83 miles</NUMEX>). It
credited the improvement to its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1995</TIMEX> of a new
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">hurricane</ENAMEX> tracking model. On the basis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1995</TIMEX>
performance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> revised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its fiscal year 1996</TIMEX> target from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">155</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kilometers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">96 miles</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">93 miles</NUMEX>). Although the
new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1996</TIMEX> target of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 kilometers</NUMEX> is higher than the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1995</TIMEX> actual performance of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">134 kilometers</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> wants

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consistent Data</ENAMEX>
model through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least another hurricane season</TIMEX> before radically
revising its targets for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">future years</TIMEX>.
The significance of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and more accurate hurricane warnings
is enormous. Most importantly, they help prevent deaths and
injuries. But they also save money, because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and more
accurate predictions of hurricane tracks and intensities can reduce
the size of the warning areas in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are advised to
prepare for the event. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> calculated that for each hurricane, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">public</ENAMEX>'s preparation and evacuation costs exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50 million</NUMEX>, but
improved predictions can cut that cost by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 million</NUMEX>. In addition,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> believe that the public takes more accurate
forecasts more seriously-which helps lessen loss of life and
property.
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we examined developed their performance
measures, they paid special attention to issues relating to data
collection. Although they recognized that adequate and reliable
performance data are indispensable to decisionmaking, they were
also aware that collecting the data can be costly and difficult. As
a result, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, they will have to balance the
cost of data collection efforts against the need to ensure that the
collected data are complete, accurate, and consistent enough to
document performance and support decisionmaking at various
organizational levels.
As the experiences of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> demonstrated, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
striving to reach organizational goals must have information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> in place to provide them with needed information<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX> In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said that the state restructured its
statewide information systems to include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and goals of
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, specific strategies for achieving objectives, and
measures of progress. The system also linked budgeted expenditures,
accounting information, and performance data.
Our work has shown consistently that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
basic financial and information management systems are woefully out
of date and incapable of meeting modern needs for fast, reliable,
and accurate information-particularly as these needs relate to
financial reporting and program costs. As the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
we studied became more results-oriented, many of them made
significant investments in their information management systems.
Many federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> will need to do the same. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can
keep costs down by applying the performance measurement principles
these leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have employed and

also-where they can-by building performance data collection into
the processes that govern <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, rather than creating
entirely new and separate data collection systems.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> is to reduce casualties and economic losses resulting from
motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> crashes. To accomplish its mission, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> pursues two
main strategies: setting and enforcing safety performance standards
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor vehicles</ENAMEX> and promoting safe driving behavior. After it
was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> concluded that reliable crash
statistics databases were needed. The need was twofold: to help in
identifying and analyzing traffic safety problems and for
evaluating the effectiveness of motor vehicle safety standards and
highway safety initiatives. To fill this need, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> developed data
collection systems derived from existing data sources and has taken
steps to ensure the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of
these data.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> has developed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> data systems that, taken together, serve
as a single source of motor vehicle crash statistics. The Fatal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accident Reporting System</ENAMEX> has enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> to document that the
rate for one of its desired outcomes-reduction in the fatality
rate-decreased from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated 1.7</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 million</NUMEX> vehicle
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX> of travel from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1995.17</NUMEX> Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> has used data from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Estimates System</ENAMEX> to document another one of its desired
outcomes-a reduction in injury rates-from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">169 to an estimated 138</NUMEX>
injuries per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 million vehicle miles</NUMEX> of travel from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> to

then interpret and code the data directly from the reports into a
central electronic data file. The data are checked for consistency
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both coding</TIMEX> and subsequent processing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> has recognized that its data have limitations. For
example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Estimates System</ENAMEX> is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> reports,
but various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of the motor vehicle
crashes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are not reported to police, and the majority
of these unreported crashes involve only minor property damage and
no significant injury. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> study of the costs of motor vehicle
injuries estimated the total count of nonfatal injuries at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 5</NUMEX>
million compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Estimates System</ENAMEX> estimate for that
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2 million</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX> intends to study the unreported injury
problem.

The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> key step in building successful results-oriented
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">organizations-</ENAMEX> after establishing an organizational mission and
goals and building a performance measurement system-is to put
performance data to work. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> should use performance
information to continuously improve organizational processes,
identify performance gaps, and set improvement goals<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX>
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> are fully implemented, decisionmakers
are to routinely receive the performance and cost information they
need to assess their programs and make informed decisions.
Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decisionmaking</ENAMEX> should also benefit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> was
intended, in part, to improve congressional decisionmaking by
giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> comprehensive and reliable information on the
extent to which federal programs are fulfilling their statutory
intent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">act</ENAMEX> requires that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on its performance-specifically, on the
extent to which it is meeting its annual performance goals and the
actions needed to achieve or modify those goals that have not been
met. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> performance reports are intended to provide important
information to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, policymakers, and the public on
what each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> accomplished with the resources it was given. The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these reports, covering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>, is due by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 2000</TIMEX>.
In crafting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recognized that different information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> would have differing information needs. Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> must
determine what information is both relevant and essential to
different internal and external information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and include only
the information the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> require<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX> Most important, agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> need performance information to ensure that programs meet
intended goals, assess the efficiency of processes, and promote
continuous improvement. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> needs information on whether and
in what respects a program is working well or poorly to support its
oversight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and their budgets<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies</ENAMEX>' stakeholders
need performance information to accurately <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> program
effectiveness.
In short, we have found that leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that
progressed the farthest to results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> did not stop
after strategic planning and performance measurement. They applied
their acquired knowledge and data to identify gaps in their

performance, and finally use that information to improve their
performance to better support their missions.
Performance data can have real value only if they are used to
identify the gap between an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s actual performance level
and the performance level it has identified as its goal. Once the
performance gaps are identified for different program areas,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> can determine where to target their resources to improve
overall mission accomplishment. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are forced to reduce
their resources, the same analysis can help them target reductions
to keep to a minimum the threat to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s overall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>.
The leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied recognized that improvement
goals should flow from a fact-based performance analysis and be
rooted in organizational missions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX> Such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> typically
assess which of their processes are in greatest need of improvement
in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness. By analyzing the gap
between where they are and where they need to be to achieve desired
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> can target those processes that are in most
need of improvement, set realistic improvement goals, and select an
appropriate process improvement technique<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22 One</NUMEX> technique these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> used is benchmarking-comparing their processes with
those of private and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that are thought to be
the best in their fields. By benchmarking its own processes against
those of the best in the business, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> can learn how
much change it needs to make and what changes might be the right
ones.


Case Illustration: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Health Administration</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Health Administration</ENAMEX> (VHA) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Affairs</ENAMEX> runs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s largest medical care

recognizes that its ability to survive growing market pressures,
answer criticisms of health care quality, and sustain and improve

to identify performance gaps. With better data in hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> is
taking actions to improve its products and services.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> has provided medical care to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 60 years</TIMEX>.
Traditionally, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has lacked the sort of data
needed to assess the quality, cost, and effectiveness of its care.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX>'s current data analysis efforts are structured to provide
caregivers with improved data on medical outcomes. It has begun to
use this performance information to improve service to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">veterans</ENAMEX>.
An example is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX>'s effort to benchmark the success of cardiac
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeries</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX>'s database, which contains over
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51,000</NUMEX> records on cardiac surgical outcomes, is risk-adjusted for
severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> on the basis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> variables, including age and
previous medical history, collected prior to surgery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> was able
to identify the differences in surgical outcomes among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> VHA
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> performing cardiac surgery. On the basis of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> recommended a number of techniques and processes for
shortening the postoperative hospital stay, decreasing excessive
diagnostic testing, and reducing the risk of postoperative
infections or complications. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX>, because it adopted
these and other techniques, the performance data show that cardiac
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> lowered their mortality rates for all cardiac procedures over
the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 years</TIMEX> by an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 percent</NUMEX>.
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> data analysis effort is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">External Peer Review</ENAMEX>
Program. The program compares <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>' performances
against established community standards. As part of the effort,
panels composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> not affiliated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> review
medical records to determine if community standards have been met.
One performance gap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> identified through this benchmarking was
the low vaccination rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> and chronically ill VHA
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are at high risk for contracting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of
potentially fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> has worked with the National
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute on Aging</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Lung Association</ENAMEX> to raise its <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX>
immunization rate for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 percent to 29 percent</NUMEX>
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 2 years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX> also is analyzing performance data to switch some of its
focus from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inpatient</ENAMEX> to ambulatory care. For example, according to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VHA</ENAMEX>, after careful data analysis, its medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, determined that only a small percentage of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX> inpatient detoxification program
needed acute medical attention. As a result, the program was
converted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1995</TIMEX> to an outpatient program with
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/GGD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-118</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and Results
Act
only a small inpatient capacity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> reportedly now
serves more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> fewer full-time staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and
anticipates that savings from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> of the new outpatient
program will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600,000</NUMEX>-with no lessening in the quality of
patient care.
No picture of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is accomplishing with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>' money can be complete without adequate program cost and
performance information. But this information must be presented in
a way that is useful to the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> who rely on it to help
them assess and manage federal programs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Viewing</ENAMEX> program
performance in light of program costs-for instance, by establishing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost per output or outcome achieved-can be important on at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> levels. First, it can help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> make informed
decisions. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it can give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> a better understanding
of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is providing in return for their tax
dollars.
Consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>'s requirement that annual performance plans
be tied to budget requests, the annual performance reports, which
are to report progress toward achieving the goals established in
the plans, are to link levels of performance to the budget
expenditures. Directly calculating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost information will
likely become more widespread when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Management Reform</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1994</ENAMEX> (GMRA) is implemented. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMRA</ENAMEX> authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, upon proper
notification to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, to consolidate and simplify management
reports. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX> has proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> prepare two
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> reports: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning and Budgeting Report</ENAMEX> and an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountability Report</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consolidated reports would be used
to present each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s past financial and program performance and
provide a roadmap for its future planning and budgeting actions. At
present, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> is having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> produce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountability Reports</ENAMEX>
on a pilot basis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountability Report</ENAMEX> would eliminate the
separate requirements under various laws-such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Financial Integrity Act</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prompt</ENAMEX>

requirements. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forty-four</ENAMEX> pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> submitted reports for
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round of performance reporting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. We identified
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> features that when viewed as a whole, appear to
have the potential for enhancing the general usefulness of future
performance reports in providing decisionmakers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> with
the information needed to assess progress<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> These features would
also be appropriate for GMRA accountability reports.
Our initial observations suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> performance reports
are likely to be more useful if they


•
describe the relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s annual
performance and its strategic goals and mission,


•
include cost information,


•
provide baseline and trend data,


•
explain the uses of performance information,


•
incorporate other relevant information, and


•
present performance information in a user-friendly
manner.


By describing how the annual performance information it has
reported relates to its strategic goals and mission, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> can
help its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and stakeholders understand the relationship
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the year</TIMEX>'s accomplishments and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s long-range
goals and reason for existence. By including cost
information-ideally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost per output or outcome-the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> can
demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and productivity of its program
efforts. In addition, by providing baseline and trend data-which
show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s progress over time-the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> can give
decisionmakers a more historical perspective within which to
compare the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s performance with performance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past years</TIMEX>.
Similarly, by explaining the uses of the performance
information-such as the actions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has taken or identified
as needed, based on the data-the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> can help decisionmakers
judge the reasonableness of its performance goals and decide upon
actions they may need to take to improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s performance.
The report should include any other information that is
relevant-such as the limitations in the quality of the reported
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>-that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the report may need to help them better
understand the performance data and its context. It is important,
as well, that the text be understandable to the nontechnical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX>-that it use clearly defined terms and appropriate,
user-friendly tables and graphs to convey information as readily as
possible.

Practice <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">8: Use Performance Information to Support Mission</ENAMEX>
As efforts continue to reduce federal spending, policymakers and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> alike are reexamining the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s spending
priorities. Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are feeling the pressure to
demonstrate that they are putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>' money to sound
use. They are expected to demonstrate improved performance even as
they cut costs-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> simultaneous demands that are driving the trend
toward results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
As they focus on the outcomes they hope to achieve, federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> increasingly are finding that the traditional ways they
measured their success-and thus the traditional ways they did
business and provided services-are no longer appropriate or
practical. For example, the new focus on outcomes is prompting some
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to alter the approach of their programs, including
working more closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> create information systems to provide them
with cost and performance data, they discover that having the facts
gives them a basis for focusing their efforts and improving their
performance.


Case Illustration: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>
The mission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Marine Safety</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection</ENAMEX> is to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, the
environment, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic interests through the prevention and mitigation
ofmarine incidents. In the past, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>'s marine safety
program concentrated on the physical condition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, through
activities such as inspections and certifications. The program
focused less attention on the human factors that contribute to
marine safety. But as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> became more outcome-oriented and
made more extensive use of performance information, it began to
redirect its safety efforts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> data indicate that its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>-effectiveness is now dramatically improved.
Traditionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> based its marine safety efforts
on inspections and certifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>. It measured its
performance by counting outputs, such as the number of prior
inspections and outstanding inspection results. But the data on
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casualties</ENAMEX> indicated that accidents were often caused, not
by deficiencies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> or other factors, but by human
error. For example, towing industry data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982 through 1991</TIMEX>
showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 percent</NUMEX> of reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casualties</ENAMEX> were caused by

<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> business plan, dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1994</TIMEX>. After all, it came to
recognize, the mission of the marine safety program was not to do
more and better inspections of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, but to save lives. As a
result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> shifted its resources and realigned its
processes away from inspections and toward other efforts to reduce
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marine</ENAMEX> casualties. In addition, it identified a significant role
for the towing industry in the marine safety program and looked for
opportunities to work with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in the towing industry
to reduce casualties in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> and the towing industry worked to build the
knowledge and skills of entry-level crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the industry.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> and the towing industry jointly developed training
and voluntary guidelines to reduce the causes of fatalities. This
joint effort contributed to a significant decline in the reported
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towing</ENAMEX> industry fatality rate: from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">91</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> industry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
The marine safety program apparently not only improved its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> effectiveness, but did so with fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and at lower
cost. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>'s marine safety program became a GPRA
pilot program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1994</TIMEX>, the number of direct program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> declined and its budget was reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX>.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>, the program achieved its results by
giving field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> greater authority and by investing in
activities and processes that went most directly to the goal of
reducing risks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> will not succeed without the strong commitment of the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s political and senior career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. Only
they can ensure that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s strategic planning and
performance measurement efforts will become the basis for its
day-to-day operations. Moreover, only they can ensure that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">results-oriented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will endure despite the customarily
high rate of turnover among political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointees</ENAMEX>.25 Some of the
practices they can take to reinforce results-oriented management
are to


•
devolve decisionmaking authority within a framework of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>-oriented processes in exchange for accountability for
results,


•
create incentives to encourage a focus on
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">outcomes,</ENAMEX>


•
build expertise in the necessary skills, and


•
integrate management reforms.


If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> is to thrive over the long run, its concepts need to be
made a part of organizational culture. For that to happen, the top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has to initiate results-oriented
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> focused on it, and embed its principles
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s basic approach to doing business.26


Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9</TIMEX>: Devolve Decisionmaking With Accountability
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied create a set of mission-related
processes and systems within which to operate, but they then give
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> extensive authority to pursue organizational goals
while using those processes and systems. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> invest
the time and effort to understand their processes and how those
processes contribute to or hamper mission accomplishment. They then
seek to ensure their processes provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at each
organizational level with the authority and flexibility they need
to contribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s mission. Allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to
bring their judgment to bear in meeting their responsibilities,
rather than having them merely comply with overly rigid rules and
standards, can help them make the most of their talents and lead to
more effective and efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
In our work with foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that have adopted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">results-oriented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, we found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reforms in
particular were aimed at enhancing accountability among line
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>: simplifying the rules for such things as budgeting and
human resource <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> while

devolving decisionmaking authority<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.27</NUMEX> These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reforms were
undertaken in exchange for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> assuming greater accountability
for the results of their programs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> generally welcomed
their new authority to make spending, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and operational
decisions that had formerly been made by central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. But
although these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> were generally satisfied with the progress
they had made, they continued to struggle with a number of
important issues, such as the acceptable level of risk and the
extent to which decisionmaking authority should be devolved to a
given organizational level.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Civil Works Directorate</ENAMEX>'s
Operation and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maintenance Program</ENAMEX> is responsible for the
stewardship of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX>, levees, and other parts of the water resources
infrastructure constructed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX>. Operation and maintenance
expenditures had become by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1990</TIMEX> the single largest
individual program item in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX>' budget. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, faced with
rising budget pressures, a growing project inventory, and the need
to become more results-oriented, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX> initiated a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> review of its civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> and maintenance
program.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> major finding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> plan of improvement was the
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">burdensome</ENAMEX> number of internal levels of review. At the majority of
project sites, for example, procurement of items costing less than
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> required between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and five</NUMEX> signatures; each approval
beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> added to the time required for the procurement
and created inefficiency, revenue loss, and a potential danger to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and public when safety corrections were delayed.
To remedy this situation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX> changed its processes by
decentralizing its organizational structure and giving project
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> new decisionmaking authority to help them achieve the
desired outcomes. The intent of these changes was to put key
operational decisions in the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who were closest
to the point of customer service. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> could now focus
on, and be held accountable for, achieving goals instead of merely
complying with rules. Now procurements of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $25,000</NUMEX> can be
approved by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>.
As part of this new approach, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX> reformed its processes,
revising its policies and procedures to ensure that only those that
were necessary remained. It achieved this reduction, by and large,
by indicating "what"

Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>: Create Incentives
was to be accomplished and leaving the "how" to the initiative
of project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Eighty-nine engineering regulations were thereby
consolidated into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, and the number of pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX>' regulations
was reduced from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,596 to 306</NUMEX>.
This streamlining of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and processes allowed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX> to reduce the number of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> levels. By the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX>'
estimate, the savings created amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $6 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>
and a reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> full-time equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
Across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the best incentive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the executive
branch can apply to foster results-oriented management is to use
performance measurement data in their policy, program, and resource
allocation decisions and to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with the authority and
flexibility to achieve results. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branch</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s top political and career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> can
encourage a greater accountability for results by providing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at each level in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> with the appropriate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> and flexibility to obtain those results.
Successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied defined their missions
clearly and communicated them to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>-particularly to
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>-so that each one would understand his or her
contribution. At both the organizational and managerial levels,
accountability requires results-oriented goals and appropriate
performance measures through which to gauge progress. Our study of
several leading foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, however, showed that although
there was general agreement on how to hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
accountable for results, there was as yet no such agreement on how
best to hold individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> held their program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable for
efficiently providing specific goods and services. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, hold their program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable
for evaluating the overall effectiveness of their programs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the executive branch continue to explore formal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> to hold individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable for results. At the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> level, however, informal incentives are available to leaders
to encourage results-oriented management. Through meetings and
personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> can let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and staff
know of their commitment to achieving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s goals and to
keeping these goals in mind as they pursue their day-to-day
activities.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Veterans Affairs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>) comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
that provide services and benefits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX>. The elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>
to cabinet-level status in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> spurred the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> to make
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> improvements. To recognize and reinforce
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">results-oriented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> instituted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> a formal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> program for quality achievement.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert W. Carey Quality Award</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>'s most prestigious award
for quality achievement. It is named for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert W. Carey</ENAMEX>, who, as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Regional Office</ENAMEX>, was a "Quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leader</ENAMEX>" and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of excellence in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey Award</ENAMEX> helps promote quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> by giving
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> a prominent means of recognizing high-performing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, encouraging outcome-oriented practices, and educating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> about the benefits of results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
customer service. According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey Award</ENAMEX> is
valuable, in part, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> that want it must apply for
it and the application itself becomes a useful self-assessment
tool.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> announced its first <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Carey Award in 1992</ENAMEX>. There is one overall

Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>: Build Expertise
To make the most of results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at all
levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> must be skilled in strategic planning,
performance measurement, and the use of performance information in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisionmaking</ENAMEX>. Training has proven to be an important tool for

government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, for example, cited training as one of the
factors that contributed the most to making reforms succeed in
their areas.30
Results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> view training as an investment rather
than an expense. And as human resource management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> at
leading private and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have pointed out,
organizational learning must be continuous in order to meet

a time when overall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> budgets are under pressure, training
budgets are unlikely to increase. Therefore, it is important that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> develop innovative and less costly ways to train their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX>-remembering as well that the level of return for investing
in the skills needed for results-oriented management will depend
largely on how well <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are encouraged to put those skills to
use.
Recognizing the value of training, especially for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at
the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA Implementation</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> has begun an outreach effort directed toward senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 24</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>'s goals are to
familiarize these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>'s fundamentals and with the
importance of these fundamentals for the future of federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.
In addition, in response to an initiative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for Public Administration</ENAMEX> and with the encouragement of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX> case studies are being developed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' use
of strategic planning or performance measurement. These case
studies, to be completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1996</TIMEX>, are to be made
publicly available.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> (DOD) is responsible for the military
forces needed to deter war and protect the security of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service branches</ENAMEX>-the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>-consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1.5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> on active duty, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the reserve components, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 900,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian employees</ENAMEX>. As with other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, performance
information is becoming an increasingly important part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s
budget process. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> has come to recognize that if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> is to make results-oriented management a success, it
must train its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in strategic planning, performance
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, and the use of performance information.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> recognized when they were considering various
methods to deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> training that the costs-in both money and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-of providing training through traditional, live classroom
instruction would be prohibitive. As an alternative, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> is now
testing the feasibility of training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> pilot
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX>. This interactive approach can reach widely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispersed audiences</ENAMEX> less expensively than traditional methods. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> course originates out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> and has been broadcast
simultaneously to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Since the
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrate Management Reforms</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> training has been
delivered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times via <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and has reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">760</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
In developing its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> training, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> decided to go beyond the
traditional lecture approach to instruction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> training has
included exercises and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> discussions designed to make trainees
think the way they will need to when the training is over and the
real work of implementing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> begins. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> have been
asked, for instance, to develop mission statements for their home
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and to develop strategic goals and performance
measures. According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> have been well
received.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> is also developing a self-paced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> course accessible on
the Internet and is considering the use of CD-ROM technology.
Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, the management reforms now under
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> may spring from various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Some of these reforms may be
self-initiated, others may have been mandated by legislation, still
others may be the result of administration initiatives such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Performance Review</ENAMEX>. All of this reform activity needs to
be integrated, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX> urged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1995</TIMEX>:
Existing planning, budgeting, program evaluation and fiscal
accountability processes should be integrated with GPRA
requirements to ensure consistency and reduce duplication of
effort. In addition, other management improvement efforts, such as
implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMFIA</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Managers</ENAMEX>'
Financial <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Integrity Act</ENAMEX>], customer service initiatives,
reengineering, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Total Quality Management</ENAMEX>, etc., should be
incorporated into the GPRA framework to capitalize on the synergy
and availability of key information and to improve responsiveness
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and other stakeholders<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.32</NUMEX>
Another management reform initiative that provides a legislative
basis for measuring performance is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology</ENAMEX>
Management <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reform Act of 1996</ENAMEX>, which requires each federal agency
to ensure that performance measures are prescribed for information
technology that it will use or acquire and that the performance
measures assess how well the information technology supports agency
programs. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of each executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to approve or
define the cost, performance, and schedule goals for major agency
acquisition programs.

Taken together, these reforms can help redirect an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s culture from the traditional focus on inputs and
activities to a new focus on defining missions and achieving
results<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.33</NUMEX> Our work has shown, however, that the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of
each federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> needs to meld these various reforms into a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coherent</ENAMEX>, unified effort<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX> Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>-both political and
career-needs to make clear its commitment to the fundamental
principles of results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at all levels recognize that they must do the same.
Traditionally, the danger to any management reform is that it can
become a hollow, paper-driven exercise. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX> who integrate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">results-oriented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> into the culture and day-to-day
activities of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> will help avoid that danger.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Research Laboratory</ENAMEX> (ARL) was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> as a result of a realignment of a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> research and
development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. It is now the central laboratory of the
Army <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Materiel Command</ENAMEX>. At a time when both staffing levels and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funding</ENAMEX> had been in decline since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1989</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARL</ENAMEX> was given a
major technological challenge-digitizing the battlefield for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARL</ENAMEX> concluded that to ensure that it had the capability
to meet the new challenge and continue to conduct its mission of
basic and applied research, it had to work in partnership with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> and the private sector, as well as operate more
effectively and efficiently. This "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Laboratory</ENAMEX>" concept
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guided ARL</ENAMEX> as it integrated the various management reforms.
As a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> pilot program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARL</ENAMEX> developed a strategic plan that
included a mission statement and long-range goals. In addition, it
has produced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two yearly</TIMEX> products: a performance plan with key
measures and a report detailing its progress in meeting its goals.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> reports have been integrated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARL</ENAMEX>'s planning and
budgeting processes and are discussed by agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> meetings. In addition, the reports have been
tied into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Programming</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX>, and Execution
System. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARL</ENAMEX>'s performance measures gauge the relevance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARL</ENAMEX>'s
current work to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s long-term goals and give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARL</ENAMEX>'s leaders
indicators of productivity and quality. As part of its

As a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">National Performance Review</ENAMEX> "reinvention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>," ARL
has been granted waivers by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> from internal
regulations in order to streamline its processes. For example, one
such waiver allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARL</ENAMEX> to eliminate redundant reviews of certain
procurements, thereby saving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> workdays on each procurement. Saving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on administrative processes frees <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to perform the
principal mission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>.
Facing pressures similar to those confronting federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
to reduce costs and improve performance, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> have responded by implementing management reform
efforts consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>. The experiences of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>-and those of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>-demonstrate that
each federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will need to chart its own course in response
to its specific environment as it seeks to implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> and
become more results-oriented. Nonetheless, the experiences of the
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> suggest that the steps and practices
discussed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> can assist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in successfully
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implementing GPRA</ENAMEX>. Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that apply the practices may
find that their transition to a results orientation is quicker,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smoother</ENAMEX>, and, most important, more successful in providing the
effective and efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> deserve.
Appendix I



Overview of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and Results Act
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Performance and Results Act</ENAMEX> (GPRA) is the primary
legislative framework through which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> will be required to
set strategic goals, measure performance, and report on the degree
to which goals were met. It requires each federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to
develop, no later than by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of fiscal year 1997</TIMEX>, strategic
plans that cover a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 5 years</TIMEX> and include the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency's</ENAMEX> mission statement; identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s long-term
strategic goals; and describe how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> intends to achieve
those goals through its activities and through its human, capital,
information, and other resources. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GPRA</ENAMEX>, agency strategic
plans are the starting point for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> goals for
programs and to measure the performance of the programs in
achieving those goals.
Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> requires each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to submit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>), beginning for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>, an
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> performance plan. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> performance plans are to
be submitted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1997</TIMEX>. The annual performance plan is to
provide the direct linkage between the strategic goals outlined in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s strategic plan and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> do
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day-to-day</ENAMEX>. In essence, this plan is to contain the annual
performance goals the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will use to gauge its progress toward
accomplishing its strategic goals and identify the performance
measures the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will use to assess its progress. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> will
use individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' performance plans to develop an overall
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> performance plan that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> is to submit annually
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s budget, beginning for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> requires that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> submit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and to
the appropriate authorization and appropriations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> an annual report on program performance for the previous
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX> (copies are to be provided to other congressional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> and to the public upon request). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of these
reports, on program performance for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>, is due by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31, 2000</TIMEX>, and subsequent reports are due by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31</TIMEX> for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that follow. However, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 2000 and 2001</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' reports are to include performance data beginning with
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each subsequent year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are to include
performance data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> covered by the report and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> prior
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
In each report, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is to review and discuss its
performance compared with the performance goals it established in
its annual performance plan. When a goal is not met, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> is to explain the reasons the goal was not met; plans and
schedules for meeting the goal; and, if the goal was impractical or
not feasible, the reasons for that and the actions recommended.
Actions needed to accomplish a goal could
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/GGD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-118</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and Results
Act
include legislative, regulatory, or other actions or, when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> found a goal to be impractical or infeasible, a discussion
of whether the goal ought to be modified.
In addition to evaluating the progress made toward achieving
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> goals established in the performance plan for the fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> covered by the report, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s program performance report
is to evaluate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s performance plan for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year</TIMEX> in
which the performance report was submitted (for example, in their
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX> performance reports, due by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31, 2000</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are required to evaluate their performance plans for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX> on the basis of their reported performance in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>). This evaluation will help to show how an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s actual performance is influencing its plans. Finally, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> is to include the summary findings of program evaluations
completed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year</TIMEX> covered by the report.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recognized that in some cases not all of the
performance data will be available in time for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31</TIMEX>
reporting date. In such cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are to provide whatever
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are available, with a notation as to their incomplete status.
Subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> reports are to include the complete data as part
of the trend information.
In crafting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> also recognized that managerial
accountability for results is linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> having sufficient
flexibility, discretion, and authority to accomplish desired
results. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GPRA</ENAMEX> authorizes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to apply for managerial
flexibility waivers in their annual performance plans beginning
with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to request waivers
of administrative procedural requirements and controls is intended
to provide federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> with more flexibility to structure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> systems to better support program goals. The nonstatutory
requirements that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> can waive under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> generally involve the
allocation and use of resources, such as restrictions on shifting
funds among items within a budget account. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> must report in
their annual performance reports on the use and effectiveness of
any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> managerial flexibility waivers that they receive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> calls for phased implementation so that selected pilot
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can develop experience from implementing
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GPRA</ENAMEX> requirements in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1994 through 1996</TIMEX> before
implementation is required for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1996</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>
pilot projects for performance planning and performance reporting
were under way in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> also is required to select at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> from among the initial pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to
pilot
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/GGD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-118</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and Results
Act
managerial accountability and flexibility for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1995</TIMEX>
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>; however, as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1996</TIMEX> it had not done so.
Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> requires OMB to select at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of which have had experience developing performance
plans during the initial GPRA <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> phase, to test performance
budgeting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1998 and 1999</TIMEX>. Performance budgets to be
prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> projects for performance budgeting are intended
to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> with information on the direct relationship
between proposed program spending and expected program results and
the anticipated effects of varying spending levels on results.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> II


Objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
Our objectives were to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) identify and describe the practices
most helpful to successfully implementing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> and related
results-oriented management initiatives and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) provide case
illustrations of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that have made progress in
implementing each practice. This report builds on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>
report profiling leading private and public sector organizations
that have successfully improved mission performance and program
outcomes through the innovative use of information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
technology and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> report on the human resource management
principles employed by selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to
build and sustain high levels of organizational performance<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX>
Together, these reports are intended to suggest frameworks for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to use in implementing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> and
related results-oriented management initiatives.
To meet our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> objective, we reviewed the experiences of
leading public sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that were successfully changing
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and accountability practices to be more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">results-oriented</ENAMEX>. As part of that effort, we issued separate
reports on the experiences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> leading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> state and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.36 We also reviewed the management studies of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> large federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that we did during the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last decade</TIMEX> as well as a broad array of our other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
program work. To supplement our work looking at leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, we identified and reviewed a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of
literature on management reform, strategic planning, and
performance measurement. From our work, we identified a number of
practices common to successful efforts to become more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">results-oriented</ENAMEX>. We obtained input from a wide range of federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in public sector strategic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX>, performance measurement, and program and policy
evaluation, including those from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments of Defense</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personnel Management</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy of Public</ENAMEX>
Administration; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Institute</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. On the basis of their comments and our continuing
reviews of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, we consolidated and refined the
list of practices to those presented in this guide.
To meet our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> objective, we identified those federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that were instituting results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> from our
ongoing work on the implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and
large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> (covering <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 98 percent</NUMEX> of the federal
government's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1994</TIMEX> outlays) and

The methodologies for selecting these leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> are
detailed in the respective reports.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> making early progress in
implementing selected aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>. In this way, we targeted our
work toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that would provide examples illustrating each
of the practices. The fact that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is profiled for a
particular practice is not meant to imply the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> or lack of success in meeting other practices. Moreover,
underscoring the fact that implementing management changes required
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> will not come quickly, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> profiled began
their results-oriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> was enacted. We
interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, strategic planning
and quality management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and planning and evaluation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. We also reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> documents, such as strategic
plans, performance plans, performance reports, program descriptions
and documentation, and other related documents.
We did our work on this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1995 to March 1996</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. The steps and practices presented in this
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> are largely a synthesis of previously published
information and analysis.
We provided a draft of this guide to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX>'s GPRA
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Implementation Committee</ENAMEX>, and to the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> profiled
in the case illustrations for their review and comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> noted
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> and the practices suggested in it will help federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> as they implement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> also expressed support for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX>'s focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> use of performance information to improve
management and program performance and to demonstrate that federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>' money effectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> concurred with
our observation that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is at the beginning,
rather than the end, of the process of turning itself into a more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accountable</ENAMEX>, better managed, more effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. Finally,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> noted that the development and refinement of performance
measures will be an ongoing process.
We also provided copies of a draft of this guide for comment to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA Implementation</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> and incorporated their individual comments as
appropriate. Generally, their comments suggested that the steps and
practices we identified from the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> studied were
valid and complete, and that the case illustrations were accurate
