As you requested, this report examines how best practices offer
improvements to the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> develops new
weapon systems, primarily the design and manufacturing aspects of
the acquisition process. It examines the attainment of design and
manufacturing knowledge and its use at critical junctures to make
decisions about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>' readiness to move forward in the
acquisition process. We make recommendations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of
Defense for improvements to weapon system acquisition policy to
better align design and manufacturing activities with best
practices that have shown that the capture and use of key knowledge
can result in better cost, schedule, and performance outcomes.

Executive Summary
Historically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>) has taken much longer and
Purpose
spent much more than originally planned to develop and acquire
its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>, significantly reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s buying
power over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>. Clearly, it is critical to find better ways
of doing business and, in particular, to make sure that weapon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> are delivered on time and cost-effectively. This is
especially true given the vast sums <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> is spending and is expected
to spend on weapons acquisition-<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 billion</NUMEX> alone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> and an
anticipated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 5 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> has recognized
the nature of this problem and has taken steps to address it,
including advocating the use of best practices for product
development from commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
have achieved more predictable outcomes from their product
development processes because they identify and control design and
manufacturing risks early and manage them effectively. While DOD
has made some progress in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s recent weapon system
reviews show that persistent problems continue to hinder
acquisition cost, schedule, and performance outcomes. For this
reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has continued a body of work to identify the lessons
learned by best commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to see if they apply to weapon
system acquisitions.
This report addresses how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> can manage its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon system</ENAMEX>
acquisition process to ensure important knowledge about a system's
design, critical manufacturing processes, and reliability is
captured and used to make informed and timely decisions before
committing to substantial development and production investments.
It identifies best practices to facilitate this decision making at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> critical junctures-transition from system integration to system
demonstration during product development and then transition into
production. Ultimately, this should improve cost, schedule, and
quality outcomes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> major weapon system acquisitions. In
response to a request from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ranking</ENAMEX> Minority
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Member</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Armed Services</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) assessed the impact of design
and manufacturing knowledge on DOD program outcomes, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) compared
best practices to those used in DOD programs, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) analyzed
current weapon system acquisition guidance for applicability of
best practices to obtain better program outcomes.
Background
Executive Summary
In any new product development program there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> critical
points that require the capture of specific knowledge to achieve
successful outcomes. The first knowledge point occurs when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>'s requirements are clearly defined and resources-proven
technology, design, time, and money-exist to satisfy them.
Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> insist that technology be mature at the outset
of a product development program and, therefore, separate
technology development from product development. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
knowledge point is achieved when the product's design is determined
to be capable of meeting product requirements-the design is stable
and ready to begin initial manufacturing of prototypes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>
knowledge point is achieved when a reliable product can be produced
repeatedly within established cost, schedule, and quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s prior work on best practices covers achieving the first
knowledge point<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> This report examines best practices for achieving
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> knowledge points.
Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> understand the importance of capturing
design and manufacturing knowledge early in product development,
when costs to identify problems and make design changes to the
product are significantly cheaper. In a knowledge-based process,
the achievement of each successive knowledge point builds on the
preceding one, giving decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> the knowledge they need-when
they need it-to make decisions about whether to invest significant
additional funds to move forward with product development. Programs
that follow a knowledge-based approach typically have a higher
probability of successful cost and schedule outcomes. Problems
occur in programs when knowledge builds more slowly than
commitments to enter product development or production. The effects
of this delay in capturing knowledge can be debilitating. If a
decision is made to commit to develop and produce a design before
the critical technology, design, or manufacturing knowledge is
captured, problems will cascade and become magnified through the
product development and production phases. Outcomes from these
problems include increases in cost and schedule and degradations in
performance and quality.

The success of any effort to develop a new
product hinges on having the

right knowledge at the right time. Knowledge about a product's
design and producibility facilitates informed decisions about
whether to significantly increase investments and reduces the risk
of costly design changes later in the program. Every program
eventually achieves this knowledge; however, leading commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> visited have found that there is a much better
opportunity to meet predicted cost, schedule, and quality targets
when it is captured early, in preparation for critical investment
decisions. A product development process includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phases
followed by production-integration phase and demonstration phase.
The commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> visited achieved success in product
development by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> achieving a mature, stable design supported by
completed engineering drawings during an integration phase and then
by demonstrating that the product's design was reliable and
critical manufacturing processes required to build it were in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> before committing to full production. The more successful
DOD programs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reviewed-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FA-18-E/F</ENAMEX> programs-had
achieved similar knowledge as the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, resulting
in good cost and schedule outcomes. In contrast, the DOD programs,
which had completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-quarter</NUMEX> of their drawings when they
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transitioned</ENAMEX> to the demonstration phase and had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> of
their manufacturing processes in control when entering production,
experienced poor cost and schedule outcomes.
Leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> employed practices to capture
design and manufacturing knowledge in time for making key decisions
during product development. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> were most prominent. First, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> kept the degree of the design challenge manageable before
starting a new product development program by using an evolutionary
approach to develop a product. This minimized the amount of new
content and technologies on a product, making it easier to capture
the requisite knowledge about a product's design before investing
in manufacturing processes, tooling, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> captured design and manufacturing knowledge before the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> critical decision points in product development: when the
design was demonstrated to be stable-the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> knowledge point-and
when the product was demonstrated to be producible at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an affordable</NUMEX>
cost-the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> knowledge point. A key measure of design stability
was stakeholders' agreements that engineering drawings were
complete and supported by testing and prototyping when necessary. A
key measure of producibility was whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' critical
manufacturing processes were in control and product reliability was
demonstrated. Most DOD programs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reviewed did not complete
engineering drawings prior to entering the demonstration phase, nor
did they bring critical manufacturing processes in control or
demonstrate reliability prior to making a production decision.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> has made changes to its acquisition <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">policy2</TIMEX> in an attempt to
improve its framework for developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>, but the policy
does not require the capture of design or manufacturing knowledge
or sufficient criteria to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration and
production phases. In addition, it does not require a decision
review to enter the demonstration phase of product development.
Further, there is little incentive for DOD program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to
capture knowledge early in the development process. Instead, the
acquisition environment emphasizes delaying knowledge capture and
problem identification since these events can have a negative
influence on obtaining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> program funding-a key to success for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>. In contrast, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> encourage their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to capture product design and manufacturing knowledge to
identify and resolve problems early in development, before making
significant increases in their investment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is making recommendations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s acquisition process to achieve better
outcomes by incorporating best practices to capture design and
manufacturing knowledge and then use this knowledge as a basis for
decisions to commit significant additional time and money as an
acquisition program progresses through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration and
into production.

Principal Findings
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Timely Design and Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX>
Is Critical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Program Success</ENAMEX>
Knowledge that a product's design is stable early in the program
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilitates</ENAMEX> informed decisions about whether to significantly
increase investments and reduces the risk of costly design changes
that can result from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unknowns</ENAMEX> after initial manufacturing begins.
Likewise, later knowledge that the design can be manufactured
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affordably</ENAMEX> and with consistent high quality prior to making a
production decision ensures that targets for cost and schedule
during production will be met. Leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> do not
make significant investments to continue a product development or
its production until they have knowledge that the product's design
works and it can be manufactured efficiently within cost and
schedule expectations.
DOD programs that captured knowledge similar to commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> had more successful outcomes. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18E/F</ENAMEX> captured design and manufacturing knowledge by key
decision points and limited cost increases to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX> or less and
schedule growth to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> or less. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>
percent of its drawings completed at its critical design review.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18E/F</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 percent</NUMEX> of its drawings completed and also had
over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of its higher level interface drawings completed,
adding confidence in the system design. Both took steps to ensure
that manufacturing processes were capable of producing an
affordable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> by the time the programs made production
decisions.
On the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Threat Infrared</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Countermeasures/Common Missile Warning System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX>)
programs did not capture sufficient knowledge before significant
investments to continue the programs and experienced cost growth
that ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 to 182 percent</NUMEX> and schedule delays that ranged
from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months to over 3 years</TIMEX>. None of these programs had
completed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 26 percent</NUMEX> of their engineering drawings for
their critical design reviews, and only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-3</ENAMEX> programs
attempted to track the capability of their critical manufacturing
processes prior to production.
Best <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Practices Enable Timely Capture</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design and Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX>
Leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> developed practices that enabled
the timely capture of design and manufacturing knowledge. First,
they used an evolutionary approach to product development by
establishing timephased plans to develop a new product in
increments based on technologies and resources achievable now and
later. This approach reduced the amount of risk in the development
of each increment, facilitating greater success in meeting cost,
schedule, and performance requirements. The commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> visited used the evolutionary approach as their method for
product development. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had a plan for eventually
achieving a quantum leap in the performance of its products and had
established an orderly, phased process for getting there, by
undertaking continuous product improvements as resources became
available. For the most part, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> programs try to achieve the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leap</ENAMEX> in performance but in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> step, contributing to
development times that can take over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX> to deliver a new
capability to the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, each leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had a product
development process that was prominent and central to its success.
The process was championed by executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and embraced by
product <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> as an effective way to do
business. Critical to the product development process were
activities that enabled the capture of specific design and
manufacturing knowledge and decision reviews to determine if the
knowledge captured would support the increased investment necessary
to move to the next development phase or into production. These
activities provided knowledge that the product design was stable at
the decision point to start initial manufacturing (exiting the
integration phase) as demonstrated by the completion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX>
of the engineering drawings. They also captured knowledge that a
product was ready to begin production (exiting the demonstration
phase) as demonstrated by proof that critical processes were in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and product reliability was achievable. The activities that
enabled the capture and use of this knowledge to make decisions are
listed in table 1.

DOD programs that had more successful outcomes used key best
practices to a greater degree than others. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-9X
missile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> completed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> of its engineering drawings at
the critical design review because it made extensive use of
prototype testing to demonstrate the design met requirements
coupled with design reviews that included program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18-E/F</ENAMEX> program eliminated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 40 percent</NUMEX> of the parts used to
build predecessor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to make the design more robust for
manufacturing and identified critical manufacturing processes,
bringing them under control before the start of production. Both
programs developed products that evolved from existing versions,
making the design challenge more manageable.
On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> programs with less successful outcomes
did not apply best practices to a great extent. At their initial
manufacturing decision reviews, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX>
had less than onethird of their engineering drawings, in part,
because they did not use prototypes to demonstrate the design met
requirements before starting initial manufacturing. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX>
program, it was almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years</TIMEX> after this review before <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX>
of the drawings needed to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> were completed. Likewise,
at their production decision reviews, these programs did not
capture manufacturing and product reliability knowledge consistent
with best practices. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-3</ENAMEX> missile program had
less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of its processes in control and, as a result,
the missile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> had to be built, tested, and reworked on
average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> times before they were acceptable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> entered
production despite being substantially behind its plan to achieve
reliability goals. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> is requiring significantly
more maintenance actions than planned.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Match of Policy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Incentives Is</ENAMEX>
Needed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensure Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s acquisition policy establishes a good framework for
developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>; however, more specific criteria,
disciplined adherence, and stronger acquisition incentives are
needed to ensure the timely capture and use of knowledge and
decision making. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> recently changed its acquisition policy to
emphasize evolutionary acquisition and establish separate
integration and demonstration phases in the product development
process. Its goal was to develop higher quality systems in less
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and for less cost. While similar to the leading commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' approach, the policy lacks detailed criteria for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capturing</ENAMEX> and using design and manufacturing knowledge to
facilitate better decisions and more successful acquisition program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>. It also lacks a decision review to proceed from the
integration phase to the demonstration phase of product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>.
While the right policy and criteria are necessary to ensure a
disciplined, knowledge-based product development process, the
incentives that influence the key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in the acquisition
process will ultimately determine whether they will be used
effectively. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>, current incentives are geared toward delaying
knowledge so as not to jeopardize program funding. This undermines
a knowledge-based process for making product development decisions.
Instead, program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> push the capture of
design and manufacturing knowledge to later in the development
program to avoid the identification of problems that might stop or
limit funding. They focus more on meeting schedules than capturing
knowledge. On the other hand, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> must develop
high-quality products quickly or they may not survive in the
marketplace. Because of this, they encourage their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to
capture product design and manufacturing knowledge to identify and
resolve problems early in development, before making significant
increases in their investment. Instead of a schedule-driven
process, their process is driven by events that bring them
knowledge: critical design reviews that are supported by completed
engineering drawings and production decisions supported by
reliability testing and statistical process control data. They do
not move forward without the design and manufacturing knowledge
needed to make informed decisions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> recommends that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of
Defense revise policy and guidance
Recommendations for

on the operation of the defense
acquisition system to include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a requirement to capture specific
design knowledge to be used as exit criteria for transitioning from
system integration to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a requirement that the current optional interim progress
review between system integration and demonstration be a mandatory
decision review requiring the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> to verify that design
is stable and that this be reported in the program's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
Acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Summary and Selected Acquisition Report</ENAMEX>. The
policy and guidance should also be revised to include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a
requirement to capture and use specific manufacturing knowledge at
the production commitment point as exit criteria to transition from
system demonstration into production and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a requirement to
structure major <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon system</ENAMEX> contracts to ensure the capture and
use of knowledge for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> to make investment decisions at critical
junctures when transitioning from system integration to system
demonstration and then into production.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> generally agreed with the report and
its recommendations. A detailed

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chapter 1</ENAMEX>
Introduction
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> (DOD) spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to $100 billion</NUMEX>
annually to research, develop, and acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>, and this
investment is expected to grow substantially. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 5</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2003</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s request for weapon
system development and acquisition funds is estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX> (see fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
How effectively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> manages these funds will determine whether
it receives a good return on its investment. Our reviews over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 20 years</TIMEX> have consistently found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s weapon system
acquisitions take much longer and cost much more than originally
anticipated, causing disruptions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s overall
investment strategy and significantly reducing its buying power.
Because such disruptions can limit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s ability to effectively
execute war-fighting operations, it is critical to find better ways
of doing business.
In view of the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>,
we have undertaken an extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of work that examines <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s
acquisition issues from a different, more cross-cutting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that draws lessons learned from the best commercial
product development efforts to see if they apply to weapon system
acquisitions. This report looks at the core of the acquisition
process, specifically product development and ways to successfully
design and manufacture the product. Our previous reports looked at
such issues as how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> needs and resources,
tested products, assured quality, and managed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> and are
listed in related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> products at the end of the report.
Best Practices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leading Commercial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX>

Source: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>.
Leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> expect their program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to
deliver high-quality products on time and within budget. Doing
otherwise could result in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> walking away. Thus, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have created an environment and adopted practices that
put their program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in a good position to succeed in meeting
these expectations. Collectively, these practices ensure that a
high level of knowledge exists about critical facets of the product
at key junctures during development. Such a knowledgebased process
enables decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to be reasonably certain about critical
facets of the product under development when they need this
knowledge.
To ensure the right level of knowledge at each key decision
point in product development, leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> separate
technology from product development and take steps to ensure the
product design is stabilized early so product performance and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">producibility</ENAMEX> can be demonstrated before production. The process
followed by leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, illustrated in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, can be
broken down into the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> knowledge points.


•
Knowledge point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> occurs when a match is made between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>'s needs and the available resources-technology, design,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, and funding. To achieve this match, technologies needed to
meet essential product requirements must be demonstrated to work in
their intended environment. In addition, the product <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> must
complete a preliminary product design using systems engineering to
balance customer desires with available resources.


•
Knowledge point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> occurs when the product's design
demonstrates its ability to meet performance requirements. Program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are confident that the design is stable and will perform
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptably</ENAMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 90 percent</NUMEX> of engineering drawings are
complete. Engineering drawings reflect the results of testing and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulation</ENAMEX> and describe how the product should be built.


•
Knowledge point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> occurs when the product can be
manufactured within cost, schedule, and quality targets and is
reliable. An important indicator of this is when critical
manufacturing processes are in control and consistently producing
items within quality standards and tolerances. Another indicator is
when a product's reliability is demonstrated through iterative
testing that identifies and corrects design problems.


Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Knowledge-based Process for Applying Best Practices to</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development of New Products</ENAMEX>

Source: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s analysis.
This report focuses on best practices for achieving knowledge
points <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 3</TIMEX>, particularly at how successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> design and
manufacture a product within established cost, schedule, and
quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. The concepts discussed build on our previous
reports, which looked at the earlier phases of an acquisition,
including matching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> needs and available resources.
A key success factor evident in all our work is the ability to
obtain the right knowledge at the right time and to build knowledge
to the point that decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> can make informed decisions about
moving ahead to the next phase. Programs that do this typically
have successful cost and schedule outcomes. Programs that do not
typically encounter problems that eventually cascade and become
magnified through the product development and production phases. As
shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the effects of not following a knowledge-based
process can be debilitating.

Development

a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Product's Development Can Take</ENAMEX>
Source: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s analysis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> has historically developed new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX> in a highly
concurrent environment that usually forces acquisition programs to
manage technology, design, and manufacturing risk at the same time.
This environment has made it difficult for either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DOD</ENAMEX> or
congressional decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to make informed decisions because
appropriate knowledge has not been available at key decision points
in product development. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s common practice for managing this
environment has been to create aggressive risk reduction efforts in
its programs. Cost reduction initiatives that typically arise after
a program is experiencing problems are common tools used to manage
these risks. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> shows the overlapping and concurrent approach
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> uses to develop its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>. This figure shows that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> continues to capture technology, design, and manufacturing
knowledge long after a program passes through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the three</TIMEX>
knowledge points when this knowledge should have been available for
program decisions.

Development

More important, the problems created by this concurrent approach
on individual programs can profoundly affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s overall
modernization plans. It is difficult to prioritize and allocate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> budgets among needed requirements when acquisition
programs' cost and schedule are always in question. Programs that
are managed without the knowledge-based process are more likely to
have surprises in the form of cost and schedule increases that are
accommodated by disrupting the funding of other programs. Because
of these disruptions, decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> are not able to focus on a
balanced investment strategy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> is taking steps to change the culture
of the acquisition community
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s Adoption of

with actions aimed at reducing
product development cycle times and improving the predictability of
cost and schedule outcomes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> recently made constructive changes
to its acquisition policy that embrace best
Objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
practices. These changes focused primarily on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) ensuring
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> are demonstrated to a high level of maturity before
beginning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon system</ENAMEX> program and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) taking an evolutionary,
or phased, approach to developing new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>. Because these
changes occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 and 2001</TIMEX>, it is too early to determine how
effectively they will be put into practice. While these are good
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> steps, further use of best practices in product development
would provide a greater opportunity to improve weapon system cost
and schedule outcomes.
Our overall objective was to determine whether best practices
offer methods to improve the way DOD ensures that the design is
stable early in the development process and whether having
manufacturing processes in control before production results in
better cost, schedule, and quality outcomes in DOD major
acquisition programs. Specifically, we identified best practices
that have led to more successful product development and production
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>, compared the best practices to those used in DOD
programs, and analyzed current weapon system acquisition guidance
for applicability of best practices.
To determine the best practices for ensuring product design and
manufacturing maturity from the commercial sector, we conducted
general literature searches. On the basis of our literature
searches and discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, we identified a number of
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> as having innovative development processes and
practices that resulted in successful product development. We
visited the following commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>:


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> designs and manufactures construction and
mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and industrial
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> turbines. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, it reported sales and revenues totaling
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20.45 billion</NUMEX>. We visited its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peoria</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engine Business group</ENAMEX>) designs and
manufactures diesel and natural gas engines ranging in size from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500</NUMEX> horsepower for mining, construction, agriculture, rail,
oil and gas, heavy and mediumduty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor homes</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engine Business Group</ENAMEX> reported sales of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.1 billion</NUMEX>.
We visited its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Aircraft Engines</ENAMEX> designs and
manufactures jet engines for civil and military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> and gas
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">turbines</ENAMEX>, derived from its successful jet engine programs, for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marine</ENAMEX> and industrial applications.


In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, it reported earnings totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11.4 billion</NUMEX>. We visited
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Evendale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> designs and manufactures computing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and imaging and printing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> for individual and
business use. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, it reported revenues totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$45.2 billion</NUMEX>.
We visited its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> involved in the design and manufacturing of
complex ink jet imaging equipment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Corvallis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox Corporation</ENAMEX> designs and manufactures office
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>, including color and black and white printers, digital
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presses</ENAMEX>, multifunction devices, and digital copiers designed for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and production-printing environments. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, it reported
revenues totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16.5 billion</NUMEX>. We visited its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.


At each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, we conducted structured
interviews with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to gather uniform and consistent
information about each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s new product development processes
and best practices. During meetings with these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, we
obtained a detailed description of the processes and practices they
believed necessary and vital to mature a product design and get
manufacturing processes under control. We met with design
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>, program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, manufacturing and quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> of the knowledge-based processes and policies.
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 5 years</TIMEX>, we have gathered information on product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> practices from such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3M</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Commercial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airplane Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bombardier Aerospace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Space and Communications</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>. This information enabled us to develop an overall
model to describe the general approach leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
take to develop new products.
Our report highlights several best practices in product
development based on our fieldwork. As such, they are not intended
to describe all practices or suggest that commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are
without flaws. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> from the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visited</ENAMEX> told us that the development of their best practices has
evolved over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> and that the practices continue to be
improved based on lessons learned and new ideas and information.
They admit that the application and use of these have not always
been consistent or without error. However, they strongly suggested
that the probability of success in developing new products is
greatly enhanced by the use of these practices. Further, because of
the sensitivity to how data that would show the actual outcomes of
new product development efforts might affect their competitive
standing, we did not obtain specific cost, schedule, and
performance data. Most examples provided by these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were
anecdotal. However, the continued success of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in a competitive marketplace indicated that their practices
were important and key to their operations. Furthermore, based on
our observations during meetings at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, it was
apparent that because of the level of detailed process tools
developed for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> these best
practices were a centerpiece of their operations.
Next, we compared and contrasted the best practices with product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> practices used in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> major acquisition programs.
Below is a brief description of each program we examined:


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighter aircraft</ENAMEX> program. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> is
designed with advanced features to allow it to be less detectable
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX>, capable of high speeds for long ranges, and able to
provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> with improved awareness of the surrounding
situation through the use of integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">avionics</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> program
began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> and entered limited production in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
expects to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">341</NUMEX> at a total acquisition cost (development and
procurement) estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$69.7 billion</NUMEX>.


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Patriot Advanced Capability</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) missile program.
This program is intended to enhance the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Patriot system</ENAMEX>, an
air-defense, guided missile system. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-3</ENAMEX> is designed to enhance
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Patriot</ENAMEX> radar's ability to detect and identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>,
increase system computer capabilities, improve communications,
increase the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> in each launcher, and incorporate a
new "hit-to-kill" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>. The "hit-to-kill" missile capabilities
represent a major part of the development program, as these are not
capabilities included in prior versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patriot</ENAMEX> system. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">missile</ENAMEX> program began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> and entered limited production in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> plans to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,159</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> at a total acquisition
cost estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8.5 billion</NUMEX>.


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures/Common</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Missile Warning System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX>) program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX> is a
defensive countermeasure system for protection against infrared
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">guided</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. The common missile warning system <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">detects missiles</ENAMEX>
in flight, and the advanced threat infrared countermeasure defeats
the missile


with the use of a laser. The combined system is designed for
helicopter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The common missile warning system is also designed
for
tactical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>. The program began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
and is
expected to start limited production in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> and the
Special
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations Command</ENAMEX> plan to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,078</NUMEX> systems at a total
acquisition
cost estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.9 billion</NUMEX>.


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> missile program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-9X</ENAMEX> is an infrared, short
range, air-to-air <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> carried by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> fighter
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> is an extensive upgrade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9M</NUMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-9X</ENAMEX> is planned to have increased resistance to countermeasures

We selected these programs for review based on cost, schedule,

considered them to be in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic categories-successful and

selection was to compare and contrast the development practices

For each program, we interviewed key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and design and

Junctures
The success of any effort to develop a new product hinges on
having the right knowledge at the right time. Every program
eventually achieves this knowledge; however, leading commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we visited have found that there is a much better
opportunity to meet predicted cost, schedule, and quality targets
when it is captured early, in preparation for critical decisions.
Specifically, knowledge that a product's design is stable early in
the program facilitates informed decisions about whether to
significantly increase investments and reduces the risk of costly
design changes that can result from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unknowns</ENAMEX> after initial
manufacturing begins. This knowledge comes in the form of completed
engineering drawings before transitioning from the system
integration phase to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration phase of product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Best practices suggest that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 90 percent</NUMEX> of the
drawings for a product's design be completed before a decision to
commit additional resources is made. Likewise, later knowledge that
the design can be manufactured <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">affordably</ENAMEX> and with consistent high
quality prior to making a production decision ensures that cost and
schedule <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> will be met. This knowledge comes in the form of
evidence from data that shows manufacturing processes are in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and system reliability is achievable. Leading commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> rely on knowledge obtained about critical manufacturing
processes and product reliability to make their production
decisions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> (DOD) programs we reviewed captured
varying amounts of design and manufacturing knowledge in the form
of completed engineering drawings and statistical process control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. We found a correlation between the amount of knowledge each
captured and their cost and schedule outcomes. Programs that were
able to complete more engineering drawings and control their
critical manufacturing processes had more success in meeting cost
and schedule targets established when they began.
Conceptually, the product development process has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phases: a
system integration phase to stabilize the product's design and a
system demonstration phase to demonstrate the product can be
manufactured affordably and work reliably. The system integration
phase is used to stabilize the overall system design by integrating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> and subsystems into a product and by showing that the
design can meet product requirements. When this knowledge is
captured, knowledge point 2 has been achieved. It should be
demonstrated by the completion of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 90 percent</NUMEX> of
engineering drawings, which both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> and leading commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> consider to be the point when a product's design is
essentially complete. In the DOD process, this knowledge point
should happen by the critical design review, before system
demonstration and the initial manufacturing of production
representative products begins. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration phase is
then used to demonstrate that the product will work as required and
can be manufactured within targets. When this knowledge is
captured, knowledge point 3 has been achieved. Critical
manufacturing processes are in control and consistently producing
items within quality standards and tolerances for the overall
product. Also, product reliability has been demonstrated. In the
DOD process, like with the commercial process, this knowledge point
should happen by the production commitment milestone. Bypassing
critical knowledge at either knowledge point will usually result in
cost, schedule, and performance problems later in product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and production.
We found that the most successful programs had taken steps to
gather knowledge that confirmed the product's design was stable
before the design was released to manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to
build products for demonstration. They had most of the detailed
design complete, supported by the completion of a large percentage
of engineering drawings to manufacturing. Again, engineering
drawings are critical because they include details on the parts and
work instructions needed to make the product and reflect the
results of testing. These drawings allowed manufacturing personnel
to effectively plan the fabrication process and efficiently build
production representative prototypes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> so
manufacturing processes and the product's performance could be
validated before committing to production. The most successful DOD
programs also captured the knowledge that manufacturing processes
needed to build the product would consistently produce a reliable
product by the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration, before making a
production decision. On these programs, the initial phase of
production-sometimes known as low-rate initial production-was able
to focus on building operational test articles and improving the
production processes, instead of continuing the product's design
and development.
Problematic programs moved forward into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration
without the same knowledge from engineering drawings that
successful cases had captured. They increased investments in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tooling</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and materials before the design was stable. In
these programs, only a small percentage of the drawings needed to
make the products had been completed at the time the designs were
released to manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> for building production
representative prototypes. In doing so, these programs undertook
the difficult challenge of stabilizing the designs at the same time
they were trying to build and test the products. This design
immaturity caused costly design changes and parts shortages that,
in turn, caused labor inefficiencies, schedule delays, and quality
problems. Consequently, these programs required significant
increases in resources--time and money-over what was estimated at
the point each program began the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration phase.
The most problematic programs also started production before
design and manufacturing development work was concluded. In these
cases, programs were producing items for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> while making
major product design and tooling changes, still establishing
manufacturing processes, and conducting development testing. These
programs encountered significant cost increases, schedule delays,
and performance problems during production.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> shows the relationship between design stability and
manufacturing knowledge at key junctures and the outcomes for the
DOD programs we reviewed. To measure design stability at the start
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration phase, knowledge point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, we determined
the percentage of the product's engineering drawings that had been
completed by the critical design review. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> programs, after the
critical design review, the system design is released to
manufacturing to begin building the production representative
prototypes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration phase. To measure
producibility at the production decision, knowledge point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, we
determined whether the critical manufacturing processes were in
statistical control at that time. We compared this information with
best practices. The cost and schedule experiences of the program
since the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration are also shown.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attainment of Design and Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX> in DOD
Programs and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Program Outcomes</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">aWhile AIM-9X</ENAMEX> used statistical process control on a limited
basis, we believe other factors contributed to a successful
production outcome to date. Other factors included early
achievement of design stability, early identification of key
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and critical manufacturing processes, use of
established manufacturing processes for components common to other
weapon systems, design trade-offs to enhance manufacturing
capability, and a product design less vulnerable to variations in
manufacturing processes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bF/A-18 E/F</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 percent</NUMEX> of drawings completed but also had
completed most of the higher-level assembly drawings. The
combination of these drawings with the fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was a
variant of previously fielded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-18</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft models</ENAMEX> provided the
program a significant amount of knowledge that the design was

Reports.
As shown in the table, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FA-18 E/F</ENAMEX> programs had
captured a significant amount of design knowledge at the start of
system demonstration and manufacturing knowledge by the start of
production. In each of those programs, product <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> had the
advantage of prior versions of the systems. These programs came
very close to meeting their original cost and schedule estimates
for product development. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX>, had less knowledge at each key junctures. Their
development cost and schedule results significantly exceeded
estimates. Specific details on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9X</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX>
program experiences follow.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-9X Program Experience
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> program began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, continuing the long-term
evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM-9</ENAMEX> series of short-range air-to-air <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, after developing and testing a number of engineering
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">prototype</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>, the program held a critical design review to
determine if the program was ready to begin initial manufacturing
of a production representative prototype for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration.
At this review, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 95 percent</NUMEX> of the eventual engineering
drawings were completed-a stable design by best practices. Because
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-9X</ENAMEX> was the next generation in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>, the
program had significant knowledge on how to produce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>. At
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> critical design review, the estimated development and
production costs totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.82 billion</NUMEX>. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX>, the
estimate was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.96 billion</NUMEX>, less than a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> increase.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22 Program Experience The F-22</ENAMEX> program
began detailed design efforts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> when it entered a planned
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8-year</TIMEX> product development phase. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, about the expected
midpoint of the phase, the program held its critical design review
to determine if the design was stable and complete. Despite having
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a quarter</NUMEX> of the eventual design drawings completed for
the system, the program declared the design to be stable and ready
to begin initial manufacturing. At that time, the program office
had estimated the cost to complete the development program at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19.5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX>. However, the program did not complete <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of its
drawings for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998, 3 years</TIMEX> into the system
demonstration phase. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>,
several design and manufacturing problems surfaced that affected
the deliveries of major sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. Large sections
were delivered incomplete to final assembly and had to be built out
of the planned assembly sequence.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review team</ENAMEX> examined the program and
determined the product development effort was underestimated. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> found that building the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was taking
substantially <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more labor hours</TIMEX> than planned. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1995 and 1998</TIMEX>,
the development estimate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> increased by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $3.3</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX> and the schedule slipped by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. Achieving design
stability late has contributed to further cost increases. As of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX>, the estimated development cost was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$26.1 billion</NUMEX>, a
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34 percent</NUMEX> increase since the critical design review was held in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> attributes some production cost increases to a
reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> quantities, it has been significantly affected by
design and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX> Program Experience
manufacturing problems that started during development. The
independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review team</ENAMEX> evaluated the cost impact on the production
aircraft that would likely occur because of cost and schedule
problems in development and found that production <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> would
have to begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, at a slower pace, and cost more than expected.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> estimated that production costs could increase by as much
as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13 billion</NUMEX> if savings were not found. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
subsequently increased the estimate to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $19 billion</NUMEX> in
cost savings required to avoid cost increases. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, when the
F-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> limited production decision was made, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> had less
knowledge about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s reliability and manufacturing
processes than more successful cases. For example, at its limited
production decision, it had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 44 percent</NUMEX> of its critical
manufacturing processes in control. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2001</TIMEX>, the program
reported that overall production cost would likely increase by more
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.4 billion</NUMEX>. This estimate was based on the effort needed so
far to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> during product development.
Since it began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX> program has had
significant cost growth and schedule delays during product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. The product <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> held a major design review in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX>, the review demanded less proof about the
product's design in the form of engineering drawings before
deciding to begin initial manufacturing. At that time, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 21</NUMEX>
percent of the engineering drawings had been completed, and it was
still unknown whether the design would meet the requirements. In
fact, the program knew that a major redesign of a critical
component was needed. Despite this, the program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> deemed the
risk acceptable for moving the program forward to begin
manufacturing prototypes. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 2 years</TIMEX>, the program
encountered numerous design and manufacturing problems. It was not
until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 2 years</TIMEX> after the critical design review, that
program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> felt that the design had stabilized; however, by
this time, the product development cost had increased <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">160 percent</NUMEX>
and production had been delayed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 3 years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX> is scheduled to begin limited production in early
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, but without the same degree of assurance as the more
successful programs that the product can be manufactured within
cost, schedule, and quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. The program has not yet
determined if manufacturing processes needed to build the product
are in control. Many of the development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were built by hand,
in different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and with different processes and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> stated that because they did not
stabilize the design until late in development, manufacturing
issues were not adequately addressed. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the estimated
unit cost for the system has increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">182 percent</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chapter 3</ENAMEX>
Best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Practices Enable Timely Capture of Design and Manufacturing</ENAMEX>
Knowledge
Leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have been successful in achieving
product development goals because they have found ways to enable
the capture of design and manufacturing knowledge about the
products they are developing in a timely way. We found two
practices that allowed leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to capture
necessary knowledge for product development. First, they
established a framework of evolutionary product development that
limited the amount of design and manufacturing knowledge that had
to be captured. This framework limited the design challenge for any
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new product development by requiring risky technology, design,
or manufacturing requirements to be deferred until a future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of the product. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) employed a
disciplined product development process that brought together and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> all of the technologies, components, and subsystems
required for the product to ensure the design was stable before
entering product demonstration and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) demonstrated the product was
reliable and producible using proven manufacturing processes before
entering production.
The product development process includes tools that both capture
knowledge and tie this knowledge to decisions about the product's
design and manufacturing processes before making commitments that
would significantly affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> resources. For example, during
system integration, each leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> used various
forms of prototypes and information from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> products to
stabilize the product's design and identify critical processes,
then used a decision review that required agreements from key
stakeholders that the requisite design knowledge was captured in
making a decision to move into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration. During system
demonstration, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> used statistical process control and
reliability testing to ensure the product could be produced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affordably</ENAMEX> and would be reliable, then used a similar decision
review that required agreements from key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> that the
requisite knowledge was captured when deciding to move into
production.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> (DOD) programs that we reviewed used
some of these practices to varying degrees and experienced
predictable outcomes. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18 E/F</ENAMEX>
programs were evolutionary in nature, modifications of existing
products with a manageable amount of new technological or design
challenges. They also gathered design and manufacturing knowledge,
although not to the extent we found at commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
Finally, they held program reviews and ensured that the design and
manufacturing knowledge was captured before moving forward. They
had relatively successful outcomes. The other DOD

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evolutionary Product Development</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reduce Development</ENAMEX>
Risks
programs-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCMS</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-did not closely
approximate best practices in capturing design or manufacturing
knowledge during product development. They took on greater design
challenges, had program reviews that were not supported by critical
design and manufacturing knowledge, and made decisions to advance
to the next phases of development without sufficient design and
manufacturing knowledge.
A key to the success of commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> was using an
evolutionary approach to develop a product. This approach permitted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to focus more on design and development with a limited
array of new content and technologies in a program. It also ensured
that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had the requisite knowledge for a product's
design before investing in the development of manufacturing
processes and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX> have found that trying to
capture the knowledge required to stabilize the design of a product
that requires significant amounts of new content is an unmanageable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX>, especially if the goal is to reduce cycle times and get the
product into the marketplace as quickly as possible. Design
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> not achievable in the initial development were planned for
subsequent development efforts in future generations of the
product, but only when technologies were proven to be mature and
other resources were available.
Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have implemented the evolutionary approach
by establishing time-phased plans to develop new products in
increments based on technologies and resources achievable now and
later. This approach reduces the amount of risk in the development
of each increment, facilitating greater success in meeting cost,
schedule, and performance requirements. In effect, these companies
evolve products, continuously improving their performance as new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> and methods allow. These evolutionary improvements to
products eventually result in the full desired capability, but in
multiple steps, delivering a series of enhanced interim
capabilities to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> more quickly.
Historically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s approach has been to develop new weapon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> that often attempt to satisfy the full requirement in a
single step, regardless of the design challenge or the maturity of
technologies necessary to achieve the full capability. Under this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">single-step</ENAMEX> approach, a war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX> can wait over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX> to
receive any improved capability. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> shows a notional
comparison between the single-step and evolutionary approaches.

engineering development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> considers the
introduction of immature technologies into fielded products or new

introductions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins and Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> indicated
that, in the past, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> learned the hard way by trying
to make quantum leaps in product performance and by including
immature technologies. Now, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have new product
development processes that actively manage the amount of new
content that can be placed on a new product development effort.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> also limits new content on its new products as a way to
more successfully and cost-effectively develop new, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evolutionary</ENAMEX>, products. Even during the development of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">797</NUMEX>
mining truck, which it considered a major design challenge, it did
not require the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> to achieve capabilities-such as prognostics
for better maintenance-that it could not demonstrate or validate in
the design in a timely manner.
Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> DOD programs we reviewed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-the F/A-18-E/F</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9X</NUMEX>-were variations of existing products-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18</ENAMEX>-C/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9M</NUMEX>-and the programs made a commitment to use existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> and processes as much as possible. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> programs
had relatively successful cost and schedule outcomes. They
represented an exception to the usual practice in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>. The
overwhelming majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s major acquisitions today require
major leaps in capability over their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX> or any other
competing weapon systems, with little knowledge about the resources
that will be required to design and manufacture the systems.
Decisions are continually made throughout product development
without knowing the cost and schedule ramifications.
Leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we visited had spent significant
amounts of time and resources to develop and evolve new product
development processes that ensured design and manufacturing
knowledge was captured at the two critical decision points in
product development: when the product's design was demonstrated to
be stable-knowledge point <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-and</TIMEX> when the product was demonstrated
to be producible at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an affordable</NUMEX> cost-knowledge point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The
process established a disciplined framework to capture specific
design and manufacturing knowledge about new products. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX>
then used that knowledge to make informed decisions about moving
forward in a new product development program. Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
tied this knowledge to decisions about the products' design and
manufacturing processes before making commitments that would
significantly impact company resources. Each commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> we
visited had a new product development process that was prominent
and central to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>'s successes. It included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Design Knowledge Should Be Captured</ENAMEX> before
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entering Product Demonstration</ENAMEX>
aspects: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) activities that led to the capture of specific
design knowledge,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) activities that led to the capture of specific manufacturing
and product reliability knowledge, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) decision reviews to
determine if the appropriate knowledge was captured to move to the
next phase.
To ensure that the product's design was stable before deciding
to commit additional resources to product demonstration, commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> demanded knowledge, either from existing product
information or by building engineering prototypes. They also used a
disciplined design review process to examine and verify the
knowledge that had culminated at the end of product integration,
This design review process required agreement from stakeholders
that the product design could be produced and would satisfy the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>'s requirements. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stakeholders</ENAMEX> included design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>,
manufacturing or production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">supplier</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> who used engineering drawings, supported by test
results and engineering data, as a key indicator of the design's
stability. Once the program achieved a stable design, the certainty
of their cost and schedule estimates was substantially increased,
allowing them to plan the balance of the product development
program with high confidence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> shows the activities required
to capture design knowledge that leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> decisions about
whether to transition to the next phase of development.

Decisions

Activities to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achieve Stable Design Knowledge</ENAMEX>


•
Limit design challenge - The initial design challenge is
limited to a product that can be developed and delivered quickly
and provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> with an improved capability. A time-phased
plan is used to develop improved products-future generations-in
increments as technologies and other resources become
available.


•
Demonstrate design meets requirements -The product's
design is demonstrated to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s requirements. For a new
product that is not based on an existing product, prototypes are
built and tested. If the product is a variant of an existing
product, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> often used modeling and simulation or prototypes
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> or subsystem level to demonstrate the new
product's design.


•
Complete critical design reviews - Critical design
reviews are used to assess whether a product's design meets
requirements and is ready to start initial manufacturing. They are
conducted for the system, subsystems, and components to assess
design maturity and technical risk.


•
Stakeholders agree drawings complete and producible - The
agreement by stakeholders (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>) is used to signify confidence that the design will
work and the product can be built.


•
Executive level review to begin initial manufacturing -
Corporate stakeholders meet and review relevant product knowledge,
including design stability, to determine whether a product is ready
to initiate manufacturing of production representative prototypes
used during system demonstrations. The decision is tied to the
capture of knowledge.


Demonstrating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design Helped Achieve</ENAMEX>
Stability
A key tool used by each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to ensure that a product's
design was stable by the end of the product integration phase was a
demonstration that the design would meet requirements. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> visited indicated that prototypes at various system
levels were the best way to demonstrate that the product's design
would work. If the product under development was an incremental
improvement to existing products, such as the next generation of a
printer or engine, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> used virtual prototypes for any
components that were being used for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time. If the product
included more new content or invention, fully integrated prototypes
were frequently used to demonstrate that the design met
requirements. Prototypes at this stage in development were
typically not built in a manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. This allowed
demonstrations of the design before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> made more costly
investments in manufacturing equipment and tooling to build
production representative prototypes for the demonstration phase.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX> shows an example of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and purposes for various
kinds of prototypes used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins Inc.</ENAMEX> depending on the amount of
knowledge it needed to capture and the point it was in the
development process. Prototypes were used by commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
throughout the product development process and not just during
product integration.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">horsepower</ENAMEX>, effectively uses prototypes to ensure that a design is
stable and believes in the value of prototyping throughout product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> stated that not using
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prototypes</ENAMEX> becomes a matter of "pay me now or pay me later,"
meaning that it is far less costly to demonstrate a product's
design early in development with prototypes, concepts, and analyses
than to incur the cost of significant design changes after a
product has entered production-a much more costly environment to
make changes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> built and tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> engineering concept

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disciplined Reviews</ENAMEX> and Stakeholder
Agreements Supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capture of Design Knowledge</ENAMEX>
overhead cam diesel engine that represented a quantum leap in
performance beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX>' existing products. These prototypes
were built using production-like tooling and methods using
production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. In addition to using engineering prototypes
during the product integration phase of product development,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we visited used other prototypes-such
as production representative prototypes-in the remaining product
development phases before production, as shown in table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>, to
demonstrate product reliability and process control. Prior to
reaching production for its Signature 600 engine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> used many
prototypes to complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of test <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>,
accumulating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of test miles.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> of heavy equipment, has a
continuous product improvement philosophy. That is, it tries to
develop new products that increase the capabilities of existing
product lines, but it limits the amount of new content on any one
product development because new content inherently increases design
risk. In evolving its products this way, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> is able to use
modeling and simulation prior to initial manufacturing because it
has existing products to provide a baseline of knowledge and a good
benchmark for assessing the simulated performance. In addition,
with knowledge of existing components, it can focus attention on
maturing the new content, the higher risk element of the new
product. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> developed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">797</NUMEX> mining <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>, a new
360ton payload truck design, it demonstrated design stability by
identifying the critical components and building engineering
prototypes of them for reliability testing and demonstration of the
design before beginning initial manufacturing. This knowledge,
coupled with vast experience in manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>, ensured the
stability of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">797</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> design before initial manufacturing
started. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> was able to deliver this design in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX>
after the product development was started.
The commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we visited understood the importance of
having disciplined design reviews and getting agreement from the
stakeholders that the product's design had been demonstrated to
meet requirements before beginning initial manufacturing. Each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had a design review process that began at the component
level, continued through the subsystem level, and culminated with a
critical design review of the integrated system to determine if the
product was ready to progress to the next phase of development. In
addition to design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>, a crossfunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in the process included key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, manufacturing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, and service and maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>. From
past experience, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have
Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Level Reviews Were Required to</ENAMEX>
Begin Initial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturing</ENAMEX>
discovered that cross-functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> provide a complete
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> of the product. While design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> bring important
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and experience to creating a product design, they may not be
aware of manufacturing issues, available technologies, or
manufacturing processes, and they may design a product that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> cannot afford to produce or maintain.
The product's design is stable when all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> agree that
engineering drawings are complete and that the design will work and
can be built. A commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> considers engineering drawings4
to be a good measure of the demonstrated stability of the product's
design because they represent the language used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> to
communicate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> the details of a new product
design-what it looks like, how its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components interface</ENAMEX>, how it
functions, how to build it, and what critical materials and
processes are required to fabricate and test it. The engineering
drawing package released to manufacturing includes items such as
the schematic of the product's components, interface control
documents, a listing of materials, notations of critical
manufacturing processes, and testing requirements. It is this
package that allows a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> to build the product in the
manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.
In developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Signature 600</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> used cross-functional
design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that included stakeholders from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, machine
tool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>, foundry and pattern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, purchasing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX>, manufacturing engineering, design engineering, and other
technical disciplines. Signature <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> components were designed with
the key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> co-located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> design <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.
Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> said that early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> and manufacturing
involvement was critical to success and that engineering drawings
were signed by design and manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> said that signing the drawings was a certification
that the design could be manufactured <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>, if
necessary.
Each commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, after capturing specific design
knowledge, had an executive level review at the decision point to
determine if the product design had sufficiently progressed to
permit a transition from product integration to product
demonstration. This decision point used the knowledge captured as
exit criteria for moving to the next phase of development. For
example, to demonstrate the product design was stable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4 Engineering</ENAMEX> drawings can include the standard two-dimensional
drawings or newer threedimensional drawings that are the product of
computer-aided design software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturing and Product</ENAMEX> Reliability
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Knowledge Should Be Captured before Starting Production</ENAMEX>
and ready to move from integration to demonstration, the design
had to be demonstrated, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 90 percent</NUMEX> of the engineering
drawings had to be completed, design reviews had to be completed,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> had to agree the design was complete and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">producible</ENAMEX>. If the design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> could not satisfy the exit criteria,
then other options had to be considered. Options included canceling
the development program, delaying the decision until all criteria
were met, or moving ahead with a detailed plan to achieve criteria
not met by a specific time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> would revisit the other
options. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> emphasized that if a major milestone is
delayed, an appropriate adjustment should be made to the end date
of the program, thereby avoiding compressing the time allotted for
the rest of product development and managing the risks that
subsequent milestones will be missed.
This decision point coincides with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' need to
increase investments in the product development and continue to the
next phase. For this reason, the decision point was considered
critical to achieving success in product development and could not
be taken lightly. For example, transitioning from the integration
to the demonstration phase requires a significant investment to
start building and testing production representative prototypes in
a manufacturing environment. This requires establishing a supplier
base and purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>. In addition, establishing tooling
and manufacturing capability is also required. After a product
passes this decision point and added investments are made, the cost
of making changes to the product design also increases
significantly. Therefore, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> strive to firm the
design as early in the process as possible when it is significantly
cheaper to make changes.
We found that leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tools to
capture knowledge that a product's design was reliable and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">producible</ENAMEX> within cost, schedule, and quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> before making
a production decision. These tools are (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a quality concept that
uses statistical process control to bring critical manufacturing
processes under control so they are repeatable, sustainable, and
consistently producing parts within the quality tolerances and
standards of the product and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) product tests in operational
conditions that ensure the system would meet reliability goals-the
ability to work without failure or need of maintenance for
predictable intervals. Company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us that these two
tools enabled a smooth transition from product development to
production, resulting in better program outcomes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX>
employed these tools on production representative prototypes,
making the prototypes a key <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> to successful outcomes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX> shows the activities required to capture manufacturing
knowledge that leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> decisions about whether to
transition from product development into production.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Activities to Capture Manufacturing Knowledge and Make</ENAMEX>
Decisions

Activities to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achieve Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX>


•
Identify key system characteristics and critical
manufacturing processes - Key product characteristics and critical
manufacturing processes are identified. Because there can be
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of manufacturing processes required to build a product,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> focus on the critical processes-those that build parts
that influence the product's key characteristics such as
performance, service life, or manufacturability.


•
Determine processes in control and capable - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX>
process control is used to determine if the processes are
consistently producing parts. Once control is established, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> is made to measure the process's ability to build a part
within specification limits as well as how close the part is to
that specification. A process is considered capable when it has a
defect rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1</NUMEX> out of every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,152</NUMEX> parts
produced.


•
Conduct failure modes and effects analysis - Bottom-up
analysis is done to identify potential failures for product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX>. It begins at the lowest level of the product design
and continues to each higher tier of the product until the entire
product has been analyzed. It allows early design changes to
correct potential problems before fabricating hardware.


•
Set reliability growth plan and goals - A product's
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX> is its ability to perform over an expected period of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> without failure, degradation, or need of repair. A growth plan
is developed to mature the product's reliability over time through
reliability growth testing so that it has been demonstrated by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> production begins.


•
Conduct reliability growth testing -Reliability growth is
the result of an iterative design, build, test, analyze, and fix
process for a product's design with the aim of improving the
product's reliability over time. Design flaws are uncovered and the
design of the product is matured.


•
Conduct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> level review to begin production -
Corporate stakeholders meet and review relevant product knowledge,
including manufacturing and reliability knowledge, to determine
whether a product is ready to begin production. The decision is
tied to the capture of knowledge.



or manufacturability. Therefore, when design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> are
designing the new product, they must identify its key
characteristics so that manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> can identify and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> critical manufacturing processes. Key product
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and critical manufacturing processes are noted on
the engineering drawings and work instructions that are released to
manufacturing.
Once critical processes are identified, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> perform
capability studies to ensure that a process will produce parts that
meet specifications. These studies yield a process capability index
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX>), a measure of the process's ability to build a part within
specified limits. The index can be translated into an expected
product defect rate. The industry standard is to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.33</NUMEX>
or higher, which equates to a probability that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.99 percent</NUMEX> of the
parts built on that process will be within the specified limits.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">five5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we visited wanted their critical
processes at a minimum of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> and many had goals of
achieving higher <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cpks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX> shows various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> values and the
defect rate associated with each value. The table also shows the
higher the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX>, the lower the defect rate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>: Cpk Index and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Probability of a Defective Part</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> values also have an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> effect on various individual
parts when each part is integrated into the final product. For
example, a product composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> parts, where each part is
produced on a manufacturing process with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.67</NUMEX>, has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95.5</NUMEX>
percent probability that each part will be defect free. However,
when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 25</NUMEX> parts are assembled into the final product, the
probability that the final product will be defect free is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 32</NUMEX>
percent. In comparison, if the same parts are produced with
manufacturing processes at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.33</NUMEX>, the probability of each
part being defect free is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.99 percent</NUMEX>. When these same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> parts
are assembled into the final product, the probability that the
final product will be defect free is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> wanted its critical manufacturing processes
at a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.8 percent</NUMEX>. This comparison illustrates the impact that having
manufacturing processes in control has on the amount of rework and
repair that would be needed to correct defects and make the product
meet its specifications.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> uses statistical process control data to measure a
product's readiness for production. In developing the new Signature
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> diesel engine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> included manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> and
machine tool and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fixture suppliers</ENAMEX> in the design decision process
as the engine concept was first being defined. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> built
production representative prototypes of its engines to demonstrate
that the design and the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hardware</ENAMEX> would perform to
requirements. These prototypes represented the first attempt to
build the product solely using manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, production
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tooling</ENAMEX>, and production processes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> used the knowledge
captured from these and subsequent prototypes to refine and
eventually validate the manufacturing processes for the engine.
This process of employing statistical process control techniques on
prototype engines verified that the manufacturing processes were
capable of manufacturing the product to high quality standards
within established cost and schedule targets.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we visited emphasized the importance of
controlling manufacturing processes before committing to
production. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> captures knowledge about the
producibility of its product early in the design phase. By
production, it strives to have all critical manufacturing processes
for the product-including key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>' processes-in control with
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1.33</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> achieves this by building
production representative prototypes and by requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> of
key components and subassemblies to produce an adequate sample of
parts to demonstrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>' processes can be controlled,
usually before the parts are incorporated into the prototypes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Aircraft Engines</ENAMEX> has digitally captured, and made
available to design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> data on almost all of its
manufacturing processes and it strives to have critical processes
in control to a point where they will yield <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 1</NUMEX> defect
in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 million</NUMEX> parts, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cpk</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX>, told us that getting manufacturing
processes in control prior to production is key to meeting cost,
schedule, and quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> visited used
this as an indicator of the product's readiness for production and
emphasized the importance of having critical manufacturing
processes under control by the start of production.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demonstrating Product Reliability Indicates</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Product Is Ready for Production</ENAMEX>
A product is reliable when it can perform over a specified
period of time without failure, degradation, or need of repair.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliability</ENAMEX> is a function of the specific elements of a product's
design. Making design changes to achieve reliability requirements
after production begins is inefficient and costly. Reliability
growth testing provides visibility over how reliability is
improving and uncovers design problems so fixes can be incorporated
before production begins.
In general, reliability growth is the result of an iterative
design, build, test, analyze, and fix process. Prototype hardware
is key to testing for reliability growth. Initial prototypes for a
complex product with major technological advances have inherent
deficiencies. As the prototypes are tested, failures occur and, in
fact, are desired so that the product's design can be made more
reliable. Reliability improves over time with design changes or
manufacturing process improvements. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this</TIMEX> takes place,
the less impact it will have on the development and production
program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX> we visited matured a product's reliability
through these tests and demanded proof that the product would meet
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>'s reliability expectations prior to making a
production decision.
Improvements in the reliability of a product's design can be
measured by tracking a key reliability metric over time. This
metric compares the product's actual reliability to a growth plan
and ultimately to the overall reliability goal. Several commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we visited began gathering this data very early in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and tracked it throughout development. The goal was to
demonstrate the product would meet reliability requirements before
starting full rate production.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> establishes a plan to grow and demonstrate the
product's reliability before fabrication of a production
representative prototype begins. Before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> starts making
parts, it estimates the product's reliability in its current stage
of development based on knowledge captured from failure modes and
effects analysis<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,6</NUMEX> component prototype testing, and past product
experience. This information marks the starting point for the
product's reliability growth plan and is the basis for assessing
whether the plan is achievable by production. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX>
believes the risks are too
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> Failure modes and effects analysis is a bottom-up approach to
failure identification. It should begin at the lowest level of the
product design. Through analysis potential failure modes are
identified allowing early design change to correct potential
problems before fabricating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hardware</ENAMEX>-a more cost-effective time to
identify and fix problems.

high and the goal cannot be achieved on time, decision makers
assess trade-offs between new and existing components to reduce the
risks to a more manageable level. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trade-offs</ENAMEX> might be made if the
product's performance still fails to meet requirements. If
trade-offs are not possible, decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> may decide not to go
forward with the development. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> has established this
plan, it tracks demonstrated reliability against it as a management
tool to measure progress. It sets an interim reliability milestone
and expects to be at least halfway toward the expected goal by the
time it begins to build production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> has learned
from experience that it will achieve the full reliability goal by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> production if it meets the interim goal by the time it
produces pilot production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. If the reliability is not growing
as expected, then decisions about changing or improving the design
must be addressed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> improves the product's reliability during
development by testing prototypes, uncovering failures, and
incorporating design changes. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>,
the production decision will be delayed if they are not on track to
meeting their reliability goal. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> maintains the philosophy of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> getting the design
right, then producing it as quickly and efficiently as possible.
They emphasized that demonstrating reliability before production
minimized the potential for costly design changes once the product
is fielded.
The commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, after capturing specific manufacturing
knowledge, had executive level reviews to determine if the product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> had sufficiently progressed to permit a transition into
production. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX> used the knowledge captured as exit criteria
for the transition. For example, to demonstrate the product was
ready for production, critical processes had to be in control and
testing should have demonstrated the product reliability. If the
design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> could not satisfy the exit criteria, then other options
had to be considered. The production decision led to increased
investments for materials and resources such as additional tooling
to build the product at a planned rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
training and support.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">DOD Programs More Closely</ENAMEX> Approximated
Best <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Practices, Outcomes Were Better</ENAMEX>
Our analysis of DOD programs showed that those more closely
approximating best practices had better outcomes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18 E/F</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fighter</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> were based extensively on
predecessor programs and employed similar tools to capture design
and manufacturing knowledge at critical program junctures. These
programs had demonstrated a significantly higher degree of design
stability prior to entering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration and committing to
initial manufacturing when compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">DOD weapon</ENAMEX> programs in
our review. They also gained control of most of their manufacturing
processes and demonstrated that the products were reliable before
entering production. The success of these programs is best
demonstrated by the fact that they have been close to meeting cost,
schedule, and performance objectives. On the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-3
missile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> did not use these
best practices. These programs were not based on predecessor
products or evolutionary in nature, and each product's full
capability was expected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step, with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> product off the
production line. With this daunting task, these programs failed to
demonstrate a stable design before committing to initial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturing</ENAMEX>, causing quality and labor problems. These programs
also had much less knowledge about the manufacturability of their
design when they entered production. As a result, they experienced
significant increases in development costs and production delays
usually at the expense of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> programs. Details on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
DOD programs follow.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-9X Missile</ENAMEX> Program The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-9X
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> practices closely paralleled best practices used by the
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we visited. The program achieved design
stability before moving into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration by incorporating
mature technologies and components from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> and
munitions, using engineering prototypes to demonstrate the design,
holding a series of design reviews prior to the system level
critical design review, and completing and releasing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> of
the engineering drawings at that time. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> shows the building
of knowledge required to achieve a stable design on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9X</NUMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> program made extensive use of engineering prototypes
to stabilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>'s design before building production
representative prototypes. Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> stated that testing of
engineering prototypes uncovered problems with missile design and
manufacturing tooling early in the development, during system
integration, allowing time to re-design and re-test in follow-on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configurations</ENAMEX>. According to program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, this not only
helped stabilize the design before entering initial manufacturing
but grew system reliability and reduced total ownership costs. The
program also held design reviews for each of the major subsystems,
allowing the program to achieve and demonstrate a stable design in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999</TIMEX>, before beginning initial manufacturing of production
representative prototypes.
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9X</NUMEX> used statistical process control only to a
limited extent, other factors have allowed it to have a more
successful production outcome to date. Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> took steps
to ensure that manufacturing aspects of the product were included
in the design, including empowering a product <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> with a
manufacturing background, identifying the key characteristics and
critical manufacturing processes early, making design trade-offs to
enhance manufacturing capability, and demonstrating a robust design
to make the product less vulnerable to variations in manufacturing
process. In addition, the ability to achieve design stability at
the critical design review allowed program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to focus the
system demonstration phase on maturing the manufacturing processes.
Prior to committing to production, the program demonstrated that
the product could be efficiently
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18 E/F</ENAMEX> Program
built using production processes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, tools, and facilities
to build prototypes. According to the former program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, these
steps gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> knowledge that a reliable product could be
produced within cost and schedule targets prior to entering
production. To date, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AIM-9X</ENAMEX> program has largely met its
production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18 E/F</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> development program was able to take
advantage of knowledge captured in developing and manufacturing
prior versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. This evolutionary approach
significantly contributed to the cost and schedule successes of
this program. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18 E/F</ENAMEX> was a variant of the older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> had prior knowledge of design and
manufacturing problems. This knowledge, coupled with the use of
modeling and computer-aided design software, helped create a design
that was easier to manufacture. While the program did not fully use
each of the best practices, it did embrace the concepts of
capturing design and manufacturing knowledge early in the
program.
During the program's critical design review, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 56 percent</NUMEX> of
the drawings were completed and, while the program did not meet the
best practice of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> complete, it did have additional
drawing data of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18 E/F</ENAMEX> assemblies available for review at
the critical design review. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> used early versions of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to demonstrate new component designs and new
materials. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was designed to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
percent fewer parts than its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX>, making its design more
robust. The program also identified the critical manufacturing
processes and collected statistical process control data early in
product development. At the start of production, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78 percent</NUMEX> of
these critical processes were in control. Unit costs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F/A-18</ENAMEX>
E<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/F</ENAMEX> program have not grown since the critical design review and its
schedule has been delayed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 3 months</TIMEX>.
F-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fighter Program</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> program is structured to provide the product's full
capability with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> product off the production line-an
extreme design challenge. This required the product design to
include many new and unproven technologies, designs, and
manufacturing processes. It did not demonstrate design stability
until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 3 years</TIMEX> after it held its critical design review. The
program completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,070</NUMEX> initial engineering drawings at its
critical design review in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 26 percent</NUMEX> of the eventual
drawings needed. It did not complete <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of the necessary
engineering drawings until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> development
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX> were delivered. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> shows the drawing completion
history for the program.

After its critical design review, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> program encountered
several design and manufacturing problems that resulted in design
changes, labor inefficiencies, cost increases, and schedule delays.
For example, delivery of the aft fuselage-the rear aircraft body
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section-</ENAMEX>was late for several of the test <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ground
test articles because of late parts and difficulties with the
welding process. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, design
maturity and manufacturing problems caused a "rolling wave" effect
throughout system integration and final assembly. Late engineering
drawing releases to the factory floor resulted in parts shortages
and work performed out of sequence. These events contributed to
significant cost overruns and delays to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> deliveries to the
flight test program.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> program initially had taken steps to use statistical
process control data during development and gain control of
critical manufacturing processes by the full rate production
decision. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1998,7</NUMEX> we reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> had identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">926</NUMEX>
critical manufacturing processes and had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 40 percent</NUMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 years</TIMEX> before production was scheduled to begin. Although
this did not match the standard set by commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, it
offered major improvements over what other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> programs had
attempted or achieved. Unfortunately, citing budgetary constraints
and specific hardware quality problems that demanded attention, the
program abandoned this best practices approach in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> with less
than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of it critical manufacturing processes in control.
Currently, the program is using post-assembly inspection to
identify and fix defects rather than statistical process control
techniques to prevent them. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> 2002,8 we recommended that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> monitor the status of critical manufacturing
processes as the program proceeds toward high rate production. The
program stated that it would assess the processes status as the
program moves forward.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> entered limited production despite being
substantially behind its plan to achieve reliability goals. A key
reliability requirement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> is mean time between
maintenance, defined as the number of operating <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> for the
aircraft divided by the number of maintenance actions. The
reliability goal for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-hour</TIMEX> mean time between
maintenance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> estimated that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2001</TIMEX>, when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> entered limited production, it should have been able to
demonstrate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 2</NUMEX> flying <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> between maintenance actions.
However, when it actually began limited production it could only
fly an average of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.44 hours</TIMEX> between maintenance actions. In other
words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX> is requiring significantly more maintenance actions
than planned. Additionally, the program has been slow to fix and
correct problems that have affected reliability. To date, the
program has identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 260</NUMEX> different types of failures, such
as main landing gear tires wearing out more quickly than planned,
fasteners being damaged, and canopy delaminating. It has identified
fixes for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50 percent</NUMEX> of these failures. Ideally, the
design fixes for the failures should be corrected prior to
manufacturing production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-3 Missile Program The PAC-3</ENAMEX> missile did
not achieve design stability until after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of production
representative prototypes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration began. At the
program's critical design review, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> program had completed
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">980</NUMEX> engineering drawings-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21 percent</NUMEX> of the eventual drawings needed
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>. Since then, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 3,700</NUMEX> more drawings have been
completed. The total number of drawings expected to represent the
completed design grew from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,900</NUMEX> at the critical design
review to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 4,700</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as of July 2001</TIMEX>. This uncertainty in the
expected drawings not only indicates that the design was not stable
when initial manufacturing began but also shows that there was a
significant lack of knowledge about the design. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> shows the
design knowledge at the critical design review, when the decision
was made to commit to initial manufacturing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>.

Prototypes of the product design were not built before the
critical design review or before initial manufacturing started to
show that the design would work. Therefore, because of the immature
design, initially manufactured development <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> were hand-made,
took longer to build than planned, and suffered from poor quality.
As a result, many design and manufacturing problems surfaced during
system demonstration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subsystems</ENAMEX> did not fit together properly, and
many failed ground and environmental tests the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> attributed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> of additional cost to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
manufacturing problems.
Prior to entering limited production in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> had
less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of the critical manufacturing processes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for assembling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> and the seeker. According to
program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, there was little emphasis during development or
initial production on using statistical control on critical
manufacturing processes. Most of the development <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> were
built in specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> rather than in a manufacturing
environment. The result was a lack of knowledge about whether the
critical manufacturing processes could produce the product to
established cost, schedule, and quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. This uncertainty
is reflected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> estimates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50 percent</NUMEX> of
the time charged to build the initial production <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> will be
for engineering activities. Actual production labor is expected to
account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 percent</NUMEX> of the charged time.
To further understand the problems on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PAC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> program, we
focused on its seeker subsystem, which is key to acquiring and
tracking targets and represents a large percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>'s
cost. Currently, despite being in production, it is unclear whether
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> of the seeker can produce it within cost, schedule,
and quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. During development, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> had
difficulty in designing and manufacturing this subsystem. It was
not uncommon for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> to be built, tested, and reworked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> times before they were acceptable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> entered
production, despite these producibility issues. Now, even with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of production experience, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> continues to have
difficulty producing the seeker with acceptable quality. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2001</TIMEX> showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 25</NUMEX>
percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> were being manufactured properly the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and the rest had to be reworked, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX> Program According to program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX> did not have a stable design until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 2</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after the critical design review. A contributing factor to
this was a lack of understanding about the full requirements for
the new system at the critical design review in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. This led to a
major redesign of the common missile warning system's sensor. At
the critical design review, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 21 percent</NUMEX> of a product's
engineering drawings had been completed. It did not complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>

caused inefficiencies in manufacturing, rework, and delayed

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCM/CMWS</ENAMEX> program did not begin reliability growth testing
until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 years</TIMEX> after its critical design review, leaving only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> year
to test the system prior to scheduled production. Program officials
said that an immature design limited their ability to begin
reliability testing earlier in development. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About one-third</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> through the reliability growth test program, testing was halted
because too many failures occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> such as the power
supply, the high voltage electrical system, and the cooling system.
According to a program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, the inability to demonstrate
system reliability contributed to a production delay of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX>

limited production in the early part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> with significantly
less knowledge about the design's producibility than commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> does not use statistical process control
and has not identified critical manufacturing processes. A
production readiness review identified the lack of statistical
process control as a major weakness that needs to be corrected.

A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Match of Policy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Incentives Is Needed to Ensure</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense's</ENAMEX> (DOD) acquisition policy9
establishes a good framework for developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>;
however, disciplined adherence, more specific criteria, and
stronger acquisition incentives are needed to ensure the timely
capture and use of knowledge in decision making. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> changed its
acquisition policy to emphasize evolutionary acquisition and
establish separate integration and demonstration phases in the
product development process. Its goal was to develop higher quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> in less time and for less cost. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s acquisition
policy lacks detailed criteria for capturing and using design and
manufacturing knowledge to facilitate better decisions and more
successful acquisition program outcomes. As demonstrated by
successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, using these criteria can help ensure that the
right knowledge is collected at the right time and that it will
provide the basis for key decisions to commit to significant
increases in investment as product development moves forward.
While the right policy and criteria are necessary to ensure a
disciplined, knowledge-based product development process, the
incentives that influence the key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in the acquisition
process will ultimately determine whether they will be used
effectively. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>, current incentives are geared toward delaying
knowledge so as not to jeopardize program funding. These incentives
undermine a knowledge-based process for making product development
decisions. Instead, program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> push the
capture of design and manufacturing knowledge to later in the
development program to avoid the identification of problems that
might stop or limit its funding. They focus more on meeting
schedules than capturing and having the knowledge necessary to make
the right decisions at those milestones. Such an approach
invariably leads to added costs because programs are forced to fix
problems late in development.
By contrast, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> must develop high-quality
products quickly or they may not survive in the marketplace.
Because of this, they encourage their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to capture product
design and manufacturing knowledge to identify and resolve problems
early in development, before making significant increases in their
investment. Instead of a scheduledriven process, their process is
driven by events that bring them

knowledge needed to make informed decisions.
Greater emphasis on evolutionary acquisitions and structuring

its goals of buying higher quality systems in less time and for
lower costs. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> policy still lacks criteria to be used to
capture specific design and manufacturing knowledge and does not
require the use of that knowledge as exit criteria at key decision
points to transition from system integration to system
demonstration and then into production. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> DOD
program examples in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 3</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> decided to move forward in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, even when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> had failed to capture design and
manufacturing knowledge to support increased investments. As a
result, these programs encountered significant increases in
acquisition costs as well as delays in delivering capabilities to
the war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX> illustrates key criteria used by commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
that are currently lacking in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s policy. The table shows the
design and manufacturing knowledge needed to make more informed
decisions. The capture of some of the important manufacturing and
reliability knowledge should begin in the integration phase in
order to have the full knowledge needed to make decisions at the
end of the demonstration phase for transitioning into
production.

Best Practices for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Knowledge</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design and Manufacturing</ENAMEX>
Decisions




According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s current acquisition policy, the system
integration phase of an acquisition normally begins with the
decision to launch a program. The policy states that, during this
phase, a system's configuration should be documented and the system
should be demonstrated using prototypes in a relevant environment.
While these are noteworthy activities and resemble best practices,
the policy does not provide criteria for what constitutes the level
of knowledge required for completing this stage, nor does it
require a decision-based on those criteria-as to whether a
significant, additional investment should be made. Commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> demand knowledge from virtual or engineering prototypes,
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of required engineering drawings for the product
supported by test results, demonstration that the product meets
customer requirements, a series of disciplined design reviews, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stakeholder</ENAMEX> agreement that the design is stable and ready for
product demonstration before a commitment is made to move forward
and invest in product demonstration. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s revised policy, it
is still difficult to determine if a product should enter product
demonstration with a stable design.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Match of Policy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Incentives Is Needed to</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensure Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s current acquisition policy also states that the system
demonstration phase begins after prototypes have been built and
demonstrated in a relevant environment during system integration.
According to the policy, a system must be demonstrated before the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> will commit to production. The low-rate initial
production decision occurs after this phase of product development.
Like the end of system integration, the policy fails to provide
specific criteria for what constitutes the knowledge required to
support the decision to move into production. For example, the
policy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> there should be "no significant manufacturing risks"
but does not define what this means or how it is measured. Without
criteria for building knowledge during the demonstration phase, the
production decision is often based on insufficient knowledge,
creating a higher probability of inconsistent results and cost and
schedule problems. On the other hand, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> demand
proof that manufacturing processes are in control and product
reliability goals are attained before committing to production.
With more specific knowledge in hand at the end of development,
decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> can make a more informed decision to move into
production with assurances that the product will achieve its cost,
schedule, and quality outcomes.
Finally, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s policy separates product development into a
two-stage process-integration and demonstration-it does not require
a decision milestone to move from one stage to the next. The policy
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that an interim progress review should be held between the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stages, but the review has no established agenda and no
required outputs of information unless specifically requested by
the decision <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>. Its purpose is to confirm that the program is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progressing</ENAMEX> as planned. On the other hand, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
consider this review a critical decision point in their product
development process because it precedes a commitment to
significantly increase their investment. Therefore, they use
specific, knowledge-based standards and criteria to determine if
the product is ready to enter the next phase and they hold decision
makers accountable for their actions. These decision reviews are
mandatory and are typically held at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> level of the
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> illustrates the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> for knowledge to be
captured and delivered during product integration and product
demonstration and the possible application of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s
acquisition process. Without a similar decision review to bring
accountability to the DOD process, acquisition programs can-and
do-continue to advance into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration without a stable
design. As shown in our case

Incentives in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD Acquisition</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Environment Do Not Favor Capture</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design and Manufacturing</ENAMEX>
Knowledge Early Enough
The incentives for program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and product <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> to
gather knowledge and reduce risk are also critical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s ability
to adopt best practices for product development. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>, incentives
are centered on obtaining scarce funding on an annual basis in a
competitive environment to meet predetermined and typically
optimistic program schedules. These incentives actually work
against the timely capture of knowledge, pushing it off until late
in the process to avoid problems that might keep a program from
being funded. Because design and manufacturing knowledge is not
captured, key decision points intended to measure and ensure that a
weapon system has sufficiently matured to move forward in the
process risk becoming unsupported by critical knowledge. In leading
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, the opposite is true. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> know
they have to deliver high-quality products quickly and affordably,
they limit the challenge for their program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and provide
strong incentives to capture design and manufacturing knowledge
early in the process. Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are empowered to make
informed decisions before big investments in manufacturing
capability are required.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s current acquisition environment is driven by incentives to
make decisions while significant unknowns about the system's design
and manufacturability persist. This environment results in higher
risks and a greater reliance on cost-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">reimbursement10</NUMEX> contracts for
longer periods of time during product development. Because events
that should drive key decisions, such as critical design reviews,
interim progress reviews, and production decision reviews, are
based on inadequate design and manufacturing knowledge, they do not
support decisions to invest more and move to the next phase of the
acquisition process. Nevertheless, this approach has proven
effective in securing funds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-22</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAC-3</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATIRCMS/CMWS</ENAMEX> programs had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one-third</NUMEX> of their
engineering drawings completed at their critical design review, but
each obtained the funding necessary to move onto the initial
manufacturing of production representative prototypes. That funding
allowed a significant increase in investment to develop a
manufacturing capability before critical
10 Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowable
incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contracts. They are
suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract
performance, such as research and development work, do not permit
costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy. In contrast,
fixed-priced contracts, except those subject to price adjustment,
provide for a preestablished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> price, place maximum risk and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX>, and provide maximum incentive for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> costs and perform effectively.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Match of Policy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Incentives Is Needed to</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensure Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX>
knowledge had been captured. The incentive to capture funding
for the program was greater than the incentive to wait, capture
knowledge, and reduce the risk of moving forward. Each of these
programs encountered significant cost increases and schedule
delays.
The incentives are quite different for leading commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. For them, the business case centers on the ability to
produce a product that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> will buy and that will provide
an acceptable return on investment. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> has not made a
sound business case, or has been unable to deliver on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more
of the business case factors, it faces a very real prospect of
failure-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> may walk away. Also, if one product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> takes more time and money to complete than expected, it
denies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> opportunities to invest those resources in other
products. For these reasons, commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have strong
incentives to capture product knowledge early in the process to
assess the chances of making the business case and the need for
further investments.
Production is a dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
throughout the product development process and forces discipline
and trade-offs in the design process. This environment encourages
realistic assessments of risks and costs since doing otherwise
would threaten the business case and invite failure. For the same
reasons, the environment places a high value on knowledge for
making decisions. Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have good reasons to identify
risks early, be intolerant of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unknowns</ENAMEX>, and not rely on testing
late in the process as the main vehicle for discovering the
performance characteristics of the product. By adhering to the
business case as the key to success, program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in leading
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are conservative in their estimates and
aggressive in risk reduction. Ultimately, adherence to the business
case strengthens the ability to say "no" to pressures to accept
high risks and unknowns. Practices such as prototyping, early
manufacturing and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">supplier</ENAMEX> involvement, completing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of
engineering drawings by critical design review, demonstrating
product reliability, and achieving statistical control of critical
manufacturing processes by production are adopted because they help
ensure success.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s current acquisition environment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> is
willing to trade time and money for the highest performing weapon
system possible. That willingness drives the business case. This
creates strong incentives for the program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to take
significant risks with technologies and designs to ensure it can
offer the customer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon system</ENAMEX> that is a quantum leap above the
competition. In addition, because funding is secured on an
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Match of Policy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Incentives Is Needed to</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ensure Capture of Design and Manufacturing Knowledge</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> basis in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>, strong incentives exist for the program
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to make optimistic assumptions about development cost and
schedule. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> is willing to wait and funding is
never certain, an environment exists where program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have
good reasons to avoid the capture of knowledge and delay testing.
Since the business case in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> places very little premium on
meeting cost and schedule targets, but a very high premium on
performance, programs succeed at the point where sunk costs make it
difficult-if not prohibitive-for decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to cancel
them.
The practices commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> use to capture knowledge are
not currently used in this environment because the business case
does not favor them. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s product development environment
relies on cost-type contracting throughout the entire product
development process. Once in production, programs will cut
quantities to maintain funding or once fielded, they rely on the
operations and maintenance budget to pay for reliability problems
not solved in development.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense's</ENAMEX> (DOD) planned
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700 billion</NUMEX> investment in
Conclusions
weapon systems over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 5 years</TIMEX> requires an approach that
keeps cost, schedule, and performance risks to a minimum. This
approach means adopting and implementing an evolutionary approach
to developing new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>, improving policy to more closely
approximate a knowledge-based product development process, and
creating incentives for capturing and using knowledge for decision
making. Without an evolutionary approach as its foundation, the
ability to capture design and manufacturing knowledge early in the
development process is significantly reduced. Programs, in turn,
take on too much new unproven content to meet their objectives and
risks invariably increase. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> has made improvements in its
acquisition policy by incorporating guidance for evolutionary
acquisition, creating guidelines for the development of a basic
product that can be upgraded with additional capabilities as
technologies present themselves. However, evolutionary acquisition
has yet to be consistently implemented with success on individual
weapon system acquisitions.
Regardless of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> emphasized greater use of evolutionary
acquisition, acquisition programs are not capturing sufficient
design and manufacturing knowledge to make good decisions at key
investment points. The current policy establishes a good framework
to develop a product, but the policy still lacks specific criteria
required to move a program forward and does not tie knowledge to
decisions for increasing investments in the program as it moves
from system integration to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration. As a result,
programs often pass through each development phase and into
production with an unstable design and insufficient knowledge about
critical manufacturing processes and product reliability. This
results in greater likelihood for inconsistent and poor results and
cost and schedule problems later in the program.
Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> does not provide the proper incentives to
encourage the use of best practices in capturing knowledge early in
its development programs. Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are focused more on
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> exercise of obtaining funding needed to keep their
programs viable and alive. The importance of capturing design and
manufacturing knowledge early gives way to the pressures of
maintaining funding, often resulting in the acceptance of greater
risks. Raising problems on a program early because design and
manufacturing knowledge is discovered can cause extra oversight and
questions that threaten a system's survival. The prevailing
Recommendations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Action</ENAMEX>
culture is to accept greater risks upfront and then fix problems
later in the development program.
We found that leading commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> had
found ways to overcome these problems and had identified best
practices that resulted in the early capture of and use of design
and manufacturing knowledge. This was done by a combination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
key elements. First, they established and used an evolutionary
approach to develop products that made the capture of design and
manufacturing knowledge a more manageable task. This framework
limited the design challenge for any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new product development by
allowing risky technology, design, or manufacturing requirements to
be deferred until a future generation of the product. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s current
policy addresses this; however, it has not had sufficient time to
show how this will be implemented.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> we visited used the same basic product
development process and criteria for bringing together and
integrating all of the technologies, components, and subsystems
required for the product to ensure the design was stable and then
demonstrating that the product was producible and reliable using
proven manufacturing processes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s policy lacks the criteria to
measure design stability and process controls. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> used tools to capture design and manufacturing knowledge
about the product and decide about whether to invest further based
on that knowledge. Their new product development process included
key, high-level decision points before moving into product
demonstration, and again before making the production decision that
required specific, knowledge-based exit criteria. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s policy does
not require a decision to move from system integration to system
demonstration. Finally, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> created an environment
for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> that emphasized capturing design and
manufacturing knowledge early, before committing substantial
investments in a product development that made cancellation a more
difficult decision to make. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s environment encourages meeting
schedule milestones instead of capturing design and manufacturing
knowledge to make decisions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> should take steps to close the gaps between its current
acquisition environment and best practices. To do this, it should
ensure that its acquisition process captures specific design and
manufacturing knowledge, includes decisions at key junctures in the
development program, and provides incentives to use a
knowledge-based process. Such changes are necessary to obtain
greater predictability in weapon system

programs' cost and schedule, to improve the quality of weapon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> once fielded, and to deliver new capability to the war
fighter faster. More specifically, we recommend that the Secretary

decision review. At this point, the design should be demonstrated
to be stable so that during the next phase of development attention
can be focused on demonstrating manufacturing processes and product
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX>. The program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> should have proof-based on the
exit criteria for moving out of system integration in the above
recommendation-that the product design is stable. The exit criteria
should be demonstrated and verified by the program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> before
the program can make the substantial investments needed to begin
manufacturing production representative prototypes in the next
phase of development-system demonstration. To ensure visibility of
demonstrated exit criteria to decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, the criteria and the
program's status in achieving them should be included in each
program's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Acquisition Executive Summary</ENAMEX> and Selected
Acquisition Reports. If the program does not meet the exit
criteria, investments should be delayed until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">such time</TIMEX> as the
criteria are satisfied. To proceed without completing the required
demonstrations should require approval by the decision
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>.


•
Expand exit criteria for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Milestone C</ENAMEX> decision to
include the knowledge to be captured during the system
demonstration phase as identified in recommendation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. This will
require that the program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> demonstrate that the critical
manufacturing processes are under statistical control and that
product reliability has been demonstrated before entering
production of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon system</ENAMEX>. These are best practices and
indicate that the product design is mature and the program is ready
to begin production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> for operational use that will meet the
cost, schedule, and quality goals of the program.


•
To ensure that contracts support a knowledge-based
process, we further recommend that DOD structure its contracts for
major weapon system acquisitions so that (a) the capture and use of
knowledge described in recommendation one for beginning system
demonstration is a basis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s decision to invest in the
manufacturing capability to build initial prototypes and (b) the
capture and use of manufacturing and reliability knowledge
discussed in recommendation one for moving from system


<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Agency Comments and Our Evaluation</ENAMEX>
demonstration to production is a basis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s decision to
invest in production.
DOD concurred with a draft of this report and agreed with the
benefits of using design and manufacturing knowledge to make
informed decisions at key points in a system acquisition program.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> had some comments with regard to the details contained in the
recommendations, which are summarized below. DOD concurred with our
recommendation to add exit criteria at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key points in the
acquisition process-when transitioning from system integration to
system demonstration and from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> demonstration into production.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> believes, however, that the milestone decision authority needs
to retain flexibility in applying the knowledge requirement for
drawings. Flexibility and judgment are management prerogatives that
should exist in any decision process. We agree there may be
circumstances, such as in the development of software, when it
makes good sense to progress with less than the best practice
standard for drawings, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> policy should maintain the
requirement to achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> drawings by the completion of the
system integration phase.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> also concurred that critical manufacturing processes must be
demonstrated using statistical process control techniques before
production, but believes that achieving this at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Milestone C</ENAMEX>, the
low rate production decision, is unlikely. It believes the criteria
would be better applied to the full rate production decision or
when low rate production quantities extend beyond <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of the
planned weapon system buy. This is a reasonable approach when
processes are new or unique. However, not all critical processes
will be new or unique to a specific weapon system. Some will have
been used to manufacture parts or components for other systems or
products. At a minimum, it should be possible to demonstrate these
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milestone C. For</ENAMEX> other critical processes that may require
additional production experience to bring under statistical process
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, a program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> should have a reasonable plan at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Milestone C</ENAMEX> decision review to bring those processes into control
by the full rate production decision, but no later than completion
of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of the planned buy.
