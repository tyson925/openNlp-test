Cost-benefit analysis

A cost-benefit analysis was not required or prepared for the
rule.


(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
Act, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>


Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 605</ENAMEX>(b) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> certified in
the preamble to both the proposed rulemaking (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">33763,</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33771</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 29, 1995</TIMEX>)) and the final rulemaking (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20386, 20389</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 6, 1996</TIMEX>)) that the rule would not have a
substantial effect on a significant number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.1
Therefore, it was not required to prepare an initial or final
regulatory flexibility analysis under sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">604</NUMEX> of the
Act. For the same reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 607</ENAMEX> is inapplicable. While
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section 609</ENAMEX> likewise is inapplicable, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s submission to our
Office states that, in addition to publishing the proposed rule in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>, it took several steps to give small entities
the opportunity to participate in the rulemaking. Specifically, the
proposal was distributed to interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> by the twelve
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Banks</ENAMEX> and by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Securities</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dealers</ENAMEX>.
According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 605</ENAMEX>(b)
certifications were not provided separately to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business</ENAMEX>
Administration (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Counsel</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advocacy</ENAMEX>. Rather, in
accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s practice, publication of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">certifications</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> was treated as providing
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> has confirmed that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
follow this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> without objection from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>.
1The preamble to the final rule actually states that the rule
will not have a substantial "adverse effect" on a significant
number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker-dealers</ENAMEX>. However, we understand from the
preamble to the proposed rule and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s letter to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> intended this statement to constitute a
certification under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 605</ENAMEX>(b) that the rule would not have any
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> confirmed our understanding.

The rule does not impose information collection requirements
subject to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>.
Statutory authorization for the rule
The rule was authorized by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 7</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Exchange</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1934</ENAMEX>, as amended, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">78g</ENAMEX>, which directs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>
to prescribe regulations with respect to the amount of credit that
may be extended by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">broker-dealer</ENAMEX> on any non-exempted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>.
