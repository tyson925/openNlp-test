Subject: Contracts Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Self-Determination</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education Assistance Act</ENAMEX>
Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(A) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>,
this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Indian Affairs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Services</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Health Services</ENAMEX>, entitled "Contracts
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Self-Determination</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education Assistance Act</ENAMEX>"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RINs</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1076-AD21 and 0905-AC98</TIMEX>). We received the rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 21</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. It was published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> as a final rule on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 24, 1996</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32481</NUMEX>.
The joint rule is issued to permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> to award
contracts and grants to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> without the confusion
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of rules for a single program.
This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> attempt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> to issue such a
rule. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> directed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> to develop
regulations to implement amendments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Self-Determination Act</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pub</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93-638</NUMEX>) contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-Determination</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Education Assistance Act Amendments</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-23</NUMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pub</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L. 100-472</ENAMEX>). Those amendments were intended to increase
tribal participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Indian Programs</ENAMEX>
and to help ensure long-term financial stability for tribal-run
programs. When the proposed regulation was published for public
comment (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3166</TIMEX>), reaction was critical over the lack of
tribal participation in the latter stages of the drafting process
and the overall length of the proposed regulation.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reexamination</ENAMEX> of the regulation drafting process
led to the passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> Self-Determination Act Amendments
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pub</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">L. 103-413</ENAMEX>). This Act removed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' prior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX>' general legislative rulemaking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Act</ENAMEX> and limited it to certain subject matter
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas enumerated</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> required the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments</ENAMEX>, in issuing any new rules in those areas, to utilize
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990</ENAMEX> as a guide with the direct
participation of tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> in the rulemaking.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> chartered a negotiated rulemaking committee
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> Act to develop this rule. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between April 1995 and May 1996</TIMEX>.
The rule is the result of consensus by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> except in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> areas: internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> procedures, contract renewal
procedures, conflicts of interest and construction management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> of tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> met with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> to present the tribal views
of the unresolved areas and the rule incorporates the decisions
made based on that meeting.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enclosed</ENAMEX> is our assessment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of the Interior</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>' compliance with the
procedural steps required by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)(i) through (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>)
of title <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> with respect to the rule. Our review indicates that the
Departments complied with the applicable requirements.

(i)
Cost-benefit analysis

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> have advised our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> that they were not
required to prepare and did not prepare a cost-benefit analysis of
the rule.

Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
Act, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>


Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 605</ENAMEX>(b) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> certified
in the preambles to both the proposed rulemaking (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2038, 2044</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 24, 1996</TIMEX>)) and the final rulemaking (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32481, 32500</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 24, 1996</TIMEX>)) that the rule would not have a
substantial effect on a significant number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
Therefore, they were not required to prepare an initial or final
regulatory flexibility analysis under sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">604</NUMEX> of the
Act. For the same reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 607</ENAMEX> is inapplicable. While
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section 609</ENAMEX> likewise is inapplicable, the preamble in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register</ENAMEX> notes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> wanted to afford public
participation to the maximum extent and, therefore, the negotiated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rulemaking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> meetings were open to the public and all
sessions were announced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>.
According to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of the Interior</ENAMEX>,
publication of the certifications in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> was
treated as providing notice under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 605</ENAMEX>(b) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Administration</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Counsel</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advocacy</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>
has confirmed that some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> follow this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> without
objection from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>.
