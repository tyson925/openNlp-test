Preface
The federal government depends heavily on a variety of
information technology products and services to serve the public.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> on computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>, services, software, and telecommunications. The success
or failure of information system acquisitions affects executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' credibility with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the public as well as
their abilities to carry out their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> effectively and
efficiently.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of inspectors
general have consistently identified problems with information
technology acquisitions. Problems identified in numerous
evaluations include information systems that do not meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>'
needs, exceed cost estimates, or take significantly longer than
expected to complete.
This guide provides a logical framework for evaluating
information technology acquisitions. It incorporates a risk
assessment methodology intended to reduce audit planning time and
ensure that significant issues are included. It is based on a model
of the acquisition process developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> in cooperation with a
wide range of federal and private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 The</ENAMEX> model
outlines the process used to acquire information technologies and
identifies elements of the process that are essential for planning
and carrying out acquisitions.
This guide is intended for use in planning and conducting risk
assessments of computer hardware and software, telecommunications,
and system development acquisitions. A risk assessment is the
process of identifying potential risks in a system under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and then determining the significance of each risk in
terms of its likelihood and impact on the acquisition's cost,
schedule, and ability

to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s needs. Such assessments may have their
greatest impact if carried out early, when an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> can more
easily alter its acquisition plans and strategy to manage and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> the identified risks.
The audit guide consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, with appendixes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX> introduces the purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>, explains its
essential concepts and techniques, and provides direction in
tailoring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> for use on specific assignments. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chapters 2</ENAMEX>
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> address specific activities in the acquisition process.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> chapters present audit guidance on:


•
management and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> support,


•
project staffing,


•
needs/requirements/ specifications,


•
alternatives,


•
acquisition planning,


•
solicitation document,


•
source selection,


•
contract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and


•
test and acceptance.


Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> lists audit objectives, commonly expected
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX>, detailed audit questions, and references to federal
regulations and guidance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> are intended to assist in
the identification of specific risk areas and to contribute to an
overall assessment of how well an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is meeting its acquisition
objectives.
This audit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is also available in a software format,
accompanied by reference materials such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> model of the
acquisition process, relevant federal acquisition regulations,

Introduction
This audit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is based on and incorporates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s information
technology acquisition model. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> describes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> phases in
the acquisition process: presolicitation, solicitation and award,
and postaward. It sets out essential activities in each phase along
with critical factors related to those activities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is
intended to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> an overview of the acquisition process
and to help them decrease acquisition risks.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>'s critical factors were drawn from the judgment and
expertise of a wide range of knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from
government and private industry. Compliance with these critical
factors can increase the likelihood that an acquisition will meet
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s needs at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.
This guide is intended to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> conduct more
Objectives focused reviews of information technology
acquisitions by enabling them to quickly identify significant areas
of risk. Using this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> will help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> identify critical
factors not addressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, make a general assessment of
any procurement risks, and provide rapid feedback to agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> so they can take corrective action in a timely and
efficient manner. Use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> should be selectively tailored
to the requirements of particular reviews and adapted to the status
of the acquisition.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> will need to exercise professional judgment in
assessing the significance of audit results or findings. For
example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> assists <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in determining how an agency
identified and defined its requirements. Professional judgment is
necessary to evaluate this information and determine if the agency
conducted an adequate requirements analysis.

Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
Some areas of assessment will require the expertise of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
with specific technical skills and experience. These specific areas
include knowledge of solicitation procedures, benchmarking and
other performance or capability validation techniques, and
knowledge of technical areas such as database <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. These areas are identified within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX>. The audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> should include experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with
enough knowledge of information technologies to satisfy the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards</ENAMEX>
requirement that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have appropriate skills and
knowledge.
The audit approach described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is intended to result
in a risk assessment of an acquisition project at any point in its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> will be trying to determine whether a
project will result in a specified product or level of performance
and will be delivered at a specified time and cost. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>
should use this guide to identify areas that are most likely to
result in technical failures, unmet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs, cost overruns, or
schedule delays. Those risks should then be brought to the
attention of appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. The audit steps and
questions provided are directed toward assessing whether an agency
has sufficiently addressed critical factors, including support from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, adequate project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and controls over the
acquisition's scope before and after a contract is awarded.


Approach
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assignment Planning</ENAMEX>
When planning a risk assessment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should first review
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s acquisition policies and directives to identify the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> responsible for approving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">procurements</ENAMEX>. Approval thresholds, for example, should show which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have the authority to review and approve
acquisitions.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> and Use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Guide</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s directives should also show the specific milestones
and documentation required for a procurement.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should also review previous studies or audits of the
acquisition project and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s information resources
management functions. Reports by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> or other auditing institutions
can provide valuable background information. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should
also determine whether previous recommendations have been carried
out.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> of this audit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> focus on logically distinct
steps of the acquisition process, as described on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
acquisition model. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> The following table identifies the appropriate
chapters for reviewing the various steps of an acquisition. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> will want to concentrate on the steps that are
relevant to the phase of the acquisition being reviewed. However,
regardless of how far the acquisition has advanced, at a minimum
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should always ascertain whether senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> were involved in the project's initiation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should
also verify that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has defined its needs and requirements
to support its mission, and that those requirements continue to be
valid as the acquisition progresses through contract award and
contract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.

Each of the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> provides references to
regulations and other guidance relevant to material in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>.
In addition, each chapter identifies specific audit objectives and
documentation expected for the major activities at that point in
the acquisition process. The documents listed may exist with
different names than those used here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should refer to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>-specific requirements for more information. Finally, each
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX> sets out audit steps to help plan and conduct the
assessment of an acquisition. The questions may need to be tailored
to
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
the particular circumstances of an audit, using the subject
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s requirements.
The appendixes provide further information for use in planning
and conducting an acquisition audit. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix I</ENAMEX> contains a
worksheet, called an acquisition profile, to summarize essential
information about the acquisition project. The worksheet should
contain such information as the names and locations of units
responsible for the acquisition, the project purpose, and the
expected cost and time frames. The completed profile should be kept
available for later reference. If a profile exists from an earlier
assignment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should review and update it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix II</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> describes techniques to use in
identifying software development risks of delays and cost overruns,
known collectively as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> metrics or indicators. These
techniques require information about the size of the system being
developed and about progress after development has begun. Thus, the
techniques are only appropriate for use after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has
completed its design and progressed into developing the system. An
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> using this guide to review an acquisition that includes
significant software development and has a contract in place should
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review appendix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> for techniques to help identify variances from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s cost and schedule estimates. In some cases, the
project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> may be unable to complete a project on time due to an
unrealistic schedule. The cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> described in appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> can
be used to make a rough estimate of how long a system development
may require. Such an estimate can be compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> plans to
see if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has committed itself to unrealistically short
time frames. In other cases, delays in completing scheduled
activities, such as system design, coding, and testing, can lead to

Application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prototyping Methodology</ENAMEX>
slippage later on. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> will need to tailor the use of the
tools described in appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> to the circumstances of the
audit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix III</ENAMEX> provides a comprehensive list of references cited
throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> that may be useful
for technical information. Finally, a glossary is attached that
defines a wide range of technical and procurement terminology.
This acquisition guide is intended for use in reviewing any
information technology acquisition, regardless of the system
development methodology being used. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is structured around
the federal acquisition process, and is independent of development
methods for information systems. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should recognize that
there are different system development models that may be used when
a system development effort is acquired. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may include
the "waterfall" model, rapid prototyping, or evolutionary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Some of the documents required under different
development approaches may differ. Prototyping, for example, may
act as part of the requirements definition process, helping the
agency identify and control areas of high uncertainty and technical
risk. In this situation the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) focus on determining how one or more prototypesor
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incremental</ENAMEX> versions function to define the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s requirements
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) determine how the system development methodology used by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> controls the prototyping process.
One approach to using prototyping as part of the system
development process has been described as a "spiral" model of
system development. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> The spiral

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presenting Conclusions</ENAMEX> and Recommendations
model portrays a process in which an agency iteratively (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
determines its objectives, alternatives, and constraints; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
evaluates its alternatives and identifies and resolves risk issues;
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) develops and verifies its next-level products; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) plans
its next phases. Prototypes are developed or modified as part of
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase. As part of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, a prototype is developed
or revised whenever a risk analysis shows that significant areas of
uncertainty remain that pose substantial risks to project success.
When the system has been defined well enough to manage risks
effectively, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> develops and tests a full-scale system.
In order to review an acquisition that is using prototypes, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should determine what regulations or guidance the agency
has to define a prototyping methodology. This methodology will
establish the documentation and approval points that agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> should meet. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> can then measure the progress of
the prototypes against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s criteria.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should conclude the review by identifying
outstanding areas of risk and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s actions to address those
risks. Note should be made of how well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has addressed the
critical factors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> model of information technology
acquisitions as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> compliance with acquisition
regulations, standards, and other federal guidance. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Results of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review</ENAMEX> should be communicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> for their
comment, in accordance with government auditing standards.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should also recommend changes to ensure that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> is properly addressing the critical factors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
model. For example, the
3GAO<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.6</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1990</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> may recommend a greater role for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> if they are not
involved in approving alternatives or validating system
requirements. Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should recommend that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> take appropriate actions where senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> involvement
seems lacking, or where the project organization is unstable and
subject to high turnover. The recommendations should be reviewed
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and be appropriate to the probability and
significance of the risks identified.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>



Management and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">User Support</ENAMEX>
This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> focuses on levels of commitment and support for a
planned acquisition by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in an acquisition. Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> include those who
have overall agency responsibility for strategic, including
information-related, objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> are those who operate or
rely on agency information resources and include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and
staff responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> policies and programs supported by the
acquisition.
The involvement and support of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> throughout an
acquisition is essential for success. Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> should
envision the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s acquisition goals, define strategic
objectives, and oversee the projects that implement the overall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> or more senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> should act as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system sponsors</ENAMEX>,
with sufficient authority to ensure that applicable resources are
available for the project.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> should also be involved and provide support throughout the
acquisition to ensure that their requirements are understood and
that the resulting system is both accepted and used. User
involvement should be sustained from the needs determination phase
through final acceptance and implementation. User involvement in
the acquisition process will help avoid the development of products
that ultimately do not meet agency requirements.
The audit steps in this section should be used to assess the
potential risks posed by the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> support. An
acquisition that lacks either or both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> is at risk
of incurring unnecessary cost overruns, not meeting its planned
delivery schedule, and not satisfying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> needs.

by a program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> responsible for carrying out project
activities. The program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> should have sufficient authority
and an appropriate mix of skills and experience to successfully
manage the project.
The acquisition project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> should be assigned clear roles and
responsibilities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> should include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who are skilled
in the information technology procurement process, understand the
technology, and have experience in managing contracts. The team
should also have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> knowledgeable about the programs that the
acquisition is to support.

Needs <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/ Requirements / Specifications</ENAMEX>
The purpose of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> is to guide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> in
determining whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has developed an accurate
description of its information technology needs. The acquisition
should be clearly linked to program needs, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s overall
strategies, and to governmentwide policies and standards. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> should expand on its basic description of needs to define
specific requirements so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> of information technology can
respond with meaningful solutions. In some cases, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> may use
prototypes to help define or validate its requirements. The
requirements then form the basis for even more detailed
specifications.
In identifying its requirements, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should plan for
testing the information resources it needs. These plans should
cover acceptance, security, and certification requirements. The
test plans developed at this point form the basis for later
evaluations of contract performance.
Failure to clearly and accurately define information technology
requirements poses high risks for any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. For instance,
improperly defined requirements may preclude alternatives, restrict
competition, increase the risk of cost and schedule overruns, and
lead to systems that are inconsistent with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s overall
architecture and incompatible with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> systems. The
hardware or software purchased may also be inconsistent with
government standards. Designing and implementing a system is also
more difficult if input, output, and processing specifications are
incomplete or inaccurate. In addition, if security and internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> requirements are not well defined, control over sensitive
information or other assets may be lost.

Alternatives

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Objectives</ENAMEX>
After identifying its requirements, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should assess
alternatives for cost-effectively meeting those requirements. The
approach selected should reflect an understanding of what is
available in the commercial market as well as what is available
within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Approaching the acquisition this way will
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lessen</ENAMEX>, but not eliminate, the risk that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> may select an
alternative that does not fully meet user requirements or that is
unnecessarily complex and expensive.

Acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning</ENAMEX>
Acquisition planning is the process of coordinating and
integrating the efforts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> responsible for acquisitions.
A major objective of acquisition planning is to promote and provide
for full and open competition. To ensure that the planning is
accomplished in an effective, economical, and timely manner, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> should prepare an acquisition plan containing an overall
strategy for managing the preaward, acquisition, and postaward
phases.
An effective acquisition plan is critical to project success.
The plan sets out what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will do to complete a procurement
and how it will do it. The plan also specifies the type of contract
that will be awarded, how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will select a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX>, cost
and schedule goals, milestones, significant risk areas, and
contract management controls.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should assess the extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
acquisition planning is realistic and comprehensive. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> part of
this assessment should be the review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency Procurement</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Request</ENAMEX> (APR) to ascertain whether it is complete and accurately
reflects the objectives and scope of the project.
To verify that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has defined an effectiveAudit

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solicitation Document</ENAMEX>
A solicitation document provides information necessary for
vendors to propose equipment, software, and services to meet the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s requirements. In most cases, information resources will be
purchased by issuing an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX>, which forms the basis for the
resulting contract. Less commonly, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> may acquire
information resources using an invitation for bids. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX> may be
preceded by a request for information or request for quotation.
An RFP should be clear and comprehensive and include the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> described in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSA</ENAMEX>'s guidance on standard solicitation
documents. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> The areas of most interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> include section
C: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Description/Specifications/Work Statement</ENAMEX>, section
E: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inspection</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acceptance</ENAMEX>, and section <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evaluation Factors</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Award</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section C</ENAMEX> describes the tasks to be performed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> and the products to be delivered. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section E</ENAMEX> sets out
government and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> responsibilities in ensuring that
contract deliverables are acceptable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section M</ENAMEX>
explains how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> intends to select a winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> by
describing the importance of all factors to be considered in
evaluating proposals.
In developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> may hold presolicitation or
preproposal conferences in order to seek industry views on the
planned acquisition and to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to offer proposals.
Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX> is developed, it may be released in draft form in
order to obtain industry questions and reactions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should
determine what steps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has taken to get feedback on its
requirements, how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has handled comments or questions on a
proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX>, and whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has acted to ensure that
contractor proposals are competitive.
1See, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Resources Management Service</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overview Guide</ENAMEX>:
Acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Resources</ENAMEX>, (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1990</TIMEX>).
A proper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX> is a critical element of a successful acquisition
because it becomes part of the binding contract once a proposal is
made and accepted. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX> does not accurately and clearly
describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s requirements, or if the evaluation factors do
not accurately reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s priorities, then the resulting
acquisition may not meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX> is unjustifiably
restrictive, favoring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> over others, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> may be
unable to benefit from full and open competition.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should become familiar with the standard format for an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX>. The audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> should include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> sufficiently
knowledgeable about the information technology being purchased to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> how well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has defined its requirements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> should include or have access to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can
identify areas where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX> does not define the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s needs
well enough to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s interests. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
should also know enough about performance or capability validation
techniques to determine whether or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s requirements
are reasonable and effective.
Audit Objectives To determine whether or not the solicitation
document is complete, clear, and consistent, verify that
requirements continue to reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs, and determine if the
proposed evaluation process will result in an effective and
economical acquisition.

A clear definition of government and contractor
responsibilities.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
The relative importance of evaluation factors.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
A proposal format requiring that cost and
technicalelements be separated.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
Reasonable provisions that protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>(such as
liquidated damages provisions) or give incentives to the contractor
(such as bonuses for good performance). Identify option clauses
that create uncertainty in work-load projections.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Examine the evaluation criteria to ensure:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
They are consistent with the requirements
analysis,specifications, and proposal preparation
instructions.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
They provide all the factors and significantsubfactors to
be considered in evaluating offers and the relative importance of
different technical or cost factors, in accordance with FAR
15.605.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Evaluate the performance evaluation package theagency will
use. Determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> reimburses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> for
participating in benchmarking or other testing, and whether the
cost of such performance evaluation efforts constitutes a barrier
to competition.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
If there is a benchmark, has the benchmark been
independently examined by some outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>? Review the
benchmark plan to confirm that demonstration criteria are clearly
stated. Determine how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> selected a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> mix of
programs for the benchmark. Determine if the complexity of programs
in the benchmark is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the projected work load.
Determine how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> validated the benchmark as representative
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s work load.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
If there is simulation or modeling, determine how the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> selected parameters for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Review any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> or
complaints raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
If a compute-off (demonstration of prototypes) is to be
used, confirm that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has established plans for prototype
and follow-on contracts.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Interview <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, if necessary, todetermine
whether they concur with the solicitation. Determine whether users
or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> identify new or changed requirements not included in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX>. Find out if there are any factors considered important for
selecting an offer that are not included in the
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
evaluation criteria or if other included factors unfairly
restrict the competition. (For related information see ch. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, step
2g, under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">User Involvement</ENAMEX>.)


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
Review the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> selection plan to ensurethat
it clearly describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> selection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
activities. Ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> selection plan has been approved
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> selection authority before presolicitation
conferences are held or the solicitation document is issued, in

Source Selection
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> selection process is critical to securing the best
value for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. All proposals must be evaluated in
accordance with the criteria published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX>. If the
evaluation process does not conform to the RFP the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> runs a
greater risk of a successful bid protest by losing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> should receive proposals, evaluate the technical and cost
merits of different proposals, negotiate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>, and
award a contract in accordance with a source selection plan
developed before release of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should be aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
procedures for making a contract award. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies</ENAMEX> may use some or
all of the following positions:


•
Contracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX>). The Contracting Officer
publicizes the procurement, amends the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX> if necessary, and
conducts all negotiations with offerors.


•
Source <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selection Authority</ENAMEX> (SSA). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> makes the final
decision on contract award. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Contracting Officer</ENAMEX> may be the SSA
for some procurements, while in other cases a more senior manager
may serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX>.


•
Source <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selection Advisory Council</ENAMEX> (SSAC). The SSAC
reviews the evaluations of different proposals and makes a
recommendation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> on contract award.


•
Source <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selection Evaluation Board</ENAMEX> (SSEB). The SSEB
conducts technical and cost evaluations of vendor
proposals.

planned and carried out in order to successfully reach a contract
that gives the best value to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
If evaluation personnel strictly adhered to andapplied
the publicized evaluation process and criteria in the
solicitation.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
If evaluation factors were applied that were notlisted in

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Determine how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> received thesolicitation and
how many submitted proposals.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Determine if any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> submitted a protest and, ifso,
whether the protest was handled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>

Contract <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management</ENAMEX>
Contract management includes the steps required to ensure that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> receives products and services within established costs
and time frames. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is required to monitor contractor
performance, ensuring that work done conforms to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
requirements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> must also control changes to the contract
and accept or reject contract deliverables. Finally, an agency
should conduct postimplementation reviews to determine how well
acquisition goals were met and whether the information resources
acquired should be added to or replaced.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Contracting Officer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Contracting Officer</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative/Contracting Officer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> hold
primary responsibility for administering the contract. The
Contracting Officer monitors costs as required by the contract type
(fixed-price or cost<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-reimbursable</NUMEX>) and makes contract modifications
as needed. The program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> helps monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> performance
to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> requirements are met by the products or
services delivered and that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> provide support and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oversight</ENAMEX>.
A contract consists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RFP</ENAMEX>, as amended, and the
successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>'s proposal. The contract should specify all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deliverables</ENAMEX> required from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Contracting Officer</ENAMEX> and
Contracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative/Contracting Officer</ENAMEX>'s
Technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> should ensure that deliverables are
received as required. Any status and cost reports required from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> should be reviewed and action taken to correct problems,
if necessary. Training, documentation, and maintenance requirements
should be fulfilled.

Test and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acceptance</ENAMEX>
Testing provides the basis for making decisions on whether to
accept contract deliverables. For testing to be effective, it must
be addressed relatively early in the acquisition so it can be
properly included in planning. Test plans provide testing
procedures and the evaluation criteria to assess results of the
testing.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should establish its initial test plans in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">presolicitation</ENAMEX> phase. These plans should show how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will
verify that the acquired equipment, software, or services meet user
needs and satisfy security requirements. After a contract is
awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will need to carry out test and acceptance
procedures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should ensure that test planning is
conducted early enough so that test requirements are included in
the contract.
In assessing the postaward phase, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should ensure that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has not accepted equipment or software that does not
meet its requirements. The contract should specify conditions for
acceptable performance. For example, the contract may require that
a computer operate successfully for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 consecutive days</TIMEX> out of a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> test period. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> should ensure that the
contractor fully meets the conditions for acceptable performance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may be required to verify that the equipment or
software pass the specified tests.
Assessing the test and acceptance phase may require a high level
of technical skill on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, such as when an agency
has contracted for software development services and must test the
quality of delivered software. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should be able to
understand the system requirements, development methodologies, and
test tools being used.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> II



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Metrics</ENAMEX>

Purpose
This appendix describes tools and techniques for measuring the
status of acquisitions involving significant software development.
It describes techniques, known as software metrics, for
quantitatively measuring how closely a project conforms to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> plans and assessing whether an acquisition is at risk
of delay or cost increases. These techniques require considerable
information about the system being developed and can only be used
after system design. The metrics described here will generally be
used after contract award, in order to assess how well the agency
is managing the system development process.
Software metrics, which use mathematical models to measure
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the development process, are intended to help
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> better understand and manage the relationships
between resource decisions, development schedules, and the cost of
software projects. By using software metric tools an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> can
independently evaluate software development projects by analyzing
project budgets, requirements, schedules, and resources, and then
confirm or question cost, schedule, and resource estimates.
Different metrics may be useful for an audit, depending on the
objectives and status of an acquisition. Using cost models to
estimate the cost and length of time necessary to develop a new
software system, for example, is appropriate only after
requirements have been defined, a system design has been developed,
and the size of the new system has been estimated. The models
described here require estimates of either the lines of code or
number of function points that the new system will include. Cost
models project the time and cost to develop a system on the basis
of estimates of the system's size and other pertinent factors. They
may be used before a solicitation for software development is
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
issued in order to assess the reasonableness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
schedule (if a system design has been prepared), or after a
contract has been awarded and software development has begun. The
other metrics described in this appendix require that system
development work be underway. A comparison of the actual number of
functions successfully tested to the number planned in the
acquisition schedule, for example, requires that system testing be
underway.
Cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Models Cost</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are tools that estimate the effort
needed to develop software, based on assumed relationships between
the size of a system and the effort needed to design, code, and
test the software. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> can help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> assess whether
the acquisition's estimated cost and schedule are reasonable. Each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">model</ENAMEX> uses cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>, which are parameters such as the level of
experience of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX>, the reliability requirements of the
programs, and the complexity of the project, along with the
estimated project size, to derive overall cost and schedule
estimates for the acquisition. When a system involving software is
being developed, one or more cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> may be useful. A model
will be more reliable if it takes into account the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
historical experience in developing systems.
Cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are available both commercially and from a few
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>. Most of the tools were
developed initially for use with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>, but
can also be used with non-Defense systems. Many are based on
industry-recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Constructive Cost Model</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COCOMO</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRICE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Putnam</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jensen</ENAMEX>. The commercial tools range in
cost from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $500</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">well over $20,000</NUMEX>. Government-developed or
government-modified tools are available free of
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
charge with a nominal charge for upgraded copies of the
software.
Because many different packages are available, and because more
than one can be used, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should determine what <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, if
any, are used in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Typically cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are derived
using data gathered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from years</TIMEX> of experience with a wide range of
software projects. Therefore, accuracy of predictions may improve
as further experience is accumulated in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should use cost models to look for discrepancies with
the cost and schedule estimates established for an acquisition. By
varying the estimated values for cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> may also
be able to perform a sensitivity analysis illustrating where
project estimates are most susceptible to change. However, cost
models have significant limitations in accuracy unless their
underlying assumptions of system size and cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are
carefully chosen and reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s previous experience in
system development. It is a matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> judgment to decide
how discrepant project estimates and estimates provided by cost
models should be to raise concerns about risks of cost and schedule
overruns. In making this judgment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should take into
account the uncertainty of estimates and assumptions made in using
a cost model.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should use a cost model to provide general estimates
and not precise figures. Therefore, in applying software metrics to
audit work, care must be taken to follow generally accepted
government auditing standards when drawing conclusions based on the
results of software metrics. Specifically, all findings should be
qualified by the recognition that these tools are limited by the
accuracy of the
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
estimated system size and other project data provided for the
model, the historical data from which the model was developed, and
the fact that all estimates are projections of an inherently
uncertain future. Procedures for minimizing the effect of these
limitations require, for example, proper technical advice,
qualifying language in audit reports, and a review of data and
assumptions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should also ensure that the model used is consistent
with the software development methodology of the project under
consideration. A system developed through rapid prototyping, for
example, should be evaluated with a model that takes prototyping
into account.
The following indicators are intended to help auditors


Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indicators</ENAMEX>
assess how effectively an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is managing a system
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> contract. These indicators measure differences between
what an agency planned for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> to accomplish by certain
points in the systems development life cycle and the actual
results. In most cases this comparison is most easily done
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphically</ENAMEX>. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> indicator can give a broader
picture of a project's status. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should use indicators
appropriate to the project under review and for which data are
available.
Problem Reports This indicator involves tracking the number of
open and closed problems reported by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> as a system is
developed. A problem could be any anomaly discovered during design,
coding, testing, or implementation. Problems are distinguished from
failures of code, which represent defects discovered during
operation. Contracts should specify how problems are to be
identified and reported. By reviewing these reports and noting how
quickly
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
problems are resolved, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> can obtain an understanding of
how well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> is performing.
The project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Contracting Officer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> may be the best source for problem reports. Because
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> may choose to prioritize problems in order of their
impact, the reports should distinguish between priority levels of
problems.
Figure II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> shows one way to present this kind of analysis. It
shows the number of new problems reported and the number of
problems closed in order to show a trend over time and to show any
backlog that may be developing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> may also choose to
report total problems reported and resolved or break them out by
level of priority. Figure II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> shows the length of time that
problems have remained open in order to demonstrate how quickly
software problems are resolved once found. In this example, three
levels of priority are distinguished for reported problems.

Figure II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: Problems by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priority Levels</ENAMEX> and Number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Months</ENAMEX>
Unresolved

Software Volatility Software volatility is also measured
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphically</ENAMEX>. Figure II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> shows changes in the total number of
approved system requirements. Cumulative changes are also tracked,
including additions, deletions, and modifications to requirements.
Steady increases in the number of requirements and changes to
requirements may indicate that the project is at risk for delays
and cost overruns.
Figure II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Software Requirements Changes</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Progress</ENAMEX>
This indicator involves the comparison of actual and expected
progress in the design, coding, and integrating of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system units</ENAMEX>.
Units can be measured in terms of computer software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> or
computer software configuration items. If the project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> does not
complete its design or programming and testing activities as
planned, this indicator can show schedule delays before major
milestones are reached. The progress indicator can show all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of design, coding, testing, and integrating, or it may
treat them as separate indicators. Figure II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> shows how
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
planned and actual progress in the design and coding of software
units can be displayed.
Figure II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Progress</ENAMEX>

Software Size This indicator records changes in the expected
magnitude of the software development effort. The size of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, measured in source lines of code as established by the
system design, may change as the system is coded. Changes in size
can be expressed
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/IMTEC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessing Acquisition</ENAMEX> Risks
as total lines of code or can be broken out into new, modified,
and reused lines of code. Changes in the estimated system size may
indicate that the project was overestimated or underestimated in
size and complexity. These changes may also indicate that
requirements are changing and may be related to the software
volatility issue described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. Increasing estimates of
software size should alert the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> that the project's schedule
and expected cost may be underestimated. Changes in the expected
system size may necessitate reestimates of the development cost,
using the cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> described earlier in this appendix. Figure
II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> shows how the estimates of software size can be tracked over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
Figure II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Software</ENAMEX> Size Estimates

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Personnel</ENAMEX> Stability Tracking the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> assigned
to a system development effort compared to planned staffing levels
provides another indicator of potential problems. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> can
examine projected versus actual levels of total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> or of
key, experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. Understaffing may result in schedule
slippage. Adding personnel late in a project can actually cause
further slippage.
Other metrics may be chosen as needed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> could, for
example, compare expected to actual usages of hardware resources in
order to identify emerging computer capacity problems. Another
approach would involve tracking changes to the estimated completion
date for a system. The metrics described here offer suggestions to
be tailored for use as appropriate to particular projects.

Acquisition
The obtaining, by contract with appropriated funds, of supplies
or services (including construction) by and for the use of the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> through purchase or lease, whether the supplies
or services are already in existence or must be created, developed,
demonstrated, and evaluated. Acquisition begins at the point when
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> needs are established and includes the description of
requirements to satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> needs, solicitation and selection of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, award of contracts, contract financing, contract
performance, contract <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, and those technical and
