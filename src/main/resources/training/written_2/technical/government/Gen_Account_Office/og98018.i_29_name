The final rule adopts a new standard for foreign participation

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basic Telecommunications</ENAMEX> Services (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agreement</ENAMEX>). The procedures will
provide opportunities for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> to deliver satellite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> here, and the liberalized market conditions resulting from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Agreement</ENAMEX> will allow

(i)
Cost-benefit analysis

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>, in its report to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>, states that it was not
required to prepare and did not prepare a cost-benefit analysis of
the final rule.


(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act, 5 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 603-605, 607</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">609</NUMEX>


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> prepared both an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
and a Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>, which appeared in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preambles</ENAMEX> to the proposed rule and the final rule,
respectively.
The analyses describe the reason for the rule and the legal
basis for it. They also include descriptions of the number of small
entities affected by the rule; discussions of the recordkeeping,
reporting, and other compliance requirements; and the steps taken
to minimize the burdens on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
In the Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> finds that
there will be no economic impact on small businesses. No additional
burdens are being imposed on foreign-licensed systems, large or
small, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> will apply the same rules that have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> licensed systems.
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the

The final rule contains a modification of a previously approved
information collection requirement under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction</ENAMEX>
Act.

required by the act, including the need and use of the information,
the estimated number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, and the annual burden hours
imposed.
The information will be used to evaluate the legal, technical,
