Cost-benefit analysis

A cost-benefit analysis was not required or prepared for the
rule.

Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
Act, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. ยงยง</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> determined that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the fee
schedule--specifically, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> fee for materials
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">licensees</ENAMEX>--will have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> prepared an initial
and final regulatory flexibility analysis under sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">604</NUMEX> of title <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, respectively.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 603</ENAMEX>: Initial regulatory flexibility analysis
The proposed rulemaking, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2948</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 30, 1996</TIMEX>),
incorporates in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Supplementary Information</ENAMEX> the full text of an
initial regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact
of the proposed rule on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. This analysis was
transmitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA Chief Counsel</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advocacy</ENAMEX>, as required by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subsection</ENAMEX> 603(a).
The analysis included in the proposed rulemaking provides the
information required by paragraphs 603(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) through (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>). It
describes the reasons for the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> action, and its
objectives and legal basis--i.e., to comply with the costrecovery
requirements of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 6101 of the Omnibus Budget</ENAMEX> Reconciliation
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1990</ENAMEX>. It also describes the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> to which the
proposed rule will apply and estimates their number. With respect
to paragraph 603(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Supplementary Information</ENAMEX> states that
the proposed rule does not impose reporting or other
information-collection requirements. With respect to paragraph
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>), the analysis does not identify any relevant federal
rules that may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed
rule. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> advised us that there are no such rules.
With respect to subsection <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX>(c), the analysis describes several
alternative means of assessing fees for small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that might
lessen the economic impact of the rule on them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 604</ENAMEX>: Final regulatory flexibility analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Information</ENAMEX> published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>
with the final rule includes the full text of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s
final regulatory flexibility analysis. See Appendix A to the Final
Rule, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">16224-16226</ENAMEX>. This analysis includes the
information required by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subsection 604</TIMEX>(a). In particular, it
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">summarizes</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/OGC-96-9</ENAMEX> evaluates comments concerning alternative means of
establishing fees for small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and evaluates these
alternatives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> determined to retain its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior year</TIMEX>
practice of mitigating the impact of the fees by establishing
maximum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> fees for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 605</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Avoidance</ENAMEX> of duplicative or unnecessary
analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> did not invoke any of the exemptions or special
procedures authorized by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 605</ENAMEX> in preparing its regulatory
flexibility analyses. Its impact analyses do consider information
and comments developed in connection with its fee schedule rules
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 607</ENAMEX>: Preparation of analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s analyses use both quantifiable and general
descriptions of the effects of the rule and alternatives on small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 609</ENAMEX>: Participation by small entities
In addition to the actions required by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. ยง</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">553</ENAMEX>, the
Commission transmitted a complete copy of the proposed and final
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rulemaking</ENAMEX> materials to each of its licensees, including small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>.
