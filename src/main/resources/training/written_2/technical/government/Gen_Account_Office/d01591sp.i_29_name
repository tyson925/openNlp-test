Preface
The term "saving" is used both when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> discuss their own
finances and when policymakers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> discuss "national
saving." For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, saving means forgoing
consumption <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> so they can enjoy a better standard of living in
the future. National saving-the portion of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s current
income not consumed-is the sum of saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>,
and all levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. National saving represents resources
available for investment to replace old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> and equipment and
to buy more and better capital goods. Higher saving and investment
in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital stock contribute to increased productivity
and stronger economic growth over the long term. Saving today
increases a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capacity to produce goods and services in the
future and, therefore, helps to increase the standard of living for
future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, combined saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and business has
declined. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">much of that time</TIMEX>, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> did not
contribute to saving; instead it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrower</ENAMEX>, its deficits
absorbing a share of the saving pool available for investment. For
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> as a whole, saving has rebounded somewhat from its low
point in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX> but remains relatively low by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
historical standards. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1998</TIMEX>, the federal government
began to contribute to the pool of saving by running its first
surplus since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> budget surpluses now are projected for
at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX>. But even with the advent of federal
government saving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX>, national saving available for
new investment remains relatively low, in large part because
personal saving has dramatically declined. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> has been able
to invest more than it saves by borrowing from abroad, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> question whether this is a viable strategy for the long
term.
Personal saving plays a dual role, ensuring both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>'
retirement security and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s economic security. While
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> provides a foundation for retirement income, saving
through pensions and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> on their own behalf contribute
substantially to retirement income. Even as more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
accumulating balances through employer-sponsored 401(k) saving
plans and individual retirement accounts, personal saving-which
does not reflect gains on existing assets-has declined. The
personal saving rate has plunged, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> households spending
virtually all of their current income. Although aggregate household
wealth has risen in part as a result of the stock market boom over
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1990s</NUMEX>, many individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have accumulated little, if
any, wealth.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> faces a demographic tidal wave that poses significant
challenges for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' retirement security and our economy as
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX>. More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are living longer in retirement, and there
will be relatively fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> supporting each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retiree</ENAMEX> in the
future. Without meaningful reform, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
programs face long-term financing problems. Although public
attention usually focuses on the dates by which the trust funds are
projected to become insolvent, the effects associated with
financing cash deficits for these programs will be felt sooner as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> boom generation begins to retire. As the population ages,
spending for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and federal health programs will leave
increasingly less room for spending on other national
priorities.
Increasing national saving is an important way to bolster
retirement security for current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and to allow future workers
to more easily bear the costs of financing federal retirement and
health programs while maintaining their standard of living. As we
have reported in the past, the surest way for the federal
government to affect national saving is through federal fiscal
policy, particularly in what it chooses to do with the budget
surpluses projected over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Policymakers</ENAMEX> appear to
have agreed to save the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses, and the fiscal
policy debate has centered on what to do with the balance of the
anticipated surpluses. To the extent that they are used to reduce
federal debt held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, surpluses represent an opportunity
to increase national saving. In addition, how surpluses are used
has long-term implications for future economic growth. Policy
debates surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> reform also have
implications for all levels of saving-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, personal, and,
ultimately, national.
This report is designed to present information about national
saving-as measured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Income</ENAMEX> and Product Accounts-and
its implications for economic growth and retirement security in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concise</ENAMEX> and easily understandable manner. In general, this report
is based on widely accepted economic principles, and we identify
those areas where many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> do not agree. Although many
excellent studies and books have been written on national saving
and long-term economic growth, these discussions tend to be complex
and technical. Also, most discussion of the decline in personal
saving focuses on the adequacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' retirement saving
rather than on the significance of personal saving for the economy
as a whole. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point that is sometimes overlooked is
that low personal saving has consequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> reliance on
foreign borrowing, long-term economic growth, and standards of
living for future generations.
This report addresses the following questions: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) What is
personal saving, how is it related to national saving, and what are
the implications of low personal saving for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' retirement
security? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) What is national saving and how does current saving
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> compare to historical trends and saving in
other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) How does national saving affect the economy
and how would higher saving affect the longterm outlook? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) How
does federal fiscal policy affect national saving, what federal
policies have been aimed at increasing private saving, and how
would <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> reform affect national saving?
And, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) what are key issues in evaluating national saving? For a
quick overview of the topics discussed in this report, see the
summary section.
For easy access to definitions of key terms, we include a
glossary at the end of this report. Terms contained in the glossary
appear in bold type in the text the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time they are used in the

Personal Saving and Retirement
Security
The personal saving rate-as measured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Income</ENAMEX> and
Product Accounts (NIPA)-reflects how much <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in aggregate
are saving from their current disposable income. In evaluating
personal saving, it is important to distinguish between saving as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> for an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> to finance future consumption and
saving as a way to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital formation. Strange
as it may seem to the typical household, capital gains on its
existing assets do not contribute to saving as measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX>.
That is because capital gains reflect a revaluation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
existing capital stock and do not provide resources for financing
investment that adds to the capital stock. Whereas employer
contributions to pension funds as well as pension funds' interest
and dividend income are part of personal income and contribute to
personal saving, increases in the market value of assets held by
pension funds, for example, are not counted as personal income and
saving. Although an individual household can tap its wealth by
selling assets to finance consumption or accumulate other assets,
the sale of an existing asset merely transfers ownership; it does
not generate new economic output.
The personal saving rate has largely declined since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>,
plummeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> to levels not seen since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Depression</ENAMEX>, as shown in figure S.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A low personal saving rate
raises questions about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have adequate resources
to sustain their rate of spending. A negative saving rate means
that, in aggregate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are spending more than their current
income by drawing down past saving, selling existing assets, or
borrowing.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> use several theories to explain what motivates people
to save. Despite a great deal of study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have found no
single reason that convincingly explains the decline in the
personal saving rate. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible explanation is that surging
household wealth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> contributed to the virtual
disappearance of personal saving. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1990s</TIMEX>, aggregate
household wealth has swelled relative to disposable personal
income, largely due to increases in the market value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>'
existing assets (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>). Yet, despite the stock market
boom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have accumulated little, if any,
wealth (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> did not
own stocks as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> provides a foundation for retirement
income, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits replace <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 40 percent</NUMEX> of
pre-retirement income for the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> benefits must be supplemented by private pensions,
accumulated assets, or other resources in order for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to
maintain a reasonable standard of living in retirement compared to
their final working <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pensions</ENAMEX>, income from accumulated
assets, and earnings from continued employment largely determine
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> will have the highest retirement income (see
figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>). Pensions are not a universal source of
retirement income, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of those working in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
lacked a pension plan. While most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> say they recognize the
need to save for retirement,
National Saving Overview
fewer than half of those surveyed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2001</TIMEX> had tried to
calculate how much they need to save.
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 75 years</TIMEX>, the elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will nearly
double as a share of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>). As
more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live longer, there will be relatively fewer workers
supporting each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retiree</ENAMEX> unless retirement patterns change. While
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX>,
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2030</TIMEX>, there will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> paying taxes to support
each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> face long-term financing problems, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare's Hospital Insurance</ENAMEX> trust funds eventually will be
exhausted as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> draw their benefits (see figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>). Absent reform, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> costs would
constitute a substantial drain on the earnings of future workers
(see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.10</NUMEX>). Anticipating potential benefit cuts, people
could choose to save more now, work longer to delay retirement, or
experience a lower standard of living in retirement. With an aging
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and a slowly growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>, saving more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and
increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s future economic capacity is critical to
ensuring retirement security in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX>, national saving is the sum of saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and all levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Gross national
saving-which reflects resources available both to replace old, worn
out capital goods and to expand the capital stock-has rebounded as
a share of gross domestic product (GDP) from its low in the 1990s
but remains below the level of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>).
Depreciation as a share of GDP has increased slightly over the past
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, and net national saving-which excludes
depreciation-remains well below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> average, as shown in
figure
S.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Through much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>, federal deficits
absorbed funds saved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and reduced
overall national saving available to finance private investment
(see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>). Even as federal surpluses have contributed to
national saving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, personal saving has steadily
declined as a share of GDP, and personal dissaving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> absorbed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> that otherwise would have been available for investment.
Although gross national saving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> was low by
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> historical standards, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> gross national saving has
generally been lower than other major industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> over
the past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>).

Source: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Economic</ENAMEX>
Analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Commerce</ENAMEX>.
National saving represents resources available for investment in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s stock of capital goods, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX>, equipment, and
housing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s human capital and knowledge-forms of
intangible capital-are not part of the NIPA definitions of saving
and investment. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> focuses on the incomes arising from
current production of goods and services and, thus, does not count
revaluation of existing assets in national saving. Changes in the
market value of existing tangible and financial assets, such as
land and stocks, reflect expectations about the productive
potential of the underlying capital, but fluctuations in asset
values may not represent real, permanent changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
productive capacity.
National saving together with borrowing from abroad provides the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> for investment that can boost productivity and lead to
higher economic growth and future living standards (see figure
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.1</NUMEX>). Investment in new capital is an important way to raise the
productivity of the slowly growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> as the population
ages. Greater economic growth from saving more now would make it
easier for future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to achieve a rising standard of living
for themselves while also paying for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s commitments
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>. Economic growth also depends on education to
enhance the knowledge and skills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s work
National Saving and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
force-the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s human capital-as well as research and
development to spur technological advances.
Even though national saving remains relatively low by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
historical standards, economic growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> has been high
because more and better investments were made. Each dollar saved
bought more investment goods, and a greater share of saving was
invested in highly productive information technology. Also, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> was able to invest more than it saved by borrowing
from abroad (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>). Persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> current account
deficits have translated into a rising level of indebtedness to
other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, i.e., net <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> holdings of foreign assets (see
figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX>). Many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> currently financing investment in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> also will face aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and declining
national saving, so relying on foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX> to finance a large
share of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> domestic investment is not a viable strategy for the
long run.
Current saving and investment decisions have profound
implications for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s level of well-being in the future.
Our simulations using a longterm economic growth model show that,
even assuming the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> could maintain national saving
constant at its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> share of GDP, future incomes would fall short
of the rise in living standards enjoyed by prior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> whose
income generally doubled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 35 years</TIMEX> (see figures
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.4 and 3.5</NUMEX>). Saving more would improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s long-term
economic outlook, but this requires consuming less now.
Federal fiscal policy affects the amount of federal government
saving and this in turn directly affects national saving. From the
1970s through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1990s</TIMEX>, federal deficits absorbed a large
share of private saving and reduced the amount of national saving
available for investment (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX>). Borrowing to finance
these deficits added to the federal debt held by the public. In
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, federal surpluses added to national saving and
increased funds available for investment. So far, the federal
government has used surplus funds to reduce its debt held by the
public. Accumulating nonfederal financial assets, such as stocks,
could be another way that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saving could translate into
resources available for investment, but this idea is controversial.
An additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> of government saving and debt reduction does
not automatically increase national saving and investment by a
dollar because changes in saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> will
tend to offset some of the change in government saving.
While attention has focused on budget surpluses projected over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next decade</TIMEX>, the federal budget will increasingly be driven by
one certainty-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is aging and there will be fewer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> supporting each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retiree</ENAMEX>. In our simulations, saving only
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses will not be sufficient to accommodate
both the projected growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entitlements</ENAMEX> as well as other important national priorities in the
long term (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>). Absent program changes, saving the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses-and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> surpluses-is not
enough to ensure retirement security for the aging population
without placing a heavy burden on future generations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> and health spending alone eventually would exceed total
federal revenue and squeeze out most or all other spending (see
figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX>). Even if the entire unified surplus were saved, our
simulations show that the rise in living standards- measured in
terms of GDP per capita-would fall short of the rise enjoyed by
prior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> whose income generally doubled every 35 years
(see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX>). Reforming retirement and health entitlement
programs is critical to putting the federal budget on a more
sustainable footing for the long term and to freeing up future
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> for other competing needs.
Although increasing government saving is the most direct way for
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to increase national saving, budget
surpluses also could be used to finance federal investment intended
to promote long-term economic growth or to encourage personal
saving. Whereas unified budget surpluses increase national saving
available for private investment, increasing federal spending on
national infrastructure, if properly designed and administered, can
be another way to increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital stock. In addition,
federal spending on education and research and development-while
not counting as investment in NIPA-can, if properly designed and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">administered</ENAMEX>, promote the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s long-term productivity and
economic growth. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> also has sought to
encourage personal saving both to enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> and to boost national saving. But, developing policies
that have the desired effect is difficult. Tax incentives affect
how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save for retirement but do not necessarily increase the
overall level of personal saving. Even with preferential tax
treatment for employer-sponsored retirement saving plans and
individual retirement accounts, the personal saving rate has
steadily declined. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> disagree about whether tax incentives
are effective in increasing the overall level of personal saving.
The net effect of a tax incentive on national saving depends on
whether the tax incentive induces enough additional saving by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to make up for the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saving resulting
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s revenue loss. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, policymakers
have explored using government matching or creating new individual
accounts to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to save more.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> found that a leading obstacle to expanding retirement
saving has been that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> do not know how to save for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retirement</ENAMEX>, let alone how much. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX> maintains
an outreach program to raise public awareness about the advantages
of saving and to help educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> about how much they need to
save for retirement. Other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> also play a role in
educating the public about saving. Individualized statements now
sent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Administration</ENAMEX> to most workers
aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 and older</TIMEX> provide important information for personal
retirement planning, but knowing more about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s
financial status would help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to understand how to view their
personal benefit estimates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restoring Social Security</ENAMEX> to sustainable solvency and increasing
saving are intertwined national goals. Saving for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
retirement costs is analogous to an individual's retirement
planning in that the sooner we increase saving, the greater our
benefit from compounding growth. The way in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
is reformed will influence both the magnitude and timing of any
increase in national saving. The ultimate effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
reform on national saving depends on complex interactions between
government saving and personal saving-both through pension funds
and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> on their own behalf. Various proposals would
create new individual accounts as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> reform or
in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>. The extent to which individual
accounts would affect national saving depends on how the accounts
are funded, how the account program is structured, and how people
adjust their own saving behavior in response to the new
accounts.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program is fiscally burdensome in its current form,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>) is expected to drive federal
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissaving</ENAMEX> over the long run. Given the aging of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the increasing cost of modern medical technology, it
is inevitable that demands on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program will grow. The
current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program lacks incentives to control health care
consumption, and the cost of health care decisions is not
transparent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>. Although future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> costs are
expected to consume a growing share of the federal budget and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, pressure is mounting to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s benefit package
to cover prescription drugs, which will add billions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
program costs. In balancing health care spending with other
societal priorities, it is important to distinguish between health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> wants, which are virtually unlimited; needs, which should be
defined and addressed; and overall affordability, which has a
limit. Reducing federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending would improve future
levels of government saving, but the ultimate effect on national
saving depends on how the private sector responds to the
reductions.
Key Issues In light of the virtual
disappearance of personal saving, concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> reliance on
borrowing from abroad to finance domestic investment, and the
looming fiscal pressures of an aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, federal
decisionmakers must consider how much of the anticipated budget
surpluses to save, spend, or use for tax reductions. Economic
growth will help society bear the burden of financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, but it alone will not solve our long-term
fiscal challenge. To participate in the debate over how to reform
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, the public needs to understand the
difficult choices the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> faces.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 1</ENAMEX>
Personal Saving and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retirement Security</ENAMEX>
Q1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. What is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Personal Saving Rate and</ENAMEX>
What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Does it Mean</ENAMEX>?
A1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. The personal saving rate is the most widely cited
statistic about how much households save, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not
know what the rate measures or what it means. First, it is
necessary to distinguish "saving" from "savings." In everyday
terms, "saving" means spending less than your income and "savings"
are the assets accumulated over time. To better distinguish between
these concepts in this report, the term "saving" means the money
set aside from current income for future consumption-i.e., how much
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each period</TIMEX>'s income is saved rather than spent. The terms
"assets accumulated" and "wealth" are used for the cumulative stock
of resources built over time-what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> commonly think of as
"savings."
The personal saving rate, as measured in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Income</ENAMEX> and
Product Accounts (NIPA)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX> reflects how much <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are
setting aside from current income. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NIPA</ENAMEX>, personal saving is
what is left over from personal income after taxes and personal
spending for goods and services. Disposable personal income is the
income available for personal spending and saving after federal,
state, and local taxes as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
payroll taxes are paid. The NIPA personal saving rate is calculated
as the ratio of personal saving to disposable personal income.
To understand what the personal saving rate means, it is helpful
to understand the NIPA definitions of "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>," personal income,
and personal spending. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> purposes, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>" include not
only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> but also nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> primarily serving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, pension funds, and private trust funds. NIPA personal
income includes wages and salaries; interest and dividend income;
rental income;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proprietors</ENAMEX>' income; government transfer payments,
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX>, and unemployment benefits; and
employer contributions to pension plans as well as group health and
life insurance plans. Contributions to traditional defined benefit
pension plans and defined contribution plans-such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">401</NUMEX>(k)
plans-together with pension

personal income.
funds' interest and dividend income represent an important
component of NIPA personal income and saving<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> Benefits paid by
pension plans are not a component of NIPA personal income, although
pension benefits represent an important means for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> consumption (see Q1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>). NIPA personal spending includes,
for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, clothing, rent, utilities, and medical care;
consumer interest payments; and consumer durables, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
major appliances<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
Strange as it may seem to the average household, changes in the
value of existing assets, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate, do
not contribute to NIPA personal income and saving. That is because
capital gains reflect a revaluation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s existing
capital stock and do not provide resources for financing investment
that adds to the capital stock. Under the current NIPA methodology,
realized gains do not count as personal income, but any taxes paid
on such gains reduce disposable personal income and thus personal
saving.
Although the NIPA personal saving rate is the measure most

personal saving because it more closely represents the resources
available from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital formation.
For the economy as a whole, the personal saving rate provides a
measure of how much <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are saving compared to current
disposable personal income. A positive saving rate means that
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in aggregate are saving. A low personal saving
rate means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in aggregate are spending virtually all
of their current income. A negative personal saving rate means
that, in aggregate, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are spending more than
their current income-or "dissaving." Given that the personal saving
rate is an aggregate measure, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> might be saving a
lot even while others are drawing down past saving, selling
existing assets, or borrowing to finance their current
consumption.
A1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>. For the economy as a whole, personal saving can be a vital
source of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s saving available to finance private and
government investment. NIPA personal saving is widely recognized by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> as the key measure of the resources that households
contribute to national saving. A low personal saving rate-unless
offset by relatively higher saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and/or government
or by borrowing from abroad-limits how much the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> can invest
and so ultimately limits future economic growth. A low personal
saving rate can raise questions about whether current generations
are setting aside enough to sustain the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s productive
capacity, especially if the other components of national saving are
not correspondingly higher. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are concerned that the
demand for household consumption is in part fueling the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade
deficit. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 2</ENAMEX> discusses the trend and the components of
national saving, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 3</ENAMEX> explains how saving affects
long-term economic growth and living standards.
The personal saving rate also has implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>'
ability to sustain their current rate of spending. Personal
spending represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy. A low
personal saving rate raises questions about whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have
adequate resources to withstand a financial emergency such as
unemployment in the event of an economic downturn. In addition,
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policymakers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> have questioned whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are saving enough to ensure their retirement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>.
Having said this, it is important to recognize that
macroeconomic measures such as the NIPA personal saving rate do not
provide a complete picture of
Q1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>. How Has the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Personal Saving Rate</ENAMEX>
Changed Over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>?
the finances of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX>'s capacity to
consume depends on both its current income and its wealth. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way
to measure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' wealth is net worth, or the difference
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' assets and their liabilities<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> The change in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' net worth is broader than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> or FFA measures of
personal saving and includes both the flow of saving from current
income plus any increase (or decrease) in the market value of
existing assets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and stocks. For the economy as a
whole, however, the change in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' net worth due to
revaluation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' existing assets does not represent
resources available to invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital stock.7
A1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> shows the personal saving rate-expressed as a
percentage of disposable personal income-over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 4 decades</TIMEX>.
The personal saving rate averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.3 percent</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and
increased to an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.6 percent</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
of those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, annual saving rates were relatively steady,
although they ranged from a low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.2</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> to a high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.7</NUMEX>
percent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, the personal saving rate was
slightly lower than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. After peaking at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.9 percent</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, the rate generally declined over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, dropping as low
as to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.3 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>; for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX>, the rate averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX>
percent. The personal saving rate rebounded from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987 to 1992</TIMEX> when
it reached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.7 percent</NUMEX>. Since then, the personal saving rate has
steadily declined and averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5.9 percent</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>. In
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1990s</TIMEX>, the personal saving rate dropped below the postwar
low of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the personal saving rate
plunged to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2 percent</NUMEX>-an annual rate not seen since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Depression</ENAMEX>. As shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>, the personal saving rate in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> was estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.1 percent</NUMEX>.8 With the personal saving
rate around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or negative, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have questioned how to
interpret the decline; see question <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7</NUMEX>.

A1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>. Before trying to answer why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are saving less, let's
start with the question of what motivates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to save. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
save for a variety of reasons such as buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, taking a
vacation, providing a college education for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, or
preparing for their own retirement. They may also save for general
reasons such as for a "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rainy day</TIMEX>" or to leave money to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> with seemingly identical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and income situations may
make different saving choices-some may save a great deal while
others save little, if anything. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> use
several theories in analyzing how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> decide
how much of their current income to save for the future.
The standard theory for explaining personal saving is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life-cycle</ENAMEX> model<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> The basic hypothesis is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save and
accumulate assets to smooth out their consumption and standard of
living over their lifetimes.
9A complementary theory of personal saving is the
permanent-income hypothesis. Generally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save a greater share
of income when their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> income is higher than their expected
long-run permanent income and save a smaller share when their
income is lower than the expected long-run level.

Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>, anticipating that their
incomes will increase over their careers, save little and may
borrow to finance current spending. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> in their peak earning
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> save to repay past borrowing and to accumulate assets for
retirement. The life-cycle model predicts that saving is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hump</ENAMEX>-shaped by age so that wealth accumulation peaks just before
retirement. Upon leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>, the elderly run down their
wealth-or "dissave." In saving for retirement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
theoretically take into account not only their expected retirement
age and the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> they expect to live in retirement but
also project their expected income, real returns on assets
accumulated, and inflation over their lifetime.
Although providing for retirement is a powerful motive for
saving, the life-cycle model in its simplest form cannot fully
explain how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> decide to save. Faced with the difficulty of
reconciling the standard life-cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with available empirical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have examined other motives that may help explain
saving behavior. While some evidence supports each motive,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> do not have a unified theory that fully explains how
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> choose to save<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.10</NUMEX> In general, the other major incentives or
reasons why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save are categorized as follows:


•
Precautionary saving motive. This is saving to protect
against unexpected expenses or possible emergencies, such as
unemployment or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who face
greater uncertainty about their income and those who are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">risk-averse</ENAMEX> may tend to save more for a "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rainy day</TIMEX>." Precautionary
saving may be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over-and-</NUMEX>above basic life-cycle saving for
retirement. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may choose to save enough to maintain a
buffer-stock or contingency reserve during their early working
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and defer retirement saving until their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40s</NUMEX> or
50s.11


•
Bequest saving motive. This is saving beyond basic
life-cycle saving for retirement. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may choose to save
more in order to bequeath the accumulated wealth to future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. The desire to leave a bequest may explain why the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> do not fully deplete their wealth and some even continue to
save during retirement. To some

retirement and precautionary saving.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">•</ENAMEX>"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big</ENAMEX> ticket" saving motive. This is relatively short-term
saving to accommodate a mismatch between current income and
expenses during the life-cycle. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save to pay for
big-ticket items such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, other consumer durables, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacations</ENAMEX>. Some must save in advance because they cannot borrow,
while others may prefer to save and avoid borrowing. Another big
ticket is the down payment to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> largely borrow
to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and later save by repaying their mortgages. Paying for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postsecondary</ENAMEX> education is a big ticket above and beyond life-cycle
saving for retirement.
Given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save for different purposes, increasing the
rate of return on saving does not necessarily motivate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
save more. A higher rate of return has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> opposing effects on
personal saving. On the one hand, a higher rate of return may
encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to save more because future spending becomes less
costly relative to spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>-the substitution effect. On the
other hand, given a higher rate of return, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need to save less
now to finance a given level of future consumption. This reduced
incentive to save as real rates of return increase is called the
income effect<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX> How <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> react to an increase in the rate of
return depends not only on their preferences about spending today
versus spending in the future but also on the real after-tax rate
of return-that is, the rate expected after taking into account
inflation and taxes<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>
Not everyone behaves like a life-cycle saver. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> plan
over shorter horizons-a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few years</TIMEX> or even paycheck-to-paycheck.
Instead of trying to forecast lifetime income and economic
conditions in the distant future, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may use simple rules of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thumb</ENAMEX>, such as saving a fixed share of their income or avoiding
debt<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.14</NUMEX> Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are "target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX>" who aim for a fixed level
of wealth or ratio of wealth to income in order to achieve

specific goals such as retirement, college education, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>,
or a vacation. Once target <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX> reach their wealth target, they
may feel no need to save more. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> may use mental
accounts-and even separate bank accounts-to earmark the money saved
for different uses. To ensure saving discipline, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may use
"contractual" or automatic mechanisms, such as payroll deductions,
to save. A mortgage is a key form of contractual saving in which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowner</ENAMEX>'s commitment to repay the principal borrowed compels
future saving.
Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have various theories to explain why
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> choose to save, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not save at all<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Low-income</ENAMEX>
and even some moderate-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> may feel that they are

impatient and they may discount the future so heavily that

spending.

Despite a great deal of study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have found no single

retirement effect. In a sense, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> makes retirement an
attainable goal and thus can prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to plan for
retirement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> may save more than they would have otherwise to
supplement their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits with additional
retirement income or because they want to retire before they are
eligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> benefits. Nevertheless,
some evidence suggests that the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> may
have reduced personal saving, and numerous studies have attempted
to estimate the saving offset<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX> However, given that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, it seems
unlikely that these programs were major contributors to the decline
in the personal saving rate over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s and 1990s</TIMEX>.

Credit availability. Improved access to credit reduces
the need to save before big-ticket purchases. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 20</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, credit cards have become widely available, and a smaller
down payment is needed to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. Easier access to credit may
have contributed somewhat to the saving decline. The ability to
borrow together with a rise in the number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-earner <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
may have reduced the perceived need for precautionary
saving.


17Means-tested government programs, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>, also may
affect the incentive to save. For example, requirements specifying
low levels of financial assets in order to qualify for government
benefits may discourage personal saving.
18Employer-sponsored pension plans also affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>'
incentives to save for retirement on their own. As noted above,
employer pension contributions as well as pension funds' interest
and dividend income are part of NIPA personal income and
saving.

Q1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is the Relationship Between</ENAMEX>
Personal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saving and Wealth</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">• Expectations</ENAMEX> about future income and wealth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> decide how
much to save based not only on their current income but also on
their expectations about their future lifetime income and wealth.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1991</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has enjoyed its longest postwar
economic expansion-unemployment and inflation have remained
relatively low and stable, and the stock market has achieved record
highs. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, the booming economy and stock market may
have lulled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into a sense of complacency that good times were
here to stay. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> may have saved less because they were
confident about future income prospects, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> were
wealthier because of gains on their existing assets. As discussed
below in question <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>, increased household wealth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>
appears to have contributed to the plunge in the personal saving
rate over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX>.
A1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX>. That <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> save little but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> are wealthier is
a paradox that can be confusing. It is widely known that saving
from current income is the way to accumulate assets and repay past
borrowing, thus increasing net worth. The flow of saving is
essential to accumulating a stock of wealth-as a general rule
someone who never saves will have no wealth<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conversely</ENAMEX>,
dissaving-spending more than current income-reduces the stock of
wealth because amounts saved in the past must be drawn down,
existing assets sold, or borrowing increased. Not only does saving
affect the stock of wealth, but wealth in turn influences the
choice to save.
Under the life-cycle model, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save to accumulate assets to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> future consumption, and attaining their wealth-to-income
target depends in part on the rate of return anticipated. Assets
accumulated can generate income in the form of interest and
dividends that in turn may be saved. Moreover, the change in net
worth not only includes the saving flow from current income but
also reflects changes in the market value of assets accumulated by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> generally agree that saving and wealth are
inversely related: increased wealth increases an individual's
ability to consume in the future and thus reduces the incentive to
save from current income. In other words, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' existing
assets increase in value, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less</NUMEX> from current income
and still achieve their wealth-income target. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>'
existing assets lose value, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have to save more to attain
their wealth-income target. While the idea of wealth
20A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonsaver</ENAMEX> could get lucky and receive an inheritance or win
the lottery.
targets may seem abstract to the average household, increased
wealth clearly influences personal saving through traditional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defined-benefit</ENAMEX> pension plans. For example, gains on existing
assets reduce the amount of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>'s contribution necessary to
fund its pension liability.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> shows that even as the personal saving rate has
fallen, the ratio of aggregate household net worth to disposable
personal income ("the wealth-income ratio") has risen in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Over most of the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' wealth-income
ratio did not fluctuate widely from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' aggregate wealth ranged from a
high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX> times <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' disposable income in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961 and 1996</TIMEX> to
a low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.3</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' wealthincome ratio
has increased rapidly-peaking at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.4</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. Although the surge in
household wealth contributed to the plunge in the personal saving
rate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> agree that increased wealth does
not fully explain the timing or magnitude of the decline over the
1980s and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990s</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Board of Governors</ENAMEX>.
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, aggregate household net worth doubled in nominal
terms. Moreover, the mix of assets held by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> has
changed dramatically. Traditionally, real estate has represented
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' largest asset; while the total value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>'
real estate holdings grew by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, real estate
steadily declined as a share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' total assets from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
percent in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. Meanwhile, the total value
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' stock holdings grew more than fourfold over the
1990s, and stocks as a share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' total assets increased
from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 percent</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1999.21</NUMEX>
As figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> shows, household wealth accumulation has swelled
relative to disposable personal income even as the flow of saving
from current income has dwindled. Recent research estimated that
the growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' aggregate net worth over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX> was roughly equally divided between
traditional saving and the increase in the nominal value of
existing assets. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX>, the increase in the
nominal value of existing assets was estimated to be about twice as
large as the flow from saving<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, nominal gains on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' assets-particularly financial assets-have dwarfed the
saving flow. For example, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, even though personal saving was
less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150 billion</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' wealth still grew by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.2</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trillion</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14 percent</NUMEX>).
As <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> learned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> when the stock market declined from
its peak value, what goes up can come down. Aggregate household
wealth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> declined for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time since data were
available in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>. According to the latest estimates, personal
saving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> was -<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8.5 billion</NUMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' wealth declined
by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $842 billion</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX>) largely as a result of the drop
in the market value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' stock holdings. The total value
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' stock holdings declined by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 18 percent</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, and stocks as a share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' total assets declined to
less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 percent</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Households</ENAMEX>' wealth-income ratio dropped from
its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> peak of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.9</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> but remains relatively high compared to the
1960s through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid 1990s</TIMEX>.
The basic life-cycle model of saving holds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
trying to smooth their standard of living over their lifetime.
Therefore, life-cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX>
21Households hold stocks directly as well as indirectly through
mutual funds, pension funds, life <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>, and trusts.

would not treat gains on existing assets as a windfall to spend
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The theory predicts that anticipated wealth changes would
not affect planned lifetime spending. Likewise, changes in wealth
perceived to be temporary due to fluctuating market values of
assets would not affect planned spending. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can
respond to an unexpected increase in wealth that they think will be
permanent by spending more of their current income. This change in
spending in response to a change in wealth is called the wealth
effect. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may tap their wealth by selling stocks or
borrowing against their home equity to boost current consumption.
The wealth effect can also work in the opposite direction. A
dramatic drop in household wealth-for example, due to an extended
downturn in the stock market-could eventually dampen household
consumption and lead to an increase in saving.
The increase in spending at any one time due to the wealth
effect would be expected to be small, given a life-cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">saver</ENAMEX>'s
tendency to spread consumption of a significant change in wealth
over time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> estimate that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">each dollar</NUMEX> in increased
wealth increases consumption by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few cents</NUMEX>. Estimates of the
wealth effect range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 to 7 cents</NUMEX>, and the typical estimate is
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 cents</NUMEX>. A recent study estimated that a wealth effect
of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 to 4 cents</NUMEX> could explain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fifths to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of the
decline in the personal saving rate since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1988.23</NUMEX>

Q1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Household Wealth Has Increased</ENAMEX>,
Does It Matter if the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Personal Saving Rate Has Declined</ENAMEX>?
A1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX>. With the personal saving rate around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or negative,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have questioned the relevance of the NIPA personal
saving measure<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.24</NUMEX> Wealth measures, which reflect the value of
existing assets based on current market conditions, show a
fundamentally different trend, as illustrated in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2.25</NUMEX>
Although these supplementary measures may explain why individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> may choose to save less, the NIPA personal saving rate
shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are consuming virtually all of their current
income and saving little for the future.
In evaluating the level of personal saving, it is important to
distinguish between saving as a source to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
capital formation and saving as a way for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> future consumption. A key difference between measuring the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s saving and gauging a household's finances is the treatment
of changes in the market value of existing assets. As discussed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 2</ENAMEX>, it is saving from current income-not gains on existing
assets-that is key to financing capital investment and increasing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capacity to produce goods and services. Although an
individual household can tap the increased value of its assets to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> additional consumption or accumulate other assets by
selling an asset to another household, the transaction itself
shifts ownership of the existing asset and does not generate new
economic output. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> as a whole may not be able to
consume and invest more<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moreover</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> may not be able
to simultaneously tap their apparent wealth to finance consumption
because large-scale asset sales could tend to depress market
values.
24To some extent, spending wealth-like spending income-drives
down the reported personal saving rate. As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q1.1</ENAMEX>,
realized gains do not count as personal income, but any taxes paid
on such gains reduce disposable personal income and thus saving. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> then spend a portion of their realized gains, this
spending further reduces the saving residual and the saving
rate.

of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' existing assets, see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William G. Gale</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>

26However, the sale of assets to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> can affect the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s ability to consume and invest.
Although the personal saving rate is low, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> do not
agree on whether this is a problem or whether private saving is
inadequate to finance domestic investment. On the one hand, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are concerned that low personal saving is undercutting
national saving and leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> more dependent on
foreign capital inflows to maintain domestic investment.27 On the
other hand, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have observed that strong consumer
spending-boosted by low saving and the wealth effect discussed
above-has fueled the surge in business investment and strong
economic growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>. Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> are concerned that individual households
are living beyond their means and some may have been counting on
continued high gains on their assets to finance future consumption.
If such expectations are not realized and, for example, there is a
sustained stock market downturn or an economic downturn, households
may have to scale back their consumption. This in turn could
potentially slow economic growth given that household spending
represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy. However, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> suggest that the risk of a collapse in household
spending that would hurt overall economic growth is exaggerated
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have greater resources than the personal saving
rate suggests. 28
Although the aggregate wealth-income ratio rose in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>,
wealth is fairly concentrated and not all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have
experienced gains in the stock market. To gauge the financial
situation of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> requires going beyond aggregate
household data. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Survey of Consumer Finances</ENAMEX> provides detailed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on family net worth and holdings of assets and liabilities<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX>
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> shows that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have accumulated little, if
any, net worth. As one might expect, high-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> typically
have accumulated more net worth than low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.

outside the financial mainstream and thus unlikely to be
saving.
The key to accumulating wealth for retirement is simply the
choice to save, although investment choices also matter. Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> choose to save over their working lives for retirement
while others choose to save little and spend more while working.
Recent research found that even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> with similar lifetime
earnings approach retirement with vastly different levels of
wealth<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX> Even though many low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have accumulated
no wealth as they approach retirement, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found that
some low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> had managed to accumulate fairly
sizeable wealth. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found that a significant
portion of higher-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> save little. Choices about
whether to invest, for example, in the stock market or in less
risky, lower-yielding assets such as a bank saving account also
make a difference. Regardless of income level, those households
that do not save much will have few assets on which to enjoy
gains.
A1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>. Traditionally, retirement income was characterized as a
"<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-legged stool" comprising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> pensions,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' own saving for retirement. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> benefits contributed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>'s cash
income. As figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> shows, saving, both through
employer-sponsored pension plans and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> on their own
behalf, provides a significant part of retirement income. Pension
benefits accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>'s cash income in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> and income from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' accumulated assets for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another 20</TIMEX>
percent. In addition, the elderly and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> may supplement
their retirement income by continuing to work. As shown in figure
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>, earnings from continued employment represent a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> leg on
the retirement-income stool.

Currently, many financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that they will
need to replace <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 70</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of their pre-retirement
income to maintain their pre-retirement living standard<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.32</NUMEX>
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
benefits currently replace <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 39 percent</NUMEX> of pre-retirement
income for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> with average wages (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$32,105</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). Given
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s progressive benefit formula, however, the
replacement rate varies by income. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> currently
replaces <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 53 percent</NUMEX> for low earners and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 24 percent</NUMEX> for
those who earned the taxable maximum (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$72,600</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX>
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> provides a foundation for retirement
income, pensions, income from accumulated assets, and current
earnings largely determine which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> will have the highest
retirement incomes, as figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> shows. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> makes up
over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of the retirement income for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (lowest) and
second income quintiles. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third and fourth quintiles</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> still serves as the most important source of retirement
income. For the highest quintile, pensions are a more significant
income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, but pensions represent a
smaller share for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than either income from accumulated
assets or earnings. It is important to note that these data reflect
in part the fact that pensions are not a universal source of
retirement income as is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 48 percent</NUMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> lacked pension income or annuities, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 53</NUMEX>
percent of those employed lacked a pension plan<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX>
32The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> rate can be calculated as a simple percentage
of pretax income. Or, the replacement rate considered to be
adequate can be computed in a more sophisticated way, netting out
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> taxes, other taxes, or working expenses that will
not be paid in retirement. Thus, desired or target replacement
rates can vary significantly depending on income level and other
factors.
33These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> rates are based on applying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benefit</ENAMEX> rules to hypothetical retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> who
had steady earning levels over their careers. The average earner
represents a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> who earned the average of covered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. The low earner earned <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 percent</NUMEX> of this
average. The maximum earner had earnings equal to the maximum
taxable amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>.

Personal saving now can contribute substantially to future
retirement income, as illustrated in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>. While most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> say they recognize the need to save for retirement, many
do not save in any systematic way. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Research</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> recently reported that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63 percent</NUMEX> of workers
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 25</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> replied that they did not own a
retirement saving account, such as an employer-sponsored 401(k) or
an individual retirement account (IRA)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> According to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>
Retirement Confidence Survey<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">,36 about 46 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have not tried to calculate how much they need to save for
retirement. The survey also found that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-particularly
those planning to work the longest-underestimate how long they will
live in retirement. Half of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> reaching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65</TIMEX> can expect to be
alive at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 82</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> reaching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65</TIMEX> can expect to be
alive at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 86</TIMEX>; some will live to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 100 and older</TIMEX>. Yet, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
percent of those surveyed expect their retirement will last for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> or less, and another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 percent</NUMEX> believe their retirement will
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last less than 20 years</TIMEX>. In addition, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are unaware that
the retirement age for full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits is gradually
rising from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65 to 67</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> do not agree on whether baby
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boomers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are saving enough for their
retirement<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX>
Research suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are not financially
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">literate</ENAMEX> tend to save less. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not appreciate that
saving even small amounts over time is the way to accumulate
wealth. According to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> opinion survey, low and moderate income
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> mistakenly believe they have a better chance of
accumulating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> through winning the lottery than through
saving and investing a portion of their income<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38 One</NUMEX> reason for
this mistaken notion is that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> dramatically
underestimate

the value of compounding-how money saved can grow over time<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.39</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> might begin to save more if they were aware how much they
need for retirement and that saving regularly over time is the key
to preserving their future standard of living.
A1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>. As we have reported, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> faces a demographic
tidal wave in the future that poses significant challenges for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, and our economy as a whole<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.40</NUMEX> More
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are living longer, and they will need more resources to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> more years of retirement. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly population</ENAMEX>-those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 65</TIMEX> and over-is growing and
accounts for an increasing share of the total population (see
figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>). As a share of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the elderly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> has grown from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.1 percent</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.4 percent</NUMEX> over the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 75 years</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly population</ENAMEX> share will nearly double to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.5 percent</NUMEX>,
according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Trustees</ENAMEX>' intermediate actuarial
projections<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.41</NUMEX> Although the babyboom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> will contribute
heavily to the growth of the elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, increasing life
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expectancy</ENAMEX> and declining fertility rates are also responsible for
the aging of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.42
39Compounding can be explained in terms of the "rule of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>." To
find out how fast an amount saved can double, divide the interest
rate into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX>. For example, at an interest rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX>
saved would double to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 14 years</TIMEX>. At a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
percent, it would take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 9 years</TIMEX> to double.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> now collects more in payroll taxes than it pays in
benefits, but just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years from now</TIMEX> this will be reversed, as
shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>. Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2016</TIMEX>, the program faces cash
deficits as benefit payments are projected to outpace cash revenue.
Absent meaningful reform, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> trust fund will be
exhausted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2038</TIMEX>, and projected tax revenue would be adequate to
pay for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 73 percent</NUMEX> of projected benefits thereafter.

The long-term outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> is much bleaker. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s
financial status has generally been gauged by the financial
solvency of the Part A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Insurance</ENAMEX> (HI) trust fund, which
primarily covers inpatient hospital care and is financed by payroll
taxes. As shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> trust fund faces cash
deficits beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2016</TIMEX>, and the trust fund will be depleted in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2029</TIMEX>. These HI projections do not reflect the growing cost of the
Part B <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Medical Insurance</ENAMEX> (SMI) component of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>,
which covers outpatient services and is financed through general
revenues and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> premiums. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX> accounts for somewhat more
than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of Medicare spending and is expected to account for
a growing share of total program dollars. As with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending will swell as the elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> increases.
Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> costs are expected to increase faster than the
rest of the economy. Projected growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> reflects the
escalation of health care costs at rates well exceeding general
rates of inflation. Increases in the number and quality of health
care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> have been fueled by the explosive growth of medical
technology.

Although public attention focuses on the trust fund insolvency
dates, the effect of financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> will be
felt sooner as the baby boom generation begins to retire. As shown
in figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare HI</ENAMEX> cash
deficits are expected to grow substantially in the near future.
Regardless of whether the trust funds are relying on interest
income or drawing down their balances to pay benefits, the
government as a whole must come up with the cash by reducing
overall budget surpluses, borrowing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, increasing
other taxes, or reducing spending for other programs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX>
Without reform, the combined financial burden of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> on future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> becomes unsustainable. As figure
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.10</NUMEX> shows, the cost of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> programs combined would nearly
double as a share of the payroll tax base over the long term.
Assuming no other changes, these programs would constitute a
substantial drain on the earnings of our future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.

Personal saving plays a dual role in bolstering retirement
security for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, assets accumulated
by saving provide a key source of retirement income (see Q1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>).
Those who do not save and who do not have pensions will have to
depend largely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> in their old age. According to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2001 Retirement</ENAMEX> Confidence Survey, many

example, affects federal government saving and national saving.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are not confident that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 percent</NUMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 percent</NUMEX>) will continue to provide benefits equivalent
to those received <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Anticipating potential benefit cuts,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could save more now to supplement their future retirement
income and to cushion against future health care costs or they
could choose to work longer and delay retirement. Alternatively,
they might not save more or work longer, and they would experience
a lower standard of living in retirement.
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, personal saving provides resources vital to
enhancing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s productive capacity. Saving more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, in
turn, can improve the outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>. As
discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 3</ENAMEX>, higher saving and investment can boost
worker productivity and lead to greater economic growth. A larger
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> would mean higher real wages for future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and in turn
more payroll taxes to finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>. With an
aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and a slowly growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>, increasing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s future economic capacity is critical to ensuring

<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 2</ENAMEX>
National Saving Overview
Q2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is National Saving and How Is</ENAMEX>
It Measured?
A2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. Just as for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, saving for the national economy is the
act of setting some of current income aside for the future instead
of spending it for current consumption. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX>, saving is measured
as current income less current consumption expenditures. National
saving is the sum of saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and all
levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> (federal, state, and local). For the economy
as a whole, national saving is the portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s income
not used for private and public consumption. The sum of national
saving and saving borrowed from abroad represents the total amount
of resources available for investment, that is, the purchase of
capital goods-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, equipment, software, houses<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX> and
inventories-by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.2 Saving and investing
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s stock of capital goods to be used in
the future-the capital stock- and thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capacity to
produce goods and services in the future.
National saving is measured in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways-gross national saving or
net national saving. Gross national saving is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s total
income minus its consumption and represents resources available for
domestic or foreign investment. Some portion of gross national
saving pays for replacing capital goods that have been worn out or
used up in producing goods and services-consumption of fixed
capital in technical terms, or hereafter simply depreciation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> The
other portion of gross national saving, which is used to add to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s stock of capital goods, is net national saving. Net
national saving is the measure commonly used to gauge whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s capacity to produce goods and services in the future is
increasing or decreasing.
By itself, the dollar amount of national saving is not a
particularly meaningful indicator of the portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
income that is not consumed. National saving is usually expressed
as a share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
1Investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>-occupied residential property is defined as
business investment.
2This represents the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> definition of investment used
throughout this primer unless otherwise stated. Other ways of
thinking about national saving and investment are discussed in Q2.4
and in sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX>.

current income-or its economic output<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> Because the primary
measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s economic output is gross domestic product
(GDP), saving is often shown as a percent of GDP. Text box <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>
compares GDP to another measure of economic output-gross national
product (GNP). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, gross national saving as a share of GDP was
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.3 percent</NUMEX>. After subtracting depreciation, which was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.6</NUMEX>
percent of GDP, net national saving was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.7 percent</NUMEX> of GDP.

GDP is the output of goods and services produced by labor and
property located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, while GNP is the output of
goods and services produced by labor and property supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
residents, regardless of where they are located. The difference
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> GDP and GNP is income receipts from the goods and services
produced abroad using labor and capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> less
income payments for the goods and services produced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> using labor and capital supplied by foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
Because both GNP and national saving include these income receipts,
net of payments, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Economic Analysis</ENAMEX> (BEA) presents
national saving as a share of GNP. However, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BEA</ENAMEX> has
featured GDP as the primary measure of economic activity because
GDP is consistent in coverage with indicators such as domestic
investment and productivity. GDP is also the measure cited in
economic trend analyses and for cross-country comparisons by many,
including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Council of Economic Advisers</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization for Economic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperation and Development</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OECD</ENAMEX>). Because this report deals not
only with national saving but also with other measures such as
investment and the federal budget position, we express saving,
investment, and federal government spending as a share of GDP.
Expressing all of our analysis as a share of GDP provides a
consistent frame of reference for comparing economywide shares for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and for comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> saving rates to those of
other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the difference between GDP and GNP is
small. For example, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, GDP was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9,963 billion</NUMEX> and GNP was
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9,959 billion</NUMEX>.b Given the relatively small difference between the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures, the denominator has little effect on calculating
saving as a share of the economy. Regardless of which measure is
used, saving as a share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.3 percent</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.

bIn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, GNP was less than GDP because income receipts from the

world.
4The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s income is the sum of all the payments made to
those who produce output. This income equals the total spending on
the economy's output of goods and services; thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
income and output are the same.

Q2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>. How Has <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">U.S. National Saving Changed</ENAMEX>
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>- Both Overall and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Component</ENAMEX>?
Gross national saving is a good indicator of resources available
both to
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) replace old, worn-out capital goods with new, and sometimes
more productive, goods and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) expand the capital stock.5 The share
of gross national saving used to replace depreciated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> has
increased over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 40 years</TIMEX>. This increase in depreciation
reflects a shift in the capital stock's composition from long-lived
assets with relatively low depreciation rates, like steel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX>, to
shorter-lived assets such as computers and software. Even if gross
national saving were only sufficient to replace depreciated
capital, the economy could grow to some extent because replacing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worn-out</ENAMEX> and used capital with new equipment tends to bring
improved technology into the production process. Nevertheless,
national saving beyond the amount necessary to replace depreciated
capital goods is important for increasing the overall size of the
capital stock and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s future productive capacity.
A2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>. As figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> shows, gross national saving rebounded from
a low of


15.6
percent of GDP during the saving slump of the early 1990s
to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.3 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. This rebound is due primarily to increased
government saving that has more than made up for the decline in
personal saving described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1</ENAMEX>. However, despite this
rebound, national saving as a share of GDP is still below the level
of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">-an</ENAMEX> era characterized by high saving and rapid growth
in productivity and living standards, defined in terms of GDP per
capita. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, depreciation as a share of GDP has
increased slightly (see Q2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>), and net national saving as a share
of GDP has declined more than gross national saving. Net national
saving rose from


3.4
percent of GDP in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.7 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> but remains
well below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.9 percent</NUMEX>.


5As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 3</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> can use some of its saving
to invest abroad and can also borrow from abroad to finance
domestic investment.

Analysis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Commerce</ENAMEX>.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> breaks net national saving down into components. It
shows both the aggregate trend and how saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> affected net national saving. As
discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1</ENAMEX>, personal saving is the amount of aggregate
disposable personal income left over after personal spending on
goods and services.6 Personal saving averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.7 percent</NUMEX> of GDP in
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX> and increased to an average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 7 percent</NUMEX> over the
1970s and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>, however, personal saving
has steadily declined to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-0.1 percent</NUMEX> of GDP in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>-the lowest
point in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 65 years</TIMEX>.
6NIPA personal saving is measured net of depreciation on fixed
assets owned by unincorporated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and owner-occupied
residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX>. Because household purchases of residential
dwellings are treated as business investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX>, the
depreciation on these assets is included in gross business
saving.

Personal and business saving together make up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
private saving. Business saving reflects the earnings retained by
businesses after paying taxes and dividends. These retained
earnings are available to finance investment. For business saving,
it is important to distinguish between net and gross saving. On a
gross basis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> have been the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX> in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 70 percent</NUMEX> of gross national saving in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. However, given that a large portion of business saving is
used to replace capital goods worn out or used in the production
process, business saving net of depreciation is a smaller
share-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 47 percent</NUMEX>-of net national saving. As shown in figure
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>, net business saving has averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 3 percent</NUMEX> of GDP from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960 to 2000</TIMEX>.
Government saving arises when federal, state, and local
government revenue exceeds current expenditures. Government saving,
also called a surplus, adds to the pool of national saving
available to finance investment and allows a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to reduce
its outstanding debt or purchase nongovernment assets. Conversely,
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissaving</ENAMEX>, or a deficit, absorbs funds saved by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and reduces overall national saving
available to finance private investments. To finance a deficit, a
government has to borrow or sell assets it owns. State and local
government net saving has been relatively small, ranging from a
surplus of
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.1 percent</NUMEX> of GDP in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> to a deficit of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1 percent</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>.
The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s effect on net national saving has
varied widely over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 40 years</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of the 1960s</TIMEX>, the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was a net saver. However, the federal government
ran large deficits through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">much of the 1980s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>, which
reduced the overall level of national saving in the economy.
Federal deficits averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.4 percent</NUMEX> of GDP in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> and
reached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.7 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992 and 1993</TIMEX>, federal deficits
absorbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of private saving. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, deficit
reduction initiatives and economic growth have reduced federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissaving</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1998 through 2000</TIMEX>, the federal government achieved
surpluses, shifting from being a drain on net national saving to
become a contributor to it. These surpluses also allowed the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to reduce its outstanding debt held by the
public.7 Section 4 discusses in more detail how federal fiscal
policy affects national saving.
Despite this recent shift in the federal position, net national
saving as a share of GDP remains well below the average level of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> largely as a result of the decline in personal saving.
Traditionally, personal saving had been a key source of net
national saving available for new investment. Whereas personal
saving represented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of average

8When federal dissaving peaked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, personal saving as a
share of GDP was nearly double net national saving as a share of
GDP. In a sense, government dissaving consumed much of the personal
saving, leaving relatively little to finance private
investment.

It is not surprising that national saving varies across
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. The increased output resulting from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> level of
saving and investment depends on the investment choices available
and selected in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. In addition, national saving may vary
across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> due to differences in the price of capital goods,
income levels, growth rates, economic and social policies,
demographics, and even culture. For example, recent research
suggests that capital goods are relatively cheaper in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> than in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, which means it takes less saving to

As figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> shows, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s gross national saving as a share of

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s high saving rate has been attributed to several factors

software as investment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> Because saving equals investment in
the economy-a national income accounting identity-reclassifying
software as investment not only raised the measure of investment
but also raised the measure of gross saving and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
total output.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> measurement has evolved, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s human
capital and knowledge-also forms of intangible capital-are not part
of the NIPA definitions of investment and saving. This means that,
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NIPA</ENAMEX>, business computer purchases count as saving and
investment, but spending to train <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to use the new computers
counts as current consumption rather than investment. Many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> agree that spending both on education and on general
research and development (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX>) enhances future economic
capacity and, conceptually, should be considered investment.
Nonetheless, broadening the NIPA investment definition to include
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> would be difficult because there is no
consensus on which expenditures should be included or how to
measure the depreciation and contribution to output of intangible
capital. Although counting education and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R&D</ENAMEX> as investment
would raise the measured level of investment, this broader measure
of investment has also experienced a downward trend. Federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> estimated that, as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
investment including education and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R&D</ENAMEX> had declined as a share
of GDP since the 1970s.14
A more controversial measure of personal saving would include
changes in the value of existing assets<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.15</NUMEX> Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> focuses on
the current production of goods and services and on the income
arising from that production, NIPA income and saving do not reflect
changes in the value of existing tangible and financial assets,
such as land, stocks, or bonds. As discussed

15Whether changes in the market value of existing assets should

in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> generally agree that wealth-based
measures that reflect changes in the value of existing assets are
useful for gauging individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' finances and retirement
preparations. However, it is uncertain whether wealth-based
measures are reliable for gauging the growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
capital stock and whether revaluation of existing assets should
count as saving for society as a whole. Some portion of the change
in the market value of existing assets may reflect increased
productive capacity and thus could represent income and saving, but
it is difficult to isolate that portion<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX> Most gains and losses
from transferring assets within and between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> "wash out" at
the national level and may not represent newly available resources
for the economy as a whole<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX> For example, when one household sells
an appreciated asset to another household, any gain realized may be
used to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX>'s consumption, but the transaction does
not increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s income or output. Moreover, the market
value of financial assets is often volatile and may not reflect a
real, permanent change in the productive potential of the
underlying capital assets. Lastly, some of the increased market
value of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' stock holdings may stem from the use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>' retained earnings for investment, which is already
reflected in NIPA saving and investment.
16An asset's market value can change as a result of changes in
tax treatment; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>' perceptions of risk; taste; or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' expectations of future economic capacity arising from,
for example, the introduction of new technology. Only the last
source, however, may relate to the asset's productive capacity.
17However, gains and losses arising from sale of assets to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> do not "wash out" and could affect national consumption
and investment.

National Saving and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economy</ENAMEX>
Q3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Does National Saving Contribute</ENAMEX>
to Investment and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately Economic Growth</ENAMEX>?
A3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. National saving provides the resources for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> to
invest domestically and abroad. Domestic investment in new
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> and equipment can boost productivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. Increased worker productivity, in turn, leads to higher
real wages and greater economic growth over the long term. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
investment abroad does not add to the domestic capital stock used
by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to produce goods and services. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> investment
abroad does increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s wealth and will generate income
adding to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> GNP. When national saving is lower than domestic
investment, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> can borrow from foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX> to make up the
difference<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> The resulting increase in domestic capital would
enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s productivity and wages, but the payments to
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX> flow abroad. In general, saving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> increases a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s capacity to produce more goods and services and generate
higher income in the future. Increased economic capacity and rising
incomes will be crucial as the population ages because a relatively
smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> will bear the burden of financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> while also seeking to maintain its own standard of
living.
Saving entails a tradeoff because it requires consuming less now
in exchange for consuming more later. While those who sacrifice to
save now can themselves enjoy higher consumption in the future,
some of the resulting increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital stock and
the related income will also benefit future generations. Thus,
current saving and investment decisions have profound implications
for the level of wellbeing in the future, and current generations
are in a sense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stewards</ENAMEX> of the economy on behalf of future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> is a flow chart illustrating saving's central role in
providing resources to invest in the capital needed to produce the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s goods and services. In this simplified depiction of the
production process, capital and labor are the basic inputs used to
produce goods and services. The resources used for domestic
investment come from saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and all
levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. In addition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> can invest more in
domestic capital than it saves by borrowing from other
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
1When foreign investment in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> exceeds that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
investment abroad, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s net foreign investment will be
negative. Q3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> discusses the extent to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has

The amount of goods and services produced depends not only on
the amount of capital and labor but also on how efficiently these
inputs are used. This is called total factor productivity. Total
factor productivity is the portion of output not explained by the
use of capital and labor and is generally associated with the level
of technology and managerial efficiency<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX>, training, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> also can potentially increase output; in this simplified
flow chart, these would influence total factor
2The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Labor Statistics</ENAMEX> (BLS) publishes an official
measure of output per unit of combined labor and capital
inputs-multifactor productivity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLS</ENAMEX>' measure of labor input not
only takes into account changes in the size of the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, but
also changes in its composition as measured by education and work

service flow rather than price or value. For more information on

productivity. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s total output of goods and services, or
its GDP, is a function of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> worked, the capital stock, and
total factor productivity. Adding the net income payments received
from the rest of the world (which can be negative) to GDP yields
the gross national income, or GNP. A portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
income, in turn, is saved, allowing for additional investment in
domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, equipment, and other forms of capital that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> use to produce more goods and services or for investment
abroad.
Investment in the capital stock is a principal source of growth
in labor productivity, or output per hour worked<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.3</TIMEX> Through its
influence on real wages, labor productivity is the fundamental
determinant of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s standard of living. Minimum levels of
investment in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s physical and human capital are crucial
just to maintain labor productivity and living standards. Equipment
that wears out must be replaced; younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> entering the labor
force need to be trained in skills to replace older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> as they
retire. Even as the population ages, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> itself
will continue growing-although slowly, with annual growth in
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">aggregate hours</TIMEX> worked averaging <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 0.1 percent</NUMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20204</NUMEX>-and
the demand for capital goods is likely to increase. Not only must
capital goods be replaced as they depreciate, but new generations
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> must be comparably
3According to neoclassical growth theory, the rate of growth of
labor productivity depends on the growth rate in the capital-labor
ratio, weighted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>'s share and the growth rate of total
factor productivity. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Solow</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Change</ENAMEX> in the

trained and equipped (capital widening)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> Otherwise, output per
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> and living standards may fall.
Beyond the minimum level of investment needed to maintain the
capital stock, additional investment to expand the capital stock is
an important way to increase labor productivity, and thus future
living standards. With the retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> projected to swell
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, investment in new capital is an important way to raise
the productivity of the slowly growing labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. Investment
boosts labor productivity because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> can produce <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more per hour</NUMEX>
when they have more and better equipment and better skills (capital
deepening). The essence of this point can be illustrated with a
simple example. Consider the transformation of ditch-digging from a
relatively slow and somewhat imprecise process involving several
ordinary shovels, much labor effort, and low skill levels to a
faster and more precise process often involving a single power
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">digger</ENAMEX> controlled by a skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>. The elements of this
example, repeated across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of individual tasks, encapsulates
the difference between an advanced industrial economy with a high
standard of living and a less developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with a low standard
of living.
Growth in output per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> also depends on total factor
productivity growth. A higher rate of technological change and
improved efficiency in using labor and capital can boost GDP and
thus future living standards. Even if there were no net
investment-that is, if gross investment were only enough to replace
depreciated capital-the economy could grow to some extent because
the new capital tends to embody improved technology. However, there
is no agreement on how to raise total factor productivity. Spending
on education and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> is thought to help because
5While the aging of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is a commonly voiced argument
for raising national saving, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> maintain that the
projected decline in labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> growth will increase the
capital-labor ratio and reduce the return to capital while raising
the productivity of labor. They conclude that, under some
circumstances, saving should actually decline slightly in response
to population aging. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> point out, however, that if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> is operating below the optimal saving rate, saving can rise
without overly depressing market rates of return and, therefore,
provide significant improvement to future incomes. In addition,
saving can be invested abroad without lowering the global rate of
return. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas W. Elmendorf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise M. Sheiner</ENAMEX>, "Should

A3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>. Although national saving as a share of GDP remains below
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> average, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> GDP growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> reached levels
similar to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.2 percent</NUMEX>. After slowing to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>
percent over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX> and further to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2.4 percent</NUMEX> in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> GDP growth accelerated to an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX>
percent from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995 to 2000</TIMEX>. This higher growth stemmed, in part,
from the rebound in national saving that was largely attributable
to federal deficit reduction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was also able to borrow from
abroad to help finance domestic investment, as discussed further
below. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> domestic investment trends helped promote
growth in GDP and living standards: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the price of investment
goods declined relative to other goods and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) investment in
high-yielding information technology has risen rapidly. Thus, even
though saving as a share of the economy has been low by historical
standards, economic growth has been high because more and better
investments were made.
A dollar of saving buys more investment goods now than in the
past because the price of investment goods has decreased relative
to other goods in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1995 to 2000</TIMEX>, the price index
for nonresidential investment goods declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 percent</NUMEX> per year
on average, while overall prices as measured by the GDP price index
rose, albeit at a modest annual rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.8 percent</NUMEX>. The major
source of the overall decline in investment-good prices was the
over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 percent</NUMEX> average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> decline in the price of computers
and peripheral equipment since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. In other words, in each

more computing power on average than it did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>.6

Not only has <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">each dollar</NUMEX> of saving bought more investment goods
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, but a greater share of that dollar was invested in
information technology, including computers, software, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> equipment. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1990 to 2000</TIMEX>, the share of business
fixed investment devoted to information equipment and software rose
from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 28 percent to 39 percent</NUMEX>.
The increasing share of investment going to information
processing equipment and software helped boost overall economic
growth over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> because information technology has appeared
to be highly productive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>. This is true even though
rapid depreciation and obsolescence characterize information
technology. For example, computers and related equipment have an
estimated annual depreciation rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 percent,7</NUMEX> and new versions
of software applications are released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every few years</TIMEX>. Hence, for
investment in information technology to be profitable, its gross
rate of return must be quite high. Its high rate of return combined
with its increasing share of total investment meant that
information technology has been a major contributor to the rapid
economic growth since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. Indeed, recent economic research
suggests that investment in information technology explains most of
the acceleration in labor productivity growth-a major component of
overall economic growth-since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995.8 From 1995 to 2000</TIMEX>, labor
productivity growth averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 percent</NUMEX> per year compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>

9Because of difficulties in measuring productivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> and
nonmarket activities, the most widely used measure of labor
productivity growth is the rate of increase in nonfarm business
sector output per hour worked.
Economic research suggests investment in information technology
also may have led to faster growth in total factor productivity
since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1995.10</NUMEX> As noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, total factor productivity growth
reflects technological change and new and better ways of organizing
production. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Firms</ENAMEX> producing computers and semiconductors have
achieved substantial operating efficiencies and high rates of
return on capital investments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, despite a large
expansion in their capital stock. These high rates of return seem
to contradict <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>' general expectations that increasing the
supply of capital reduces its return and thus seems to indicate a
rise in total factor productivity. Although total factor
productivity growth appears to have risen, the pace of growth may
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decelerate</ENAMEX>. Technological advances generally come in waves that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crest</ENAMEX> and eventually subside.
Abundant saving alone does not always generate robust growth
because the saving must also be invested well. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s economy over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> demonstrated that high saving can coincide with economic
stagnation. Among the reasons offered for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s lengthy slowdown
is poor investment choices due in part to its less developed
financial markets in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX> had fewer options and were left
with low returns. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s role both in investing in
physical infrastructure and in allocating capital to industrial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> at preferential rates also resulted in many low-yielding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">investments</ENAMEX>. Finally, with its high postwar investment levels,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>'s production processes became more capital intensive compared
to most other advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. With this greater capital
intensity, diminishing returns to capital have reduced the return
on investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>
10However, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> are concerned that the acceleration
may be concentrated in durable manufacturing rather than widely
disseminated throughout the economy. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Gordon</ENAMEX>, "Does

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Supplemented Its Saving and Investment by Borrowing Saving From</ENAMEX>
Abroad? How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Does Such Borrowing Affect the Economy</ENAMEX>?
A3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>. An economy that is not open to international trade and
investment must rely solely on its own saving to provide the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, equipment, and other forms of
capital. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> in an
open economy such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> can finance the gap between
domestic investment and national saving with foreign investment in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In essence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy can borrow the
saving of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to finance more investment than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
national saving would permit. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX> shows the difference
between domestic investment and national saving, which is defined
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> as net foreign investment. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most of the 1980s</TIMEX> and
1990s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was able to invest more than it saved by attracting
financing from abroad. This means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has been a
net borrower of saving from other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>.

When the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> runs a trade deficit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> buy less
than a dollar's worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> goods and services with every dollar
they earn on their exports sold to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. They
generally invest those excess dollars in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> assets. Their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">willingness to acquire U.S. assets</ENAMEX> -i.e., to lend to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>- allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to run trade deficits. In
fact,


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> deficits may be as much due to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>'
willingness to acquire


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
assets as to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> desire to acquire foreign goods and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>.


While using foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>' saving allows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> domestic
investment to exceed national saving, these financial inflows have
implications for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s economic growth and for future living
standards. This effect depends in part on how the borrowed funds
are used. To the extent that borrowing from abroad finances
domestic investment, the foreign borrowing adds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
capital stock and boosts productive capacity. This augments future
income, although a portion of the income generated by the
investment will be paid to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX>. However, if the
borrowing from abroad is used to finance consumption, short-term
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wellbeing</ENAMEX> is improved but the ability to repay the borrowing in the
future will not be enhanced. In this respect, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> experience in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1990s</ENAMEX> differs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that of the 1980s</TIMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, mounting
federal deficits and the decline in personal saving reduced the
supply of national saving available for investment. Although
borrowing from abroad helped finance additional investment,
consumption rose more than domestic investment during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. In
contrast, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> there has been an upward trend in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
national saving while domestic investment has surged. Borrowing
from abroad has allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to overcome its saving
shortfall and take advantage of productive investment
opportunities. The increased investment has contributed to higher
GDP growth in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, and the stronger economy should help in
servicing the debt owed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>.
Persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> current account deficits have translated into a

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> and policymakers are concerned about whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> can continue to increase its reliance on foreign
capital inflows. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investors</ENAMEX> generally try to achieve some balance in
the allocation of their portfolios, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> assets already
represent a significant share of foreign portfolios. Although the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of global GDP, it received
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the saving exported by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> with current account
surpluses in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1999.15</NUMEX> Given this, it may not be realistic to expect
ever-increasing foreign investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, as has
been the case in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>. Net foreign investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> might even decrease from the recent high rates if foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> find more attractive opportunities elsewhere. Over the
long term, many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> currently financing investment in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> will themselves be confronted with aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>
and declining national saving. Thus, continuing to rely on foreign
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX> to finance such a large share of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> domestic investment
is not a viable strategy over the long run.
If the net inflow of foreign investment were to diminish, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> would no longer be able to invest so much more in the
domestic capital stock than it saves. Although a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> can run
current account deficits for extended periods of time, a low level
of national saving implies a low level of domestic investment over
the long run. According to recent empirical research, current
account deficits eventually have been followed by periods of
declining investment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX> Rather than forgo domestic investment
opportunities that would enhance the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s future standard of
living, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> could increase national saving. Any

A3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>. The current long-term economic outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> national
saving and investment is subject to wide ranging uncertainty about
economic changes and the responses to those changes. However, one
certainty is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is aging and there will be
fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> supporting each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retiree</ENAMEX>. This demographic shift is
expected to cause a decline in economic growth rates when labor
force growth slows after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. Moreover, the aging of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> may exert negative pressure on national saving. As
discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tend to draw down their assets in
their retirement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. As government spending on health and
retirement programs for the growing elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> swells,
government saving is also likely to decline. Q4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> examines the
long-term outlook for federal government saving/dissaving.
To get a sense of the long-term implications of alternative
national saving paths, we examined the economic outlook over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 75 years</TIMEX> under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different assumptions: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) gross national
saving remains constant at its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> share of GDP-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.3 percent</NUMEX>-and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) gross national saving varies depending on how much the federal
government saves<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18 One</NUMEX> possible fiscal policy, which we used in
our simulation, would be for the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to save only
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses and to spend the non−Social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses projected over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 10 years</TIMEX> on some mix of
permanent tax cuts and spending increases. For simplicity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Save</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Surpluses</ENAMEX> simulation assumes that saving by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> remains
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX> as a share of
17The current account balance would improve to the extent that
the increase in saving is used to increase net foreign investment
rather than domestic investment. Research suggests that for each
additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> of saving, perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> is used to increase
net foreign investment and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> is used to increase domestic
investment. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Feldstein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Bacchetta</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>

18Long-term simulations are useful for comparing the potential
outcome of alternative national saving paths within a common
economic framework. Such simulations can illustrate the long-term
economic consequences of saving choices that are made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simulations</ENAMEX> should not be viewed as forecasts of economic outcomes
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 or 75 years</TIMEX> in the future. Rather, they should be seen only as
illustrations of the economic outcomes associated with alternative
saving paths based on common demographic and economic assumptions.

GDP at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.1 percent</NUMEX>-average nonfederal saving as a share of GDP
since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1998.19</NUMEX> As figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> shows, gross national saving as a share
of GDP remains fairly steady over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Save</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, as spending
for health and retirement programs mounts, dissaving by the federal
government begins crowding out other saving, and national saving
begins to decline. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2024</TIMEX>, gross national saving as a share of GDP
drops below the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">mid 15 percent</NUMEX> range experienced during the saving
slump in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2042</TIMEX>, gross national saving would
plunge below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX>-lower than during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Depression</ENAMEX>.
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX>, gross
national saving eventually disappears, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> begins
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissaving</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2047</TIMEX>.
19The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year</TIMEX> period coincides with federal surpluses and its use
avoids extending the unusually low nonfederal saving rate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
throughout the simulation period.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX> is not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sustainable</ENAMEX>, but it is useful for illustrative purposes.
Ultimately, this would be a doomsday scenario for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy.
National saving would be inadequate to finance even the investment
necessary to maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital stock. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> shows
that, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital stock eroded, future living
standards-measured in terms of GDP per capita-inevitably would
fall. However, before such catastrophic effects, low national
saving would probably result in higher interest rates, rising
inflation, and the increasing reluctance of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to
lend to a weakening <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy. These more immediate consequences
would force action before national saving plunged to the levels
shown in the simulation. The simulation is not a prediction of what
will happen in the future. Rather, it serves as a warning that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> must both save more in the near term and reform
entitlement programs for the elderly to put the budget on a more
sustainable footing for the long term.

Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> is not solely a warning. It also illustrates how
saving more would improve the long-term economic outlook. Just as
we enjoy a higher living standard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> than our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> did,
future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> will reasonably expect to enjoy
rising standards of living. Living standards can be compared in
terms of real GDP per capita, which historically in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> has doubled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 35 years</TIMEX>.20 In considering future living
standards, doubling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 35 years</TIMEX> represents a way to gauge
whether future generations will enjoy an improvement comparable to
that enjoyed by previous generations. Suppose the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
could maintain gross national saving at its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> GDP share of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.3</NUMEX>
percent through some combination of personal, business, and
government saving. This constant saving rate is roughly comparable
to saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX> but is
considerably higher after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> (as shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX>). As shown
in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>, GDP per capita under the Constant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">National</ENAMEX>
Saving Rate simulation would fall short of doubling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 35 years</TIMEX>.
GDP per capita in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2035</TIMEX> would be nearly double the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> level
(falling short by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 8 percent</NUMEX>), and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2070</TIMEX>, GDP per capita
would fall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 13 percent</NUMEX> short of doubling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2035</TIMEX> level. Yet,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Constant 2000 National Saving Rate simulation</ENAMEX> yields a vast
improvement in future living standards compared to saving the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses. Although national saving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> was
relatively low compared to past <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> experience, maintaining that
level (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.3 percent</NUMEX> of GDP) over the long run would not be easy as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> ages. The Constant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Saving Rate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulation</ENAMEX> is intended only to show how saving more results in
higher economic growth over the long term. It should not be
interpreted as a recommendation about how much the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
needs to save because saving is not free and there are other ways
in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> can and will
adjust. For example, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live longer, rather than save more
to finance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years</TIMEX> of retirement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> could choose to
work longer and postpone retirement.
Clearly, saving more would improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s long-term
economic outlook-but how much more do we need to save? Establishing
a tradeoff between the consumption of current and future
generations entails value judgments that economic theory alone
cannot provide. Initially, increasing saving and investment adds to
the capital stock and boosts worker productivity and the economy's
rate of growth. In the long run, a larger capital stock also
requires more saving just to replace depreciating capital. After
reaching this long-run equilibrium, increased saving and investment
yields a higher level of GDP per capita but does not boost worker
productivity and economic growth. Permanently boosting the rate of
GDP growth would require ever-increasing relative shares of saving
and
20Since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, annual growth in GDP per capita has
averaged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 2 percent</NUMEX>. Of course, growth was faster during
some periods-the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950s and 1960s</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half</TIMEX> of the
1990s-and slower during other periods-the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</TIMEX>.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-591SP <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Saving</ENAMEX>
investment. From a macroeconomic perspective, any increase in
saving up to the "golden rule saving rate" allows a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> to
increase consumption in the long run<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX> Below the golden rule rate,
saving and investing more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> permits increased consumption.
Saving beyond the golden rule rate is counterproductive and would
reduce consumption not only initially but also in the long-term.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s saving rate is unlikely to reach the golden
rule level, much less exceed it. Given the steady decline in the
personal saving rate, it is doubtful that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> would willingly
reduce consumption so much that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> would be at risk of
saving too much. Estimates based on our long-term growth model
suggest that the golden rule saving rate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
would be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 30 percent</NUMEX>. These estimates also suggest that
increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> national saving would not substantially decrease
the return to capital and therefore could provide significant
improvement to future incomes and consumption. Although the golden
rule saving rate can be a useful analytical concept in evaluating a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s saving, the golden rule is not the best policy for saving.
Maximizing consumption per capita over the long term may not be
socially optimal if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> value current consumption more than
future consumption and discount the future.
Another way to gauge national saving is to estimate how much we
need to save to achieve specific national objectives. In simple
terms, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> could act like a "target saver." For example, a
key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> would be saving enough to afford the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s costs for
supporting the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Boosting saving and GDP is
unlikely to prevent a rise in the share of GDP devoted to
government spending on the elderly because economic growth also
tends to increase health spending and raise retirement benefits-
although with a lengthy lag for the latter. A more realistic goal
would be to increase saving by an amount that would generate a rise
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">future</TIMEX> GDP equivalent to the increase in spending on the
elderly. Recent economic research estimated that increasing saving
as a share of GDP by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> percentage point above the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> rate would
boost GDP enough to cover <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> of the increase in elderly
costs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between now</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2050.22</NUMEX> This is
21The golden rule saving rate maximizes consumption per capita

While it is unclear just what the right level of saving is, it
is clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> needs to begin saving more if it is to avoid
severe problems in the future. Saving now is vital because
expanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s productive capacity through national saving
and investment is a long-term process. While saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security surpluses is a laudable fiscal policy goal, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> need
to save more to ensure their own retirement security as well as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s future prosperity. Increased saving by current generations
would expand the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital stock, allowing future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> to better afford the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s retirement costs while
also enjoying higher standards of living.

Q4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. How Has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Fiscal Policy</ENAMEX>
Affected
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. National Saving</ENAMEX>?
A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. Federal fiscal policy affects the federal surplus or
deficit which, when measured on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> basis, represents the amount
of federal government saving or dissaving, which in turn directly
affects national saving. Federal deficits subtract from national
saving by absorbing funds saved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and
other levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that would otherwise be available for
investment. To finance a budget deficit, the federal government
borrows from the public by issuing debt securities, adding to its
debt held by the public<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conversely</ENAMEX>, federal surpluses, as
measured under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NIPA</ENAMEX>, add to national saving and increase resources
available for investment. When a budget surplus occurs, the federal
government can use excess funds to reduce the debt held by the
public.
Text box <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> explains how the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NIPA</ENAMEX> surplus or deficit differs
from the federal unified budget surplus or deficit. While the NIPA
measure reflects how government saving affects national saving
available for investment, the unified budget measure is the more
common frame of reference for discussing federal fiscal policy
issues. Given that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures are roughly similar as a share
of GDP, in this section we use the unified budget measure unless
otherwise specified.
1Federal debt held by the public is also called "publicly held
debt" but is not the same as "public debt." Debt held by the public
plus debt held by government accounts, such as budget trust funds,
compose gross federal debt. For more information, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Debt</ENAMEX>:

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Text Box</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX>: How do the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> and federal unified budget
concepts of federal surpluses and deficits differ?
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NIPA</ENAMEX> federal surplus was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2 percent</NUMEX> of GDP while
the unified budget surplus was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.4 percent</NUMEX>. Although the two
measures are roughly similar, there are some conceptual
differences. The federal unified budget measure is generally a cash
or cash-equivalent measure in which receipts are recorded when
received and expenditures are recorded when paid regardless of the
accounting period in which the receipts are earned or the costs
incurred. Thus, the unified surplus reflects the difference between
federal receipts and all federal government outlays including those
used to purchase capital goods, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons systems</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NIPA</ENAMEX> federal budget surplus, however, reflects
the current, or operating, account of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and
does not count purchases of capital goods as current spending.
Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> includes a depreciation charge ("consumption of
general government fixed capital") in current spending as a proxy
for the contribution of capital to the output of government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> and federal unified budget measures also differ in
their treatment of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' pension programs. In the
unified budget, federal employee pension benefits are recorded as
outlays when paid in cash; these outlays are offset, in whole or in
part, by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' contributions to the
pension programs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, counts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
contribution to the pension programs as an outlay to the household
sector, where the contribution is added to personal income and
saving. The benefits paid by the pension programs are not counted
as government outlays under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> but rather as a drawdown of
accumulated household assets.
Other differences between the unified budget and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> measures
arise because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> focuses on current income and production within
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> excludes capital transfers,
like estate tax receipts, which are recorded as revenue in the
unified budget, and investment grants-in-aid to state and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, which the unified budget records as outlays. Lastly,
revenue and spending related to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>,
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX> are counted in the federal unified
budget but not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX>.
The unified budget measure is useful in explaining annual
changes in the federal debt held by the public. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> measure is
useful in explaining how government saving has affected net
national saving available for investment. Again, these measures
yield roughly similar estimates of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s budget
position as a share of GDP. In order to provide a consistent frame
of reference for discussing federal fiscal policy issues, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> refers to the unified budget measure unless otherwise
specified.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the 1970s through the mid 1990s</TIMEX>, federal deficits consumed
a large share of increasingly scarce private saving and reduced the
amount of national saving available for investment.2 Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> have taken action to eliminate the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> federal budget deficit through several initiatives including
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Budget Enforcement Act of 1990</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnibus</ENAMEX> Budget
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reconciliation Act of 1993</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Balanced Budget Act of 1997</ENAMEX>. As
noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 2</ENAMEX>, the combination of these policy actions and
strong economic growth reduced federal government dissaving over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX>). With the swing to surplus in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, federal government saving added to the saving of other
sectors to increase the amount of national saving available for
investment. Unified budget surpluses since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> have been the
longest-running surpluses in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 50 years</TIMEX>, and federal budget
surpluses are projected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX>. So far, the federal
government has used excess funds to reduce debt held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>,
paying down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$223 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX> alone<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>

Although one might expect an increase in federal saving to lead
to an increase in national saving, changes in federal saving do not
flow through to changes in national saving and investment in a
dollar-for-dollar relationship. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> illustrates that federal
and nonfederal saving, which consist mainly of private saving, tend
to be inversely related. In other words, when federal government
saving increases (smaller deficits or larger surpluses), private
saving may decrease somewhat. When federal saving decreases
(smaller surpluses or larger deficits), private saving may
increase. For example in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX>, although federal government
saving increased as a share of GDP by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 percentage points</NUMEX> from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990 to 2000</TIMEX>, net national saving increased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1.1</NUMEX> percentage
points because private saving as a share of GDP decreased by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.9</NUMEX>
percentage points over the same period<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
4The total change in net national saving from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990 to 2000</TIMEX> was
also affected by an increase in state and local government saving
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.6</NUMEX> percentage points.

Q4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>. Why <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Do Government and Private Saving</ENAMEX>
Tend to Move in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opposite Directions</ENAMEX>?
A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>. Government and private saving tend to move in opposite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX> for several reasons-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of which are discussed here.
First, federal borrowing can be large enough to affect current
interest rates, which in turn may influence private saving and
investment. Government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissaving</ENAMEX> absorbs funds available for
private investment and puts upward pressure on interest rates.
Higher interest rates both raise the return on saving and reduce
the market value of existing financial assets issued when rates
were lower.5 The combination of higher returns to saving and
reduced wealth might encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> to save
more. Conversely, an increase in government saving adds to the
supply of resources available for investment and may put downward
pressure on interest rates. Lower interest rates both reduce the
return on saving and increase the market value of existing
financial assets issued when rates were higher. Lower returns to
saving and increased wealth might dampen private saving.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, if federal budget surpluses are achieved, in part,
through higher taxes, those higher taxes reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>'
disposable personal income. As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1</ENAMEX>, disposable
personal income is the after-tax personal income (including
government transfer payments) available for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' consumption
and saving. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Households</ENAMEX> may choose to save <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less</NUMEX> of their disposable
income and maintain their current level of consumption especially
if they consider the higher tax payments to be temporary. Reduced
personal saving would tend to offset the increased government
saving due to higher taxes.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saving has some
effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' expectations about future tax rates even
across generations. This Ricardian equivalence hypothesis holds
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are forward-looking and recognize that current
government surpluses or deficits affect government debt and future
tax rates.6 Thus, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> runs deficits and accumulates
debt, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ricardian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> would save more to ensure that they or
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> can pay the expected higher future taxes.
Alternatively, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> runs
5For example, market prices of interest-bearing securities, such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities, fluctuate inversely with market interest
rates. The market price of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> security falls when the
current interest rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities of equal maturity
rises.

surpluses and reduces debt held by the public (as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ricardian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> would save less in anticipation
of future tax cuts. If all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> were fully <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricardian</ENAMEX>, private
saving would fully offset any change in government saving, and
national saving would be unchanged. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX> continue to debate
how well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricardian</ENAMEX> equivalence theory works in practice. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
may be too shortsighted in their saving decisions to look ahead to
the implications of current government debt on future generations.
When federal budget deficits and debt mounted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, private
saving declined-the opposite of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricardian</ENAMEX> equivalence
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> would suggest. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, as figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX>
illustrates, private saving-which is the major component of
nonfederal saving-declined as federal saving rose-which is
consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricardian</ENAMEX> equivalence hypothesis.
In summary, it is unclear how much each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">additional dollar</NUMEX> of
government saving will ultimately increase national saving.
Evidence shows that changes in saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and businesses
tend to offset some of the changes in government saving. While
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> disagree over the magnitude of the private saving
offset, studies generally suggest it is less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-for-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. This
means that for each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">additional dollar</NUMEX> of government saving,
aggregate private saving falls by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than a dollar</NUMEX>. To what
extent the aggregate offset is due to the changes in interest
rates, wealth, disposable personal income, expectations of future
tax rates, or other reasons is ambiguous. Estimating the private
saving offset is complicated by the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> may
respond differently to changes in government saving<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX>
A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>. While media attention has focused on budget surpluses
projected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 10 years</TIMEX>, the long-term outlook for federal
government saving has received considerably less attention. The
outlook for government saving over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 75 years</TIMEX> is subject to
wide ranging uncertainty due to economic changes and future
legislation. However, one certainty is that as life expectancy
rises and the baby boom generation retires, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> population
will age, and fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> will support each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retiree</ENAMEX>. The
7For example, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> live paycheck-to-paycheck and
might spend all of a tax cut, whereas other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> might spend
only a portion; a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ricardian</ENAMEX> household might save all of a tax cut
in anticipation of future tax increases. For further discussion
about accommodating consumer behavior in modeling fiscal policy,

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX> budget will increasingly be driven by demographic
trends. Absent changes to current law, government saving is likely
to decline as government health and retirement programs for the
growing elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> claim a larger share of federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>.
Any fiscal policy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> in which some portion of the anticipated

"saved." Saving some portion of the projected budget surpluses
would allow the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to reduce the overhang of
federal debt built over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of deficit spending. Using

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Debt</ENAMEX> is Not an Option
If the projected budget surpluses materialize, the federal
government will reach the point at which the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> surpluses will
exceed the amount of debt available to be redeemed or that can be
bought back at reasonable prices. Although estimates as to when
this point will be reached vary depending on several assumptions,
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> agree that it could occur within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX>;
estimates range from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX>'s (CBO)
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX> estimate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2001</TIMEX> estimate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX>. This point will occur before
the debt held by the public is eliminated, and the resulting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of cash will require decisions about what to do with
these cash balances. This raises the question of how the federal
government can save if reducing federal debt held by the public is
not an option.
Just as the flow of personal saving affects the stock of
financial assets accumulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, government saving
affects the stock of federal debt. The federal government borrows
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to finance a deficit. Conversely, when a budget
surplus occurs, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can use excess funds to
reduce the debt held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, accumulate cash balances, or
acquire nonfederal financial assets. Holding cash or nonfederal
financial assets would not reduce debt held by the public but would
reduce the net debt of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Net debt represents
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s total financial liabilities, including
debt held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, less its total financial assets. Positive
amounts of net debt reflect how much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s private wealth
has been absorbed to finance federal deficits. Negative amounts of
net debt reflect how much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s private financial assets
have been acquired by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Acquiring nonfederal financial assets could be another way to
translate budget surpluses into resources available for investment.
However, the issue of the federal ownership of nonfederal assets is
controversial. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>, among others,
has expressed concern that there would be tremendous political
pressure to steer the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s asset selection to
achieve economic, social, or political purposes. Although the
governance issues may not be insurmountable, another possible
concern is that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> could become the largest
single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investor</ENAMEX>.
There is a growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of experience by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> that
might help policymakers address the question of whether and how the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can or should acquire nonfederal financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruments</ENAMEX>. Investing in the financial markets is a standard
practice for state and local government pension funds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. Also, other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> have decided that the potential risks
of political interference can be managed and are outweighed by what
those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> perceive as the risk of failing to save for the
future or provide a cushion for contingencies. In the future, we
plan to study how other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> invest in nongovernmental assets to
learn more about how they deal with governance and other issues
Note: The net debt concept is based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OECD</ENAMEX> definition of
net financial liabilities that can be calculated by subtracting
financial assets from financial liabilities.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the fiscal policy debate has focused on the
importance of saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> portion of projected
unified budget surpluses. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policymakers</ENAMEX> appear to have
generally agreed to save <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses, there is
considerable debate over whether and how to use the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security surpluses. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> of fiscal discipline and
focus on fiscal responsibility, the anticipated surpluses offer a
chance to meet pent-up demand for discretionary domestic spending,
increase defense spending, cut taxes, shore up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, reduce the debt, or do some combination of these. How the
surpluses are used has long-term implications for federal
government saving, national saving, and ultimately the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
future living standards<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>
To get a sense of the long-term implications of broad fiscal
policy choices, we examined the fiscal and economic outlook over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 75 years</TIMEX> under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternatives: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) assuming that the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saves only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
assuming that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saves the entire unified
surpluses<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> For simplicity, these fiscal policy simulations assume
that saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and state and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> remains constant as a share of GDP and that the
surpluses saved are used to reduce debt held by the public<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> Once
debt held by the public is eliminated, these simulations assume
excess cash is used to acquire an unspecified mix of nonfederal
assets with a rate of return equivalent to the average interest
rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX>

11As noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 3</ENAMEX>, simulations are illustrative and do not
represent forecasts. See appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> for a detailed description of
the long-term modeling methodology.
12Acquiring nonfederal financial assets would reduce the
reported unified surplus or increase the unified deficit because,
under current budget scoring rules, such acquisitions would be
treated as spending.
Saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses produces unified budget
surpluses for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost 20 years</TIMEX>, as shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>, and
eliminates the debt held by the public by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2015</TIMEX>. Under the Save the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX>, the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses are eliminated by an unspecified mix of permanent tax
cuts and spending increases. Under this scenario, unified budget
deficits emerge again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2019</TIMEX>-just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> programs are being strained by the retiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> boom
generation. As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 3</ENAMEX>, the large deficits and debt
under this simulation imply a substantial reduction in national
saving and investment in the capital stock leading to a decline in
living standards-in terms of GDP per capita. Although policymakers
would likely act to reduce the budget deficits and to promote
higher national saving before facing the economic doomsday implied
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX>, this
scenario serves as a reminder to be cautious in committing
surpluses to large permanent tax cuts and spending increases.

Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX> also shows an alternative fiscal policy path assuming
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saves all of the projected unified
surpluses. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Save the Unified Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX>, federal
budget surpluses would be higher over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 40 years</TIMEX>, but
deficits would emerge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2040s</TIMEX>. Although the

government would have to borrow again from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to finance
deficits over the long run, the simulation implies that, absent
policy or economic change, debt held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> could be fully
eliminated before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the decade.13</TIMEX> Just as the Save the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX> is an implausible doomsday
scenario, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Save the Unified Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX> can also be
viewed as implausible. Under this simulation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> federal
surpluses, which peak at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> of GDP, would last <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer than</TIMEX>
ever before in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s history and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would hold
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonfederal</ENAMEX> financial assets for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 50 years</TIMEX>.
A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>. Government saving directly affects future budgetary
flexibility through its effect on interest payment spending. In the
past, interest payments contributed to deficits and helped fuel a
rising debt burden. Rising debt, in turn, raised interest costs to
the budget, and the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> increased debt held by the
public to finance these interest payments. A change from a budget
deficit to a surplus reduces federal debt and replaces this
"vicious cycle" with a "virtuous cycle" in which saving some
portion of the budget surpluses results in lower debt levels. Lower
debt levels lead to lower interest payments-possibly at lower
interest rates. These lower interest payments in turn lead to
larger potential surpluses and/or increased budget flexibility.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> shows the long-term implications for budgetary
flexibility of saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses. Again, this
simulation assumes that nonfederal saving remains constant as a
share of GDP at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.1 percent</NUMEX>, the average nonfederal saving rate
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. Absent program changes, saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses-and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">surpluses14-</ENAMEX>is not enough by itself
to finance the retirement and health programs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>. As
figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> shows, saving only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses will
not be sufficient to accommodate both the projected growth in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and health entitlements and other national
priorities in the long term. These programs will eventually squeeze
out most or all other spending. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2030</TIMEX>, saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses results in a
13Although estimates as to when this point will be reached vary

"haircut" for spending on programs other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>. In other words, there is increasingly less

Over the long-term, meaningful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
reform will be necessary to avert massive government dissaving,
reduce the economic burden of government spending for an aging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, and restore budgetary flexibility to address other
national priorities. Q4.10 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q4.12</ENAMEX> discuss the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>

Just as saving more of the anticipated budget surpluses would
enhance future budgetary flexibility, increasing private saving
would also improve the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s budget outlook. As
discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 3</ENAMEX>, increasing national saving boosts
investment and economic growth. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy is
essentially the tax base for the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, economic
growth in turn increases government revenue. Increased economic

A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>. Fiscal policy choices about how much of the surpluses to

the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s longterm economic outlook. Saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to enjoy higher standards of living
in the future, as figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX> shows. However, under the Save the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX>, GDP per capita growth slows
and eventually turns negative. Even if the entire unified surplus
were saved, GDP per capita would fall somewhat short of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
historical average of doubling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 35 years</TIMEX>. The implication of
such simulations is that even if government saving is sustained at
unprecedented levels, future generations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> might not enjoy
a rise in living standards comparable to that enjoyed by previous
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. Thus, saving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses is not enough
to ensure retirement security for the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> without

It is tempting to push aside gloomy simulation results and to
discount the significance of fiscal constraints <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several decades</TIMEX> in
the future, but recent good news about the budget does not mean
that difficult budget choices are a thing of the past. The history
of budget forecasts should be a reminder not to be complacent about
the certainty that large surpluses will materialize over the next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> as projected. Not so long ago the forecasts were for
"deficits as far as the eye can see." Budget projections are
inherently uncertain and even a small change in one assumption can
lead to very large changes in the fiscal outlook over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> (CBO) describes its projections
as more tentative than usual because the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s
productivity growth assumption is based on data only for the past

productivity growth has indeed accelerated or has just
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temporarily</ENAMEX> deviated from underlying historical trends as it has
many times in the past<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX> Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> have declared that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy has entered a new era of more rapid economic growth,
and it is possible that future growth could be even more robust
than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s baseline economic projections assume. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> has
pointed out that the recent burst in productivity may prove
temporary if the "new economy" turns out to be just a flash in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pan</ENAMEX>.
In addition to the greater-than-usual uncertainty about
productivity growth, it is too soon to tell whether recent boosts
in federal revenue reflect a structural change in the economy or a
more temporary divergence from historical trends. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> has pointed
out that simply assuming a return to historical trends and slightly
faster growth in health care spending would dramatically reduce the
surpluses projected. Given these uncertainties, lower unified
surpluses and even deficits are possible budget outcomes over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next decade</TIMEX>.
Caution is warranted before committing the anticipated surpluses
to permanent changes on either the revenue or spending side.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">policymakers</ENAMEX> appear to have generally agreed to save
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses, there is considerable debate over
whether and how to use the rest of the projected surpluses. Yet,
the amounts available for new tax or spending initiatives may be
considerably less than policymakers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> anticipate<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s budget projections are intended to provide estimates of
federal spending and revenue assuming current law related to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxation</ENAMEX> and entitlement programs is unchanged. For this reason,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s projections do not reflect the full cost of maintaining
current policies if maintaining those policies would require
enacting new legislation. For example, the budget projections do
not reflect the costs of laws that are regularly extended for a few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> at a time, such as continuing payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> that have

surpluses increase national saving available for private
investment, increasing federal spending on infrastructure, if
properly designed and administered, can be another way to increase
national saving and investment. Federal spending on education and

increase economic growth and could possibly reduce growth.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>, many federal investments have little net economic
benefit- either because they are selected for political or other
noneconomic reasons or because they displace more productive
private-sector or state and local investments. See The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic</ENAMEX>

immediate as well as long-term public demands for safety,
health, and improved quality of life. While most infrastructure
spending takes place at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, local, or private-sector level,
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> also invests in infrastructure such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, and air traffic control<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> As federal unified

Federal spending on education and nondefense <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R&D</ENAMEX>, which is
intended to enhance the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s long-term productivity, also
remained relatively constant as a share of GDP over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>.
At some point, reducing federal unified deficits or maintaining
unified surpluses at the expense of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> and education
spending raises concerns about future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' skills,
technological advancement, and, thus, economic growth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> and
education have long been seen as areas for government activity
given the private sector's inability to capture all of the societal
benefits that such investments provide. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has
played a central role in supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R&D</ENAMEX> and thus enhancing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s long-term productivity. One rationale for this has been
that the societal gains from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R&D</ENAMEX>, for example, are often not
felt until far in the future and so might not provide much profit
for an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>. The Internet, computers, communications

many purposes, but one of its primary functions is to control
obligations up-front before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> commitment is made. As a
result, the budget process tends to view a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> spent on
consumption the same as a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> spent on investment because both
represent commitments by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and represent resources
taken out of the private sector for use by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Some
have argued that the budget may actually favor short-term
consumption because the cost of both must be scored up-front as
part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Budget Enforcement Act</ENAMEX> process even though most of the
benefits from investment programs accrue in the future<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> In the
past, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has suggested that the budget could better facilitate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">policymakers</ENAMEX>' weighing choices between federal investment and
consumption by incorporating an investment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> with
agreed-upon levels of investment spending. This could promote the
consideration of spending intended to benefit the economy over the
long term while maintaining overall fiscal discipline<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.25</NUMEX> As the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> moves to modify the federal budget process with the
expiration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Budget Enforcement Act</ENAMEX>, attention is warranted as
to how the process considers the long-term implications of
alternative spending choices.
A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX>. Although increasing government saving is the most direct
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> for the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to increase national saving, the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can also encourage saving and investment by
state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and the private sector. For example,
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> provides funding- such as grants, loans, or
loan guarantees-to state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to finance the
construction and improvement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX>, mass transit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, and water systems. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> also provides
financial aid to encourage postsecondary education. In addition to
its direct spending, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> offers tax incentives
to encourage nonfederal saving and investment. The revenue loss
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with a tax incentive represents the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
budgetary cost of promoting saving and investment for particular
purposes.

tax rates-for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Under current
law, some types of saving and investment are exempt from taxes
while other types are fully taxed; some forms of consumption-in
particular, health care- receive preferential treatment. Although a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> discussion of income versus consumption taxes is
beyond the scope of this primer, it is helpful to highlight various
federal tax incentives for saving and investment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX>
The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> uses tax incentives to encourage
particular forms of investment. Some tax provisions allow
accelerated depreciation so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> can more quickly
recover the costs of investing in certain types of equipment and
structures. Other tax incentives encourage investment in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s infrastructure. For example, interest income on state and
local government bonds, which are used primarily for infrastructure
purposes, are exempt from federal taxes. This tax preference allows
state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to borrow at lower rates to build
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, mass transit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and water systems. In
addition, tax preferences may encourage particular forms of
infrastructure investment, such as special tax credits for
investments in developing low-income rental housing. Also, special
tax credits and deductions are aimed at spurring private
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX>.
The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> also has sought to encourage personal
saving both to enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' financial security and to boost
national saving. Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> highlights some tax provisions aimed at
encouraging saving for retirement, buying <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, and investing in
education<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.27</NUMEX> The largest tax incentive for saving-in terms of the
tax revenue loss-is the preferential tax treatment of
employer-sponsored pension plans; additional tax incentives
encourage retirement saving outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> pensions. The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest category of tax incentives aimed at encouraging
saving promotes home ownership. Other tax incentives encourage
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">college</ENAMEX> and other postsecondary education. While some tax
incentives for education encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to accumulate assets
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Series</ENAMEX> EE savings

27While this discussion focuses on tax incentives encouraging
personal saving, some federal programs and tax provisions may
actually discourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from saving. As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1</ENAMEX>,

provisions, such as the HOPE credit, are aimed more at making

For individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, tax incentives increase the after-tax
return on saving for particular purposes or on specific types of
assets accumulated. This would narrow the wedge between the
individual's return on saving and society's return on investment
that results from the taxation of income from saving. As explained
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1</ENAMEX>, higher rates of return may or may not encourage
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to save more. For the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, tax incentives
reduce tax revenue and hence government saving. How tax incentives
affect personal saving, and ultimately, national saving is less
certain. The net effect on national saving-discussed further in
Q4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>- depends on the interaction between any additional personal
saving and government dissaving associated with financing the
incentive.
Tax incentives affect how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save for retirement but do not
necessarily increase the overall level of personal saving. Since
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1970s</NUMEX>, preferential tax treatment has been granted to
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and employer-sponsored 401(k)
pension plans. Even with these retirement saving incentives, the
personal saving rate has steadily declined. Although the tax
benefits indeed seem to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to contribute to
these kinds of accounts, the amounts contributed may not be totally
new saving. Some contributions may represent saving that would have
occurred even without the tax incentives or amounts merely shifted
from taxable assets or even financed by borrowing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economists</ENAMEX>
disagree about whether tax incentives are effective in increasing
the overall level of personal saving. In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> symposium examining
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> IRAs available in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> reached
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> widely divergent conclusions: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) yes, most contributions
represented new saving, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) no, most IRA contributions were not new
saving, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) maybe, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 26 cents</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">each dollar</NUMEX> contributed
may have represented new saving<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX>
Even if tax incentives do not increase personal saving much in
the short term, they may encourage individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to earmark
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> specifically for retirement. Once the funds are earmarked
in retirement accounts, the prospect of taxes and penalties for
early withdrawals might induce some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to save more outside
of retirement accounts to achieve nonretirement goals. However, if
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can readily withdraw money from tax-preferred accounts for
purposes other than retirement, there is no assurance that tax
incentives would ultimately enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' retirement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>.
Allowing access to voluntary accounts like IRAs or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">401</NUMEX>(k) plans
before retirement-through borrowing or early withdrawals to buy a

provisions may increase saving because more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may choose to
participate and to contribute larger amounts<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.30</NUMEX> Yet, borrowing and
early withdrawals can ultimately reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' retirement
income. There would be little benefit to national saving from
allowing early access to mandatory accounts with set contribution
levels-which has been proposed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> (see Q4.10 and
Q4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>).
A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>. The net effect on national saving depends on whether a tax
incentive induces enough additional saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to make up
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s revenue loss. To gain a better understanding
of how tax incentives affect national saving, look at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> example:
how a tax deduction for a traditional tax-deferred IRA may affect
government and ultimately national saving. For simplicity, consider
a married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in which neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> is covered by an
employer-sponsored pension plan and each contributes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX>-the
maximum per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> per year allowed under current law-to a
traditional IRA. As shown in table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>, how much the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> contribution adds to national saving that year
depends on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) how much their IRA tax deduction costs the
government and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) whether their contributions represent new saving
or were shifted from existing assets. Further assume, for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simplicity</ENAMEX>, that our hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s marginal tax rate is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
percent, so their deduction costs the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,120</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
percent of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX>). In other words, government saving decreases by
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,120</NUMEX> (or government dissaving increases by that amount, depending
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s surplus/deficit position for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>). If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> would have otherwise spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the $4,000</NUMEX> (i.e., their
contributions represent new saving), national saving would increase
by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,880</NUMEX>-the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> increase in personal saving less the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,120</NUMEX>
decrease in government saving. At the other extreme, if the couple
merely shifted the funds from another account or asset to the IRAs
(i.e., no increase in personal saving), national saving would fall
by the amount of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s tax loss. The actual change in
national saving probably falls somewhere between these two
examples. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4.2</ENAMEX> also provides a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> scenario-the impact on
national saving if <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 26 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>'s contributions
represent new saving. In this case, national saving would drop
slightly, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> would have saved more and expressly
earmarked more of their assets for retirement.

Note: This table illustrates a hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in which
neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> is covered by an employersponsored retirement plan
and each contributes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX> to a traditional IRA. Their <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> IRA
contributions are fully deductible. If either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> is covered by
an employer-sponsored plan, their contributions may not be fully
deductible depending on their income.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aChange</ENAMEX> in personal saving depends on how much of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> IRA
contribution represents new saving. These assumptions were drawn
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> presented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Fall 1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of Economic</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perspectives</ENAMEX>; see footnote <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bChange</ENAMEX> in government saving represents tax revenue loss in
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> due solely to tax deduction for IRA contribution. Amount
does not include revenue forgone as a result of tax-deferral on
investment income. Taxes on contribution and investment income are
deferred until amounts are withdrawn.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cChange</ENAMEX> in national saving represents the sum of the change in
personal and government saving for a simplified example focused on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of IRA. The ultimate effect of any tax
incentive on national saving would depend on how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in
aggregate respond.
Source: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> analysis based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> individual income tax rates
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> publication 590 Individual Retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arrangements</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4.2</ENAMEX> also shows the effect on national saving of
tax-deductible IRA contributions under different tax brackets. If
our hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> were in the highest income tax bracket and
their contributions represented all new saving, their <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX>
deduction would cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,584</NUMEX> and add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,416</NUMEX> to
national saving. If they were in the lowest tax bracket, their
deduction would cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600</NUMEX> and add <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $3,400</NUMEX>
to national saving. Of course, this simplified example focuses on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">household</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of IRA<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX> The ultimate effect of any tax
incentive on national saving would depend on how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> in
aggregate respond. A tax incentive for retirement saving may
encourage some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to save more while encouraging others to
shift their existing balances into tax-preferred accounts.
Again, the net effect of a tax incentive on national saving
depends on whether the tax incentive induces enough additional
personal saving to make up for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s revenue loss. As
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>, deductions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> in higher tax
brackets are more costly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Although deductions
for lower-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> appear to yield a greater net increase
in national saving because they are less costly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>,
they also offer relatively less incentive for lowerincome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
to save. Low- and moderate-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have fewer resources
and may have less capacity to contribute to an IRA or to earmark
more assets for retirement. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> saving through taxpreferred
retirement accounts are middle- to upper-income. Although
higher-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> might be encouraged to save more by
increasing the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> contribution limits to IRAs and
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">employer-sponsored 401</ENAMEX>(k) plans-currently <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000 and $10,500</NUMEX>,
respectively-increasing contribution limits alone is not likely to
induce more saving from low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>. Nonrefundable tax
incentives may not be particularly effective in encouraging saving
by lower-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, who already owe relatively little or no
federal income taxes.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policymakers</ENAMEX> have explored providing refundable
tax incentives and government matching to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to
save more. Text box <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX> describes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> federal initiatives allowing
governmentsubsidized saving accounts for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.

on their circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may also be able to choose from
nondeductible traditional IRAs, new <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX> IRAs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEP</ENAMEX> IRAs for the

popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">401</ENAMEX>(k) employersponsored saving plans. The oddly named

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Savers</ENAMEX>
Individual development accounts (IDAs) are special saving
accounts for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. In theory, IDAs help lowincome
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> save, accumulate assets, and achieve economic
self-sufficiency. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDAs</ENAMEX> are like the better known IRAs in the sense
that the assets accumulated are to be used only for limited
purposes. Whereas IRAs are for retirement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDAs</ENAMEX> can be used to buy
a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> home, to pay for college or other job training, or to start
a small business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDAs</ENAMEX> are special in that low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX>
receive matching funds from federal and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> as well
as private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> as an incentive to save. Usually,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDA</ENAMEX> account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> must undergo economic literacy training as a
condition of participation.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> welfare reform law allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temporary</ENAMEX>
Assistance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Needy Family</ENAMEX> (TANF) funds to establish subsidized
saving accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TANF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TANF</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> are to make
contributions from earnings, and state matching funds used for IDAs
count towards a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s maintenance-of-effort spending requirement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDA</ENAMEX> balances generally are not to be considered in determining
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eligibility</ENAMEX> and benefits for means-tested federal programs.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Social Development</ENAMEX>, as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> had passed legislation establishing IDA programs, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> had incorporated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDAs</ENAMEX> into their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TANF</ENAMEX> plans. Matching rates
and dollar limits vary by state. Matching rates range from
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-to-one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>.
Limits on IDA balances range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> restrict IDA
use to paying for education or training.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assets</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Independence Act of 1998</ENAMEX> authorized federal
funding for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5-year</TIMEX> demonstration project to evaluate the
effectiveness of matching incentives for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">savers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDA</ENAMEX>
demonstration project provides direct federal funding to state and
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> as well as nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community organizations</ENAMEX> to
match saving contributions by low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> eligible for TANF
or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earned Income Tax Credit</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1999 and 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">$10</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> was appropriated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> for the demonstration project.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those 2 years</TIMEX>, awards totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17.7 million</NUMEX> were made to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> sponsoring IDA programs. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX>
was appropriated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDA</ENAMEX> demonstration. Because the first
grants were awarded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1999</TIMEX>, it is too soon in the
demonstration project to fully evaluate the effectiveness of IDAs
as a saving incentive.

retirement contributions for low- and moderate-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.32 Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSA</ENAMEX> proposal, a worker <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of 25</TIMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> with family earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $5,000</NUMEX> could contribute up
to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> through either an employer-sponsored saving plan
or a tax-deferred individual account<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> earning up to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12,500</NUMEX> was to receive a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">200 percent</NUMEX>) match on the
first <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> contributed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> match (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>
percent) on additional contributions. The progressive matching
formula was to phase down as income increased. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> earning
between <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000 and $40,000</NUMEX> was to receive a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> match on
the first <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> contributed and additional contributions. For
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who did not owe federal income taxes, the government
match was to be in the form of a tax credit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> or
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> holding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX>'s account. Although the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSAs</ENAMEX> were aimed at accumulating assets for retirement, the proposal
would have allowed limited withdrawals after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX> for such
purposes as buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or paying educational or medical
expenses.
At this time, it is unclear how new tax-subsidized saving
accounts might affect personal saving and ultimately national
saving. Like any tax incentive, matching tax credits would clearly
reduce federal revenue and government saving. The tax credits by
themselves would have no net effect on national saving: absent any
change in household consumption, personal saving would increase by
the amount of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> match, but government saving would
decrease by the same amount. Of course, the purpose of matching is
to change household behavior. Government matching of voluntary
contributions could increase national saving if these incentives
indeed induce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more.34</NUMEX> A progressive match- providing
a higher match for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and eliminating the match for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">high-income workers</ENAMEX>-would serve to target low-income
32President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Savings Accounts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
proposal would have created a more costly centralized system of
accounts with a flat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> general tax credit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $300</NUMEX> for
low- and moderate-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> plus a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 to 100 percent</NUMEX>
government match on voluntary contributions. Low-income workers
were to receive a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> match on their contributions, and the
match progressively declined based on income so that higher-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> would receive a lower match or none at all.
33Contribution limits and eligibility thresholds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSAs</ENAMEX> for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> were twice the amount for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. For example, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> could contribute <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
34Depending on the design and implementation, government
matching could potentially reduce national saving. For example, a
household could transfer amounts from existing assets to get the
government match and then increase consumption in response to its
increased wealth.
Q4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>. What Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government Doing</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Educate the Public About Why Saving Matters</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who now receive little tax benefit from existing
retirement saving incentives. Even with generous matching,
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> may not voluntarily save more for retirement. In
light of the conflicting expert views on how existing tax
incentives affect personal saving, it is unclear how new matching
incentives might affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' saving choices and retirement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>.
A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>. While a great deal of attention focuses on how much
retirement saving tax incentives cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and how much,
if any, new personal saving they generate, what is sometimes
overlooked is that tax incentives remind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to save for
retirement. The existence of IRAs and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">401</NUMEX>(k)s serves to raise
public awareness about retirement saving opportunities. Advertising
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">financial institutions</ENAMEX> offering IRAs and information about
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">employer-sponsored 401</ENAMEX>(k) options serve as reminders about ways to
save for retirement. Yet, even as the tax code provides more
opportunities than ever to save for retirement, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> may not
understand why saving matters.
In the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Savings Are Vital</ENAMEX> for Everyone's <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Retirement Act of 1997</ENAMEX>"
(<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SAVER Act</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> found that a leading obstacle to
expanding retirement saving is that many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> do not know how
to save for retirement, let alone how much. According to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Summit on Retirement Savings</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> must do a better
job of educating the public- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> alike-about
the importance of saving more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to secure the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
retirement security<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> Increasing personal saving is vital to
enhancing individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' retirement security, to increasing
national saving available to invest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital stock,
and ultimately to reducing the burden on future generations of
financing government programs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>.
As mandated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SAVER Act</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX> maintains
an outreach program to raise public awareness about the advantages
of saving and to help educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> about how much they need to
save for retirement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX>'s original Retirement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savings Education Campaign</ENAMEX> was launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> in partnership with
the
35Final Report on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The National Summit</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retirement Savings</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1998</TIMEX>). This bipartisan summit, held
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4-5, 1998</TIMEX>, was mandated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SAVER Act</ENAMEX>. Additional national
summits are to be held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001 and 2005</TIMEX>.

Labor to coordinate with similar efforts undertaken by other public
and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX>'s
outreach program, other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> also play a role in saving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
Investor Education and Assistance promotes financial literacy and
seeks to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to save wisely and plan for the
future. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aging</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FirstGov</ENAMEX> for Seniors also
provide information to educate the public about how they can better
prepare for a more financially secure retirement. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> launched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Partners</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Empowerment</ENAMEX>. This new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> planned to raise public
awareness about the importance of financial literacy and saving and
to help <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> develop the skills they need to take charge of
their financial future.
Education campaigns to promote financial literacy and retirement
saving represent a potentially valuable tool for encouraging people
to save more. Building on policymakers' efforts to enhance tax
incentives for retirement saving, education campaigns are a means
to convey easy-to-understand information about the variety of
saving vehicles available<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX> Efforts such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>'s saving outreach program can serve as a catalyst to educate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> about pension plan options they can offer to their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> as well as to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to save more on their
own behalf. Public education campaigns are one way to get people
started with retirement planning. The key steps are to calculate
how much income they need to retire, estimate how much retirement
income they can expect from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and employer-sponsored
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pensions</ENAMEX>, and decide how much more they need to save.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individualized Social Security</ENAMEX> statements now sent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> by

older provide important information for personal retirement
planning. The statement provides estimates of potential retirement,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disability</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> benefits. It also asks statement
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> to check their listed earnings to help correct errors

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, but further improvement is always possible<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38</NUMEX> For example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> may not understand that the "current dollar" estimates
provided reflect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s price level, not the price level that will
exist when they actually start to receive benefits. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Administration</ENAMEX> will need to continue to review and
streamline the statement to make it clearer and easier to
understand.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individualized Social Security</ENAMEX> statements also explain that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits were not intended to be the only source of
retirement income, and the statements encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to
supplement their benefits with pensions and personal saving. Once
they know their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits promised under current
law, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> can calculate how much they can expect from
employer-sponsored pension plans and how much they need to save on
their own for retirement<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.39</NUMEX> Knowing more about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s
financial status would help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to understand how to view their
personal benefit estimates. As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> benefits are projected to exceed the program's cash
revenue in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2016</TIMEX>, and the trust fund will be depleted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2038</TIMEX>. At
that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> revenue would only be sufficient to pay
for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 73 percent</NUMEX> of promised benefits. The individualized
statements disclose that, absent a change in the law, only a
portion of the benefits estimated may be payable. Knowing this can
help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> understand that some combination of revenue increases
and benefit reductions will be necessary to restore the program's
long-term solvency.

provide resources for capital formation and economic growth.
Prompt action is vital because economic growth is a long-term
process. A bigger economic pie would make it easier for future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to meet the dual challenges of paying for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX>'
retirement while achieving a rising standard of living for
themselves.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> as a whole, saving more means
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">forgoing</ENAMEX> consumption <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in order to consume more in the future.
However, this trade-off between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s consumption and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s
consumption is somewhat different for an individual than for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>. When an individual delays retirement saving, that
individual enjoys the additional consumption in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> and
then personally bears the burden of saving larger amounts later,
working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer</TIMEX>, or accepting a lower standard of living in
retirement. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s perspective, if current generations
forgo saving for their retirement costs, they also forgo investment
opportunities and the economic growth that would result. Therefore,
their saving choices affect not only their own retirement income
but also potentially affect the standard of living for future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. Greater economic growth from saving more now could
alleviate the burden that a slow-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> will bear in
producing the goods and services to be consumed by a society with a
large retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that consumes but does not work.
In other respects, saving for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s retirement costs is
analogous to an individual's retirement preparations. The sooner we
begin, the less we have to save per year and the greater our
benefit from compounding growth. The conventional measure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security solvency is gauged in terms of the actuarial balance of
the program's trust fund over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75-year</TIMEX> period. According to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Trustees</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> intermediate projections, restoring
the program's actuarial balance over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 75 years</TIMEX> would
require a combination of reform options equal to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.86 percent</NUMEX> of
taxable payroll. In simple terms, increasing payroll taxes by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.86</NUMEX>
percent (a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">15percent</NUMEX> increase over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2001</TIMEX> rate paid by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>) now could head off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> shortfall for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Delaying reform until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s insolvency is
imminent would necessitate drastic changes over a shorter period.
Absent reform, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2038</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> deficit would
require cutting benefits by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a quarter</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26 percent</NUMEX>) or raising
payroll taxes by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 percent</NUMEX>) just to restore balance
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restoring Social Security</ENAMEX>'s long-term solvency will require some
combination of increased revenues and reduced expenditures. Various
options are available within the current structure of the program
including raising the retirement age, reducing the cost-of-living
adjustment, altering the benefit formula, increasing payroll taxes,
and investing trust fund surpluses in higher-yielding assets. In
addition, some proposals would fundamentally alter the program
structure by setting up individual retirement accounts.
Before trying to explore how various reform options might affect
national saving, it is useful to highlight how the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> affects personal saving, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> trust
fund, and government saving.


•
Personal saving. As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Q1.5</ENAMEX>, some evidence
suggests that the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> may have reduced
personal saving. The retirement benefits promised under current law
reduce the amount <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believe they need to save on their own for
retirement. Although some may view their payroll tax contributions
as a form of retirement saving, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> need to understand that
their contributions are not deposited into interest-bearing
accounts for each individual but are largely used to finance
current benefits.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> trust fund. In the federal budget, a
"trust fund" is simply an accounting mechanism to record earmarked
receipts and expenditures<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.40</NUMEX> From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s perspective,
its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> cash surpluses are saved in the trust fund, and the
trust fund balance represents resources accumulated to help pay
future benefits. However, the accumulation and exhaustion of the
trust fund's balance does not reflect how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> finances
affect federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and national saving. The extent to which
cash surpluses "saved" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> trust fund translate
into increased national saving depends on federal saving as a
whole. Although the trust fund appears solvent until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2038</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> will begin dissaving at the point that program cash
deficits emerge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2016</TIMEX> (shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>).


•
Government saving. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1983</TIMEX> reforms
until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses partially offset a deficit in

government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">accounts</ENAMEX> within the unified budget<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.41</NUMEX> In effect,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses reduced the magnitude of government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissaving</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s need to borrow from the public.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, when the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> began running unified
surpluses, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policymakers</ENAMEX> appear to have agreed to using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security surpluses to reduce federal debt held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, and
these amounts would translate dollar-for-dollar into government
saving. When the trust fund begins running cash deficits in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2016</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> as a whole must come up with the cash to finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s cash deficit by reducing any projected non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security surpluses, borrowing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, raising other taxes,
or reducing other government spending. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Save the Social Security</ENAMEX>
Surpluses simulation illustrates the magnitude of fiscal challenges
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with our aging society. Absent reform, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
deficits would contribute to government dissaving (shown in figure
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.2</NUMEX>) and greatly constrain budgetary flexibility over the long run
(shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX>).
In evaluating reform proposals, it is important to consider
whether a reform package will truly increase national saving and
"grow the economic pie." From a macroeconomic perspective,
increasing the trust fund's balance, without underlying reform,
does nothing to enhance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s fiscal capacity to finance
future benefits. For example, crediting additional securities to
the trust fund or increasing the interest rate paid on the trust
fund's securities would commit additional future general revenue to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> program but does not increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
overall revenue or reduce its costs.
Reforms that reallocate the composition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s saving
and asset portfolio may serve only to redistribute the existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pie</ENAMEX>. For example, individual accounts-discussed more fully in
Q4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>-affect the contributions of government and personal saving
relative to national saving. Investing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses in
the stock market affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s asset holdings but does
not directly increase national saving. As we reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>,
potentially higher returns-albeit with greater risk-on the
government's stock holdings could boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s financing
and reduce the size of other revenue increases or benefit
41During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s
expenditures regularly exceeded revenues, causing a rapid decline
in the trust fund's balance and raising concerns about the
program's solvency. In response, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed reforms in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977 and 1983</TIMEX> that together were intended to assure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>'s solvency for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75-year</TIMEX> period.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-591SP <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Saving</ENAMEX>
reductions needed to restore solvency<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.42</NUMEX> Acquiring stocks or
other nonfederal financial assets would have approximately the same
effect on national saving as using the same amount of money to
reduce debt held by the public. If reducing federal debt held by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> is not an option, as discussed in text box <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX>,
investing in nonfederal financial assets on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> trust fund could be another way for government saving to
provide resources for private investment.
Most traditional reform options involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> paying more for
promised benefits or getting lower benefits. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, increasing payroll taxes or reducing benefits would
improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>'s finances and increase government
saving-assuming no other changes in government spending or taxes.
The ultimate effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> reform on national saving
depends on complex interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saving and
personal saving-both through pension funds and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> on
their own behalf. The way in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> is reformed will
influence both the magnitude and timing of any increase in national
saving. To illustrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> in evaluating how
traditional program reforms might affect national saving, let's
examine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic options that would directly improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>'s financial imbalance-increasing payroll taxes and
reducing benefits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">• Payroll</ENAMEX> tax increases. At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, increasing payroll
taxes appears to be a straightforward way to increase saving now to
take advantage of compounding growth. Payroll tax increases are
easy to implement and directly improve the trust fund's finances.
However, the extent to which payroll tax increases would translate
into increased government saving depends on whether the cash
generated by the payroll tax increase is used to finance new
spending or a general tax cut. Thus, increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses will not necessarily increase government saving. Even if
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saves all of the increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses, national saving would not increase dollar-for-dollar.
Changes in personal saving may counterbalance any increase in
government saving resulting from higher taxes. Higher payroll taxes
may depress personal saving to the extent that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> have less
disposable income to save. How <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> adjust their saving in
response to payroll tax increases may also depend on the form of
the increase.

Raising the payroll tax rate would affect all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> whereas
increasing the maximum taxable earning level would affect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">high-income earners</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">• Benefit</ENAMEX> reductions. Options reducing initial benefits or
raising the retirement age take time to implement or phase in,
allowing time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to adjust their retirement plans. Reducing
future benefits obviously reduces future spending for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security retirement benefits and stems government dissaving. At
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, reducing future benefits promised to current workers
would not seem to increase resources available to invest now.
However, changes in personal saving may complement any increase in
government saving resulting from benefit reductions. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security reform reduces anticipated retirement income, many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> might, to some degree, want to offset
this effect by increasing their saving outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
system. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> adjust their retirement plan to reflect benefit
reductions, increased personal saving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> could provide new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to invest. For example, raising the retirement age
reduces benefits and could induce some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to save more now
in order to retire before they are eligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>.
In evaluating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> reform proposal, it is important
to consider that increasing national saving is one criterion in
assessing the extent to which the proposal achieves sustainable
solvency. Beyond weighing how a proposal would affect the federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX> and the economy, policymakers need to consider the balance
struck between the twin goals of income adequacy (level and
certainty of benefits) and individual equity (rates of return on
individual contributions)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reform</ENAMEX> elements that could increase
national saving may not satisfy these adequacy and equity goals.
For example, benefit cuts, depending on how they are structured,
could leave those most reliant on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> with inadequate
retirement income. Also, increasing payroll taxes reduces the
implicit rate of return for future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX>. It is crucial to
evaluate the effects of an entire reform package considering
interactions between individual reform elements as well as how the
package as a whole achieves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policymakers</ENAMEX>' most important goals for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>.

Q4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>. How Would <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Establishing Individual</ENAMEX>
Accounts <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Affect National Saving</ENAMEX>?
A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>. Evaluating the potential effect of proposals to establish
individual accounts can be confusing. Various proposals have been
advanced that would create a new system of individual accounts as
part of comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> reform, while other proposals
would create new accounts outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>. Individual
account proposals also differ as to whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>'
participation would be mandatory or voluntary. As we have
previously reported, the extent to which individual accounts would
affect national saving depends on how they are financed, how the
program is structured, and how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> adjust their own saving
behavior in response to individual accounts<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX>
To understand how individual accounts might affect national
saving, it is necessary to examine the first-order effects
accounting for how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> might fund the accounts and then
to consider how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might adjust their saving in response to a
new account program.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important determinant of the effect on national saving is
the funding source for the individual accounts. Shifting funds from
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would affect the relative contributions of
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to national saving. For
instance, diverting funding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> trust
fund-such as a carve-out from current payroll taxes-would likely
reduce government saving by the same amount that the accounts
increase personal saving. Although national saving would be
unchanged, financing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> program- absent other
changes-would be worsened. If accounts are funded outside of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> using general revenues, the effect on
national saving is unclear and would depend on what would have been
done instead with the general funds.
• If the general funds would have been used to redeem federal
debt held by the public or acquire nonfederal financial assets,
national saving initially would be unchanged because personal
saving would increase by the amount that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saving
decreases. In a sense, individual accounts could serve as a way to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> saving through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> into resources for private
investment while avoiding issues associated with government
ownership of nonfederal assets.

•
If the general funds would have been spent on additional
government consumption, then any increase in personal saving due to
the individual accounts would represent an increase in national
saving. If the general funds would have been used for
infrastructure investment, national saving would be unchanged but
more funds would be available for private investment.


•
If the general funds would have been used for a general
tax cut, then national saving would initially increase because
personal saving would increase by the amount of individual accounts
whereas some portion of a tax cut would be consumed.


National saving also would be affected by how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and
businesses respond to individual accounts. Regardless of the
financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, the effect of individual accounts would be to
raise, at least to some extent, the level of personal saving unless
households fully offset the new accounts by reducing their other
saving. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Households</ENAMEX> for whom individual accounts closely resemble
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">401</NUMEX>(k)s and IRAs and who are currently saving as much as they
choose for retirement would probably reduce their own saving in the
presence of individual accounts. The extent of the behavioral
effects would depend in part on the structure of the individual
account program and any limits on accessing the funds. For
instance, mandatory account proposals are more likely to increase
private saving because such a program would require households that
do not currently save-such as many low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>-to place some amount in an individual account.
Prohibitions or restrictions on borrowing or other forms of
pre-retirement distributions could limit the ability of some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to reduce their other saving in response to individual
accounts. In addition to the effects on household saving choices,
individual accounts may also affect the relationship and
interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and private pensions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.45</NUMEX>

A4<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX>. As we have reported, the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program,
without improvements, is ill-suited to serve future generations of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.46 The program is fiscally unsustainable in its current
form, and growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending is expected to drive federal
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissaving</ENAMEX> over the long run. Despite this looming
financial problem, pressure is mounting to update <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s
outdated benefit design. Given the aging of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and
the increasing cost of modern medical technology, it is inevitable
that demands on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program will grow.
In addition to the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the increasing cost of
modern medical technology, the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program lacks
incentives to control health care consumption. The actual costs of
health care are not transparent, and third-party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payers</ENAMEX> generally
insulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> from the cost of health care decisions. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traditional Medicare</ENAMEX>, for example, the effect of cost-sharing
provisions designed to curb the use of services is muted because
many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> have some form of supplemental health
care coverage-such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medigap</ENAMEX> insurance-that pays these costs. For
these reasons, among others, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> presents a great fiscal
challenge over the long term.
In the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s fiscal health has generally been gauged
by the solvency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> trust fund projected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a 75-year</TIMEX>
period. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> trust fund is viewed as solvent through
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2029</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> outlays are predicted to exceed HI revenues beginning in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2016</TIMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trustees</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> intermediate
assumption, restoring the HI program's actuarial balance over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 75 years</TIMEX> would require a combination of reform options equal
to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.97 percent</NUMEX> of taxable payroll. In other words, averting a HI
shortfall for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75 years</TIMEX> now would require an increase in payroll
taxes by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.97 percent</NUMEX> (a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">68-percent</NUMEX> increase over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2001</TIMEX> rate
paid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">workers47</ENAMEX>), a cut in HI spending by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
percent, or some combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Actuary</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX>, the
estimated net present value of future additional resources needed
to fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> benefits alone over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 75 years</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.6 trillion</NUMEX>.

But, these estimates do not reflect the growing cost of the SMI
component, which accounts for somewhat <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending.
When viewed from the perspective of federal saving and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, the growth in total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending will be become
increasingly burdensome over the long run. According to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Trustees</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> intermediate estimates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> costs will
grow at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> percentage point above the growth in GDP per capita each
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.48 As shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>, total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending (Part A HI
and Part B SMI combined) is expected to consume <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> of GDP by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2035</TIMEX>-more than double <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s share of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2075</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
would consume <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 8 percent</NUMEX> of GDP, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trustees</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> intermediate estimates<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.49</NUMEX> Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Save the Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Surpluses simulation</ENAMEX>, federal health care spending will
greatly constrain budgetary flexibility (shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.3</NUMEX>).
Absent cost containment reforms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending would contribute
to federal dissaving over the long term even if the unified
surpluses projected over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX> are saved.
48These latest actuarial projections incorporate more realistic
assumptions about long-term health care spending, and as result,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending is expected to grow faster than previously
estimated. For further discussion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trustees</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>

Although future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> costs are expected to consume a growing
share of the federal budget and the economy, pressure is mounting
to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s benefit package to cover prescription drugs,
which will add billions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program costs. It is a given
that prescription drugs play a far greater role in health care now
than when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> was created. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> tend
to need and use more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> than other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. Overall, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s spending on prescription drugs has been increasing about
twice as fast as spending on other health care services, and it is
expected to keep growing. Adding a prescription drug benefit to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> will be costly, but the cost consequences ultimately
depend on choices about the benefit's scope and financing. Any
option to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s benefit package-absent other
reforms-runs the risk of exacerbating the program's fiscal
imbalance and increasing government dissaving. Any substantial
benefit reform should be coupled with adequate and effective cost
containment measures to avoid worsening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s long-range
financial condition.
Ultimately, we will need to look at broader health care reforms
to balance health care spending with other societal priorities. It
is important to note the fundamental differences between health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> wants, which are virtually unlimited; needs, which should be
defined and addressed; and overall affordability, which has a
limit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Realistically</ENAMEX>, reforms to address <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s huge long-range
financial imbalance will need to proceed incrementally. To avoid
more painful and disruptive changes once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX> begin
retiring, the time to begin these difficult but necessary steps is
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>.
Reform options that reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s growth rates or strengthen
the program's underlying sustainability would raise future levels
of government saving (assuming no other changes in government
spending and taxes). However, the effect of reduced federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending on national saving depends on how the private
sector responds to the reductions. For example, greater private
spending for elderly health care-by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> themselves or by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX>' behalf-could offset some
or all of the improvement in government saving in the short run.
Over time, personal saving could increase if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> choose to
save more to pay for health care in their old age.

National <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saving and Current Policy</ENAMEX> Issues
Q5<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. What Are Key Issues in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Evaluating</ENAMEX>
National Saving?
A5<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> is a steward for the economy it bequeaths
to future generations, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s long-term economic future
depends in part on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s decisions about consumption and saving.
The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has gone from the budget deficits of recent
decades to surplus as a result of a growing economy and difficult
decisions to reduce deficits . We appear-at least for the near

future-to have slain the deficit dragon. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s fiscal
good fortune will not survive over the long run. If the prospect of
surpluses over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</TIMEX> lulls us into complacency, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX> could face daunting demographic challenges without having
changed the path of programs for the elderly or having built the
economic capacity to bear the costs of the programs as currently
structured.
Economic growth will help society bear the burden of financing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, but it alone will not solve the
long-term fiscal challenge. Increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s economic
capacity is a long-term process. Thus, saving now and making
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meaningful Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> reform sooner rather than
later are important. Because every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> is in part
responsible for the economy it passes on to the next, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s
fiscal policy choices must be informed by the long-term. Common
sense tells us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> needs to save more when it has a
healthy economy, sufficient resources to meet some current needs
while still building our capacity for the future, and a relatively
large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. National saving pays future dividends-but we need
to begin soon to permit compounding to work for us.
From a macroeconomic perspective, it does not matter who does
the saving-any mix of increased saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would help to grow the economic pie. Yet, in light
of the virtual disappearance of personal saving, concerns about
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> reliance on borrowing from abroad to finance domestic
investment, and the looming fiscal pressures of an aging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, now is an opportune time for the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to
save some portion of its anticipated budget surpluses. Higher
federal saving-to the extent that the increased government saving
is not offset by reduced private saving-would increase national
saving and tend to improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s current account balance,
although typically not on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
In considering how much of the anticipated budget surpluses to
save, policy choices must balance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s unmet needs and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s fiscal challenges. Saving the surpluses would allow the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to reduce the debt overhang from past deficit
spending and enhance future budgetary flexibility. Choices about
federal spending for infrastructure, education, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R&D</ENAMEX> as well
as tax incentives for private saving and investment also have
implications for future economic growth.
Increased government saving and entitlement reform go
hand-in-hand. Over the long term, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> cannot
avoid massive dissaving without reforming retirement and health
programs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>. Increasing national saving and thus
long-term economic growth is crucial to the long-term sustainable
solvency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>. Since the economy
provides the tax base for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, economic growth increases
government revenue, which helps finance these programs as well as
other federal programs and activities, and increases budget
flexibility. But saving and economic growth alone cannot solve the
looming demographic challenges. Saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses-and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> surpluses-is not enough by itself
to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s commitments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>. Program
reform is needed as well, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> will
constitute a heavy drain on the earnings of future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. In a
sense, saving more yields a bigger pie, but policymakers will still
face the difficult choice of how to divide the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.
The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can also undertake steps to encourage
personal saving. Saving education campaigns are one tool to
encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to save more for their own retirement. To
participate in the debate over how to reform <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, the public needs to understand the difficult choices the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> faces. Announcing any benefits changes sooner rather than
later would make it easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to plan for retirement
and to adjust their saving behavior accordingly. The federal
government can explore how to design tax incentives that induce
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> to save enough to make up for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s revenue
loss and the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> saving that would result.

Personal Saving, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Household Wealth</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retirement Security</ENAMEX>
This report is designed to present information about national
saving and its implications for economic growth and retirement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>. Specifically, this report addresses the following
questions: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) What is personal saving, how is it related to
national saving, and what are the implications of low personal
saving for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' retirement security? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) What is national
saving and how does current saving in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> compare to
historical trends and saving in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) How does
national saving affect the economy and how would higher saving
affect the longterm outlook? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) How does federal fiscal policy
affect national saving, what federal policies have been aimed at
increasing private saving, and how would <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> reform affect national saving? And, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) what are key
issues in evaluating national saving?
Because this report focuses on the macroeconomic implications of
saving and investment, we used saving data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Income</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Product Accounts</ENAMEX> (NIPA) compiled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Economic</ENAMEX>
Analysis (BEA)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> This report presents the trend in the personal
saving rate as measured on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> basis. As a comparison point, we
also examined an alternative personal saving rate available from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flow of Funds Accounts</ENAMEX> (FFA)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> Because FFA
counts household purchases of consumer durables as saving, the FFA
personal saving rate is somewhat higher than the NIPA personal
saving rate but also shows a downward trend. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> and FFA
measures focus on saving as a flow from the economy's current
production and do not include changes in the market value of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>' existing portfolios. For information about the stock of
wealth accumulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, we obtained net worth data from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFAs</ENAMEX>' balance sheet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aggregated</ENAMEX> for the household sector. In

Fully exploring the dynamics of personal saving behavior and
gauging the adequacy of retirement saving are beyond the scope of
this national saving report. The literature attempting to explain
why and how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save-or do not save as the case may be-is
extensive, and the empirical research is conflicting. For this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, we provide an overview of the major theories about why
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save and describe various factors associated with the
decline in personal saving. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix IV</ENAMEX> lists the major references
used in preparing this report.
For demographic trends and the financial outlook for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Hospital Insurance</ENAMEX> programs, we used the
intermediate actuarial projections, which reflect the best estimate
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Boards of Trustees</ENAMEX>. We also
examined income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and amounts for those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 65</TIMEX> and older
using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Administration</ENAMEX>'s Income of the

We also used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NIPA</ENAMEX> data to describe historical trends in (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
national saving by component, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) domestic and foreign investment

trends over the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>-from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960 to 2000</TIMEX>. We also compared
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> national saving to the saving of other major industrialized

Our national saving trend analysis is based on current NIPA
definitions of saving and investment. We also examined literature
that presents other ways of thinking about national saving. For
example, a broader saving and investment measure might encompass
spending on education as well as research and development. These
are not included in the conventional NIPA measures but are related
to long-term productive capacity.
We used our long-term economic growth model to simulate
alternative fiscal policies and national saving rates. Long-term
simulations are useful for comparing the potential outcomes of
alternative saving rates within a common economic framework. Such
simulations can help policymakers assess the long-term consequences
of fiscal policy and saving choices made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
While long-term simulations provide a useful perspective, they
should be interpreted carefully. Given the range of uncertainty
about future economic changes and the responses to those changes,
the simulation results should not be viewed as forecasts of
budgetary or economic outcomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 or 75 years</TIMEX> in the future.
Rather, they should be seen only as illustrations of the different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX> and economic outcomes associated with alternative fiscal
policy and saving paths based on common demographic and economic
assumptions.
In our simulations, we used a model originally developed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</ENAMEX> that relates
long-term economic growth-measured in terms of gross domestic
product (GDP)-to economic and budget factors. The key interaction
between the budget and the economy is the effect of the federal
deficit/surplus on the amount of national saving available for
investment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conversely</ENAMEX>, the rate of economic growth helps
determine the overall federal surplus or deficit through its effect
on federal revenue and spending. In our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, the level of
national saving affects investment and, in turn, GDP growth.

In general, federal deficits measured on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> basis represent
dissaving-they subtract from national saving by absorbing
nonfederal funds that otherwise would be used for investment.
Conversely, federal surpluses add to national saving. While the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> measure of government saving directly affects national saving,
the unified budget measure is the more common frame of reference
for discussing federal fiscal policy issues. Our simulation results
reflect unified budget deficits/surpluses.
Our simulations are based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX>'s

all promised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits are paid even after the
projected exhaustion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDI Trust Funds</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2038</TIMEX>). For
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> in the out-years, we used the growth rates from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX> long-term analysis<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> Interest spending is determined
by interest rates-which are held constant over the long-term-and
the level of federal debt held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, which depends on the
path of budget deficits/surpluses within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each simulation</TIMEX>. All other
spending as well as federal revenue are assumed to grow at
essentially the same rate as the economy. In other words, other
spending and revenue both remain constant as shares of GDP.

Surpluses simulation assumes that only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
surpluses are saved and used to reduce federal debt held by the
public. Unspecified policy actions-spending increases and/or tax
cuts-are taken that eliminate the non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> surpluses
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. These unspecified policy actions are left in place
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the simulation</TIMEX> period. For simplicity, we
assumed nonfederal saving-saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and
state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>-would remain constant as a share of GDP
in both fiscal policy simulations.
As a reference point, we also simulated a path assuming that
national saving remains constant at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.3 percent</NUMEX>
of GDP. The Constant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">National Saving Rate simulation</ENAMEX> reflects
an unspecified mix of saving by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and all
levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. To provide a useful perspective on how
alternative levels of national saving affect future living
standards, we also compared our simulation results to a historical
benchmark. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, GDP per capita has doubled about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 35 years</TIMEX>. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, annual growth in GDP per capita
has averaged roughly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX>. Of course, growth was faster during
some periods-the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950s and 1960s</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half</TIMEX> of the
1990s-and slower during other periods-the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</TIMEX>. Doubling GDP per
capita every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 years</TIMEX> represents a way to gauge whether future
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> will enjoy a rise in living standards comparable to
that enjoyed by previous generations.
While this report discusses the potential consequences of
alternative saving paths, it does not suggest any particular course
of action. The choice of the most appropriate fiscal policy path is
a policy decision to be made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>.
While fiscal policy is the most direct way to increase national
saving, how much the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> saves also depends on the saving
choices of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> II
The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Economic Model</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Key Assumptions</ENAMEX>
In this report, we simulated the effect of different saving
rates on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s standard of living using a standard model of
economic growth originally developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Bank of New York</ENAMEX>. The major determinants of economic growth
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are changes in the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, capital formation, and
the growth in total factor productivity. To analyze the effect of
fiscal policy on saving and growth, we modified the original model
to include a set of relationships that describe the federal budget
and its links to the economy, using the framework of the National
Income and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Product Accounts</ENAMEX> (NIPA). To isolate the effect of
changes in saving on growth, we varied the saving rate while using
the same assumptions for the growth in the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and total
factor productivity.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is helpful for exploring the long-term implications of
national saving and fiscal policy and for comparing alternative
paths within a common economic framework. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has
provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> with a long-term perspective on alternative
fiscal policy paths<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> The results provide illustrations rather than
precise forecasts of the economic outcomes associated with
alternative policy or saving rate assumptions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> depicts
the links between saving and the economy over the long term and
does not reflect their interrelationships during short-term
business cycles. We have made several simplifying assumptions such
as holding interest rates and total factor productivity growth
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>, but sensitivity analyses suggest that variations in these
assumptions generally would not affect the relative outcomes of
alternative policies. These simulations are not predictions of what
will happen in the future as policymakers would likely take action
to prevent damaging out-year fiscal and economic consequences.
Overview of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model</ENAMEX> In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, GDP is
determined by the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, capital stock, and total factor

consists of the saving of the private sector and state and local
government surpluses or deficits. Through its effects on federal
revenues and spending, GDP also helps determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NIPA</ENAMEX> federal
budget surplus or deficit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonfederal</ENAMEX> and federal saving together
compose national saving, which influences investment and the next
period's capital stock. Capital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">combines</ENAMEX> with labor and total
factor productivity to determine GDP in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next period</TIMEX>, and the
process continues.
The model allows us to focus on the contribution of national
saving to output and living standards through the linkage between
saving and the capital stock. In particular, the model provides a
useful framework for assessing the long-term implications of
alternative budget policies through their effect on national
saving. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> does not differentiate between tax policy changes
and spending changes. The aggregate effect on the amount of federal
government saving is what affects the level of national saving and
economic growth. Federal surpluses increase national saving while
deficits reduce national saving, and higher saving translates into
higher GDP. Higher GDP in turn lessens the share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
output dedicated to government transfer programs in our modeling
because we use a simplifying assumption that such programs do not
simply keep pace with overall economic growth<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>
In our simulations, we make the simplifying assumption that the
combined saving rate of the household, business, and state and
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> sectors will remain constant throughout the
simulation period at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16.1 percent</NUMEX> of GDP-average nonfederal saving
as a share of GDP since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1998.3</NUMEX> Future saving rates of these sectors
will of course vary in response to a variety of influences, such as
demographics, expectations, and changes in preferences.
Nonetheless, this simplifying assumption allows us to assess the
effect of budget policy on saving, investment, and output in the
future.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Input Economic</ENAMEX> growth is partly
dependent on how much labor is employed. In our simulations, we
used the labor input assumptions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>

2A more sophisticated approach would be to model the feedbacks
between the economy and government transfer programs because
economic growth tends to increase health spending and raise
retirement benefits-although with a lengthy lag for the latter.

The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of economic growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> are increased
labor input, capital accumulation, and the advance of total factor

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of growth not captured in straightforward measures of
aggregate labor input and aggregate physical capital employed.
These include not only the improvements in products and processes
yielded by advancing technology but also the improved quality of
labor and capital inputs, reallocation of inputs to uses where they
are more productive, and improvements in physical and social
infrastructure.
Our simulations assume that total factor productivity growth in

our long-term assumption between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trustees</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s current
long-term assumptions.
There are also important links between national saving and
investment and the international sector. In an open economy such as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, an increase in saving due to, for example, an
increase in the federal budget surplus may not result in an
equivalent increase in domestic investment. Instead, part of the
increased saving may flow abroad in the form of an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
net foreign investment. The income earned on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-owned foreign
assets adds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s income (GNP). The portion of an
increase in national saving used for domestic investment adds to
the capital stock available for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to produce goods and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (GDP).
The model incorporates a simple representation of net financial
flows between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy and the rest of the world.
Essentially the rest of the world is treated as analogous to a bank
where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> can make deposits or withdrawals or draw on
a credit line. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX> there are income flows to or from this
bank corresponding to interest received on deposits or paid on
advances. The amount corresponding to the bank balance (positive or
negative) is called the net international investment position
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIIP</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, which generates a net flow of income
receipts.
A key model assumption affecting international flows is the
allocation of gross saving between its foreign and domestic
investment uses. Over the long run, we assume that market forces
such as adjustments in exchange rates, interest rates, and prices
will tend to move net foreign investment and the current account
balance towards <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. To reflect this tendency to move towards
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equilibrium</ENAMEX>, we hold net foreign investment constant at the nominal
dollar level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. This reduces the ratio of net foreign
investment to GDP over time as GDP grows. Changes in national
saving cause the ratio of net foreign investment to GDP to move
around its longterm trend. We assume that net foreign investment
rises by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of any increase in the national saving rate.
Basically, for each additional dollar saved, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 66.6 cents</NUMEX> are
used for domestic investment and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33.3 cents</NUMEX> are invested abroad.
Conversely, each dollar decrease in national saving is offset by
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33.3 cents</NUMEX> in foreign investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> and Other Assumptions
assumption is consistent with the strong correlation between
national saving and domestic investment that persists even in the
context of a global
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>.
This is a highly stylized representation of the foreign sector
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> country in isolation. A more sophisticated approach would be
to model a changing international environment in detail. A more
detailed approach would confront major uncertainties concerning the
actual course of world economic development, exchange rates, and
rates of return.
Table II.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> lists the key assumptions incorporated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
Several of the assumptions used tend to provide conservative
estimates of the benefit of running surpluses or lower deficits and
of the harm of increasing deficits. The interest rate on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> debt is held constant, for example, even when deficits
climb and the national saving rate plummets. Under such conditions,
the more likely result would be a rise in the rate of interest and
a more rapid increase in federal interest payments than our
simulations display. Another conservative assumption is that the
rate of total factor productivity growth is unaffected by the
amount of investment. Productivity is assumed to advance <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
percent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the simulation period</TIMEX> even if
investment collapses. Finally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of any saving decline is
assumed to be offset by net inflows of foreign capital, even in the
event of a dramatic saving decline that might set off a flight of
capital from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Such assumptions tend to moderate
the effect of changes in national saving in our simulations.
Sensitivity analyses reveal that variations in these assumptions
generally would not affect the relative outcomes of alternative
policies.

Note <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: These assumptions apply to our base simulation, Save the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unified Surpluses</ENAMEX>. For alternative fiscal policy simulations,
certain assumptions are varied, as discussed in the alternative
paths.
Note <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>: In our work, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> budget projections were converted
from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a fiscal year to a calendar year</TIMEX> basis. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s
projection period is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2011</TIMEX>, permitting the calculations
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">calendar year</TIMEX> values through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>.
Our Save the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Unified Surpluses</ENAMEX> base simulation reflects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 20017</TIMEX> assumption that discretionary spending increases at
the rate of inflation over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10-year</TIMEX> budget projection period<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>
After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, we assumed discretionary spending would grow at the
same rate as GDP. As a

8In our modeling, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> budget projections were converted from
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year to a calendar year</TIMEX> basis. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s
projection period was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2011</TIMEX>, permitting the calculation of calendar

result, discretionary spending stays the same as share of GDP
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 2011 through the end of the</TIMEX> projection period<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>
Mandatory spending includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Old-Age</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Survivors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disability</ENAMEX>
Insurance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDI</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>), and a residual category covering other mandatory
spending. The long-term OASDI spending path reflects the
intermediate projections of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">OASDI Trustees</ENAMEX>' Report<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>
Long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> spending reflects the intermediate projections
of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> HI and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI Trustees Reports</ENAMEX>;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> the long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>
spending path reflects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX> long-term projections<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX>
We assume that current-law benefits are paid in full even after the
projected exhaustion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI Trust Funds</ENAMEX>.
Other mandatory spending is a residual category consisting of
all non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, nonhealth mandatory spending. It is
equivalent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> projection for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transfers</ENAMEX>, Grants, and
Subsidies less <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDI</ENAMEX>, and other discretionary spending.
Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> assumptions are the main determinant of other
mandatory spending, after which it grows at the same rate as
GDP.
In our Save the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Unified Surpluses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base simulation</ENAMEX>, receipts
follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s dollar projections through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. Thereafter, receipts
remain at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.2 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s simulated GDP on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIPA</ENAMEX> basis,
which is the rate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> projects for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>. On a unified budget
basis, revenues remain at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20.4 percent</NUMEX> of GDP after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>.
9If spending were to keep pace with population growth and
inflation over the long term, discretionary spending would
generally grow slower than the economy and the long-term budget
surplus/deficit would be improved. For example, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical</ENAMEX>
Perspectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Budget of the United States Government</ENAMEX>: Fiscal Year
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management</ENAMEX> and

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurance Trust Fund</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2001</TIMEX>).
12CBO's long-term health care cost growth assumptions are
generally consistent with those in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trustees</ENAMEX>'
Reports. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Trustees</ENAMEX> generally assume
per-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> costs to grow at GDP per capita plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> percentage
point over the long-term. See The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long-Term Budget Outlook</ENAMEX>,
Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget Office</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>) and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> HI and SMI
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trustees Reports</ENAMEX>.
Our interest rate assumption for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 through 2005</TIMEX> is consistent
with the average rate on the debt held by the public implied by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX>'s interest payment projections in its baseline. To avoid the
substantial volatility in the implied interest rate after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> as a
result of declining debt, interest rates are held constant at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.4</NUMEX>
percent-the average interest rate assumed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> on short- and
long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities-from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX> through the end of the
simulation period. This interest rate is both paid on outstanding
debt held by the public and earned on nonfederal financial assets
acquired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> once debt held by the public is
eliminated<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>
Our simulation period-from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000 through 2075</TIMEX>-coincides with the
75year period used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Trustees' Report</ENAMEX> where
actuaries calculate trust fund solvency over a long-term horizon
that is at least as long as an individual's working life.
Because our model assumptions are based on current budget
projections and recent long-term actuarial projections for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, our current model assumptions differ
somewhat from those used in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> reports. Also, these
simulations reflect discretionary spending growing with inflation
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>; in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> reports, discretionary spending was
assumed to comply with statutory caps in effect through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>. As a
result, these simulation results should not be compared directly to
those in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> reports.
13Under this interest rate assumption, the level of net interest
payments and net debt would be the same if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> began
acquiring nonfederal financial assets before debt held by the
public was eliminated.
