Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(A) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>,
this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Commission</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>), entitled "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Service and Auction</ENAMEX>
Rules for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38.6</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GHz Frequency Band</ENAMEX>" (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ET</TIMEX> Docket No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95-183</NUMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP Docket</ENAMEX> No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93-253</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-391</NUMEX>). We received the rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 1998</TIMEX>. It was published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> as a final rule

The final rule amends the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s rules to facilitate more
effective use of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> GHz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> by implementing a number of
improvements, such as licensing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basic Trading Areas</ENAMEX> and
employing competitive bidding procedures as a means for choosing
among mutually exclusive license <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>. In addition, the
regulatory framework for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> GHz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> is expanded to include
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">service</ENAMEX> rules for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> which, in the view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>,
will promote competition by increasing both the diversity of
potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> offerings and the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> that can
offer any service.
