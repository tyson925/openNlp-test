Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(A) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>,
this is our report on major rules promulgated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX>;

Administration; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments</ENAMEX>) entitled,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interim Rules for Health Insurance Portability for Group Health</ENAMEX>
Plans" (RIN: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1545-AV05, 1210-AA54</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0938-AI08</TIMEX>). We received the
rules on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 9, 1997</TIMEX>. The rules were published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register</ENAMEX> as interim rules with request for comments on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 8</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16894</NUMEX>.
The interim rules govern access, portability, and renewability
requirements for group health plans and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">issuers</ENAMEX> of health insurance
coverage in connection with a group health plan. The rules
implement changes in the provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Code of</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974</ENAMEX> (ERISA),
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health</ENAMEX> Service Act which were enacted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>
Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Portability and Accountability Act of 1996</ENAMEX> (HIPAA).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> market provisions of HIPAA create concurrent
jurisdiction for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secretaries of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> and include rules relating to preexisting
conditions exclusions, special enrollment rights, and prohibition
of discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> based on health statusrelated
factors. The shared group market provisions in each of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX>'s rule, except as noted in the preamble, are
substantially identical.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enclosed</ENAMEX> is our assessment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX>' compliance with
the procedural steps required by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)(i) through
(iv) of title <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> with respect to the rules. Our review indicates
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> complied with the applicable requirements.

(i) Cost-benefit analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> have prepared a combined economic impact
analysis for this interim final rule and the interim final rule
issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>, and
published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>, concerning
individual market provisions because the effects of the reforms and
burdens imposed overlap the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">issuers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">16908-16920</ENAMEX>.
For group health plans coverage under these rules, the
Departments cite estimates formulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget</ENAMEX>
Office which shows the initial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> cost (direct cost to the
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>) to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50 million</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> covered and
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subsequent years</TIMEX> for limiting the length of
preexisting conditions exclusions to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>. For creditable
coverage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBO</ENAMEX> estimate is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> per year thereafter.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>
Since the rules were issued as interim final rules and not as
general notices of proposed rulemaking, the rules are not subject
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX>, in the
preamble, invite comments regarding the impact of the rules on
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and ways to minimize that impact.
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532-1535</TIMEX>
Since the rules were issued as interim final rules and not as
general notices of proposed rulemaking, the rules are not subject
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</ENAMEX>. However, the
Departments point out that the rules have been designed to be the
least burdensome alternative for state, local, and tribal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> met and consulted with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-39</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, including state insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commissions</ENAMEX>, in drafting
the rules to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> considerable flexibility in complying
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIPAA</ENAMEX>.
(iv) Other relevant information or requirements under acts and
executive orders
Administrative Procedure <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">551 et seq.</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 707 of ERISA, Section 9806</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue</ENAMEX> code,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 2707</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health</ENAMEX> Service Act provide that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretaries</ENAMEX> may promulgate any interim final rules determined to be
appropriate to carry out the provisions of Part B of the act. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretaries</ENAMEX> have determined that there is good cause under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">553</NUMEX>(b) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Administrative Procedure Act</ENAMEX> to not issue a notice of
proposed rulemaking because it would be impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to the public interest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretaries</ENAMEX> have found that
without prompt guidance, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the regulated community
would have difficulty complying with the requirements of the HIPAA
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured individuals</ENAMEX> will not understand the benefit to them of
having a certificate of prior coverage to present upon entering the
individual health insurance market.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> are accepting comments on the interim
final rule for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> period for consideration in the development
of the final rules to be issued implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIPAA</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3501-3520</TIMEX>
The interim final rules contain information collections subject
to review and approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> under
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> have requested emergency review of the
collections because the collection of the information is needed
before the expiration of the normal time limits of the act to
assure guaranteeing availability of individual health insurance
coverage to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with prior group coverage. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments</ENAMEX> are requesting that OMB provide a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> comment period
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> approval by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1, 1997</TIMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 180-day</TIMEX> period. During the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">180-day</TIMEX> period, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> will publish a notice in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> initiating a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> agency review and public
comment period with submittal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> for review and an extension of
the emergency approval to follow.
The notice contained in the preamble to the interim final rule
complies with the requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> by
explaining the need for the information, the parties affected, and
the burden estimates related to the collections by each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX>.

The interim rules were found to be "economically significant"
regulatory actions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Order No. 12866</ENAMEX>. As such,

describing the reason for the rules and an assessment of the costs
and budgetary impact of the rules. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> approved the rules on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 1997</TIMEX>.
