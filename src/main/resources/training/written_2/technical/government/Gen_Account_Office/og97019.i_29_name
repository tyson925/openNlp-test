Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(A) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>,
this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Commission</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>), entitled "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unlicensed NII Devices</ENAMEX>
in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 GHz</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Frequency Range</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ET Docket No. 96102</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-5</NUMEX>). We
received the rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 31, 1997</TIMEX>. It was published in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> as a final rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 31, 1997</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4649</TIMEX>.
The final rule makes available <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> megahertz of spectrum at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.15</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GHz</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.725</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.825</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GHz</ENAMEX> for use by a new category of
unlicensed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">equipment</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unlicensed National Information</ENAMEX>
Infrastructure (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-NII</ENAMEX>) devices. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-NII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">devices</ENAMEX> will provide
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">short-range</ENAMEX>, high speed wireless digital communications on an
unlicensed basis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> anticipates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-NII</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">devices</ENAMEX> will
support the creation of new wireless local area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and will
facilitate wireless access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Information</ENAMEX>
Infrastructure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enclosed</ENAMEX> is our assessment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s compliance with the
procedural steps required by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)(i) through (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>)

(i)
Cost-benefit analysis

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> stated in its submission to us that it was not required
to prepare and did not prepare a cost-benefit analysis of the
rule.


(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
Act, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 603</ENAMEX>: Initial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
The proposed rulemaking, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24750</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 16, 1996</TIMEX>),
incorporated an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the
expected impact on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
The analysis provides the information required by paragraphs
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) through (b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>). It describes the reasons for the proposed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> action, and its objectives and legal basis. It also
describes the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> (radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> of
radio equipment) to which the proposed rule will apply. It states
that there are no reporting or recordkeeping requirements and that
the rule does not overlap, duplicate, or conflict with any other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX> rules. Finally, the analysis states that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> is unaware
of any other alternatives which could provide sufficient spectrum
in the immediate future but invites comments on this point.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 604</ENAMEX>: Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
The preamble to the final rule contains the full text of the
Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4652</TIMEX>. This
analysis includes the information required by paragraph 604(a) by
summarizing and evaluating comments received.
Based on comments which contend that making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX> megahertz (as
proposed) available would interfere with the interests of incumbent
or future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile satellite</ENAMEX> service and amateur
radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> concludes that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> megahertz is appropriate
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-NII devices to operate. Additionally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> did not
adopt "safe harbor" rules at this time, as suggested by some
commenters, to avoid interference. However, the situation will be
monitored and if interference problems do arise, the "safe harbor"
issue will be addressed in future rulemaking.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-19</NUMEX>
The analysis uses both quantifiable and general descriptions of
the effects of the rule on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and to assist in the
participation of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> in the rulemaking, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> made
available a complete copy of the proposed and final rulemaking
materials via the Internet.
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the

responds to the concerns expressed in the comments, especially
those comments from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incumbent</ENAMEX> and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the spectrum
regarding the feasibility of spectrum sharing between the new
unlicensed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">devices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incumbent</ENAMEX> and proposed primary services, in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> and Order. These responses are summarized in the
preamble to the rule in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>.
