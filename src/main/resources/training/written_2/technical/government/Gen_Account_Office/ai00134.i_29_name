Preface
To help promote effective implementation of federal financial
management reform, we studied the financial management practices
and improvement efforts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private sector
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to identify the success factors, practices,
and outcomes associated with worldclass financial management. This
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is intended to assist federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in achieving
the objectives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> (CFO) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>
and subsequent related legislation by providing case studies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
practices critical for establishing and maintaining sound financial
operations.
The reforms laid out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> and subsequent related
legislation, when effectively implemented, will place the federal
government on par with private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and state and
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> that have already made the necessary investment
in financial management. While many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have made great
strides toward generating more accurate and reliable annual
financial statements, the process of preparing financial statements
and subjecting them to independent audit is only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step
toward satisfying the requirements of the legislation. To reap the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> benefits of financial reform, federal finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
must go beyond the audit opinion toward
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) establishing seamless systems and processes, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) routinely
generating reliable cost and performance information and analysis,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) undertaking other valueadded activities that support strategic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisionmaking</ENAMEX> and mission performance, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) building a finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> that supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s mission and goals.
This executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> was prepared under the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lisa G.</ENAMEX>

Background
Learning from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leading Organizations</ENAMEX>



Background
Creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that runs more efficiently and effectively
has been a public concern for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, however,
the push towards creating a smaller, more results oriented
government has intensified the urgency to find ways to do more with
less. To effectively evaluate and improve the value derived from
government programs and spending, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and other
decisionmakers must have accurate and reliable financial
information on program cost and performance. Further, they must be
able to rely on federal finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to provide analysis
and insight about the financial implications of program decisions
and the impact of those decisions on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> performance goals and
objectives. Currently, financial data are not always useful,
relevant, timely, and reliable enough to be used for federal
decisionmaking, and many federal finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are not yet
well equipped enough to routinely provide analysis or advice
related to this information.
In the private sector, the role of the finance organization
historically has centered on oversight and control, focusing on its
fiduciary responsibilities and paying less attention to increasing
the effectiveness of operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>. However, over the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>, dramatic changes in the business environment have driven
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to reevaluate this role. Increased
competition resulting from an emerging global market has put
pressure on finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to find new ways to reduce
administrative costs, add value, and provide a competitive
advantage. At the same time, advances in information technology
have made it possible for the finance function to shift from a
paperdriven, labor intensive, clerical role to a more consultative
role as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>, and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>.
According to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> study performed by a major public accounting
firm<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX> most CFOs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> were spending <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 to 80 percent</NUMEX> of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> on fiduciary issues, essentially external reporting. Today,
the goal of many leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> is to spend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX>
percent of their time on fiduciary issues and the remaining time
performing strategic support activities, such as cost analysis or
business performance analysis. Also, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Institute</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Accountants</ENAMEX> found that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 5 to 10</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> were increasingly being asked to
supplement their traditional accounting role with more financial
analysis and management consulting<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>
Dramatic changes also have occurred in federal financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in response to the most comprehensive management reform
legislation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 40 years</TIMEX>. The combination of reforms
ushered in by (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act of 1990</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
Management <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reform Act</ENAMEX> (GMRA) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial</ENAMEX>
Management <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Improvement Act</ENAMEX> (FFMIA) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
Performance and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Results Act</ENAMEX> (GPRA) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ClingerCohen Act of 1996</ENAMEX> will, if successfully implemented, provide
the necessary foundation to run an effective, resultsoriented
government.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMRA</ENAMEX> spelled out a long overdue and ambitious
agenda to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> remedy its lack of useful, relevant,
timely, and reliable financial information. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, this legislation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) established
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX> positions,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) required audited financial statements <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) set
expectations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to develop and deploy more modern
financial management systems, produce sound cost and operating
performance information, and design results oriented reports on the
government's financial condition by integrating budget, accounting,
and program information. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFMIA</ENAMEX> built on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMRA</ENAMEX> by
requiring financial statement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to report whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>'
financial systems comply with federal financial management systems
requirements, federal accounting standards, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Government</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard General Ledger</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Performance and Results Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993commonly</TIMEX> know
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Results Actwas</ENAMEX> enacted to hold federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
accountable for achieving program results. It requires that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multiyear</TIMEX> strategic goals and corresponding annual
goals, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) measure performance toward the achievement of those
goals, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) report on their progress. Effective implementation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Results Act</ENAMEX>, however, hinges on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' ability to
routinely produce meaningful budget, accounting, and program
information needed to manage performance and measure results. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> and other related financial reform legislation, if
successfully implemented, will provide the basis for producing this
information.
To help insure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> effectively use information
technology to achieve program results, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ClingerCohen Act of 1996</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ClingerCohen Act</ENAMEX> builds on the best
practices of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> by
requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to better link their information technology
planning and investment decisions to program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and goals.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ClingerCohen Act</ENAMEX> contains critical provisions requiring federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to use investment and capital planning processes to manage
their information management technology portfolios. Further, it
requires that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> modernize inefficient administrative and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">missionrelated</ENAMEX> work processes before making significant technology
investments to support them.
Implemented together, these measures provide a basis for
improving accountability over government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and routinely
producing sound cost and operating performance information, thereby
making it possible to better assess and improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
financial condition and operating performance.



Learning From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leading Organizations</ENAMEX>
To help promote effective implementation of federal financial
management reform, we studied the financial management practices
and improvement efforts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> leading private and public sector
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to identify the success factors, practices,
and outcomes associated with worldclass financial management. The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> private sector and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied have
been recognized by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> and other independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
for their outstanding financial management practices and successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> reengineering efforts. For more information on the criteria
we used to select these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, see appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> As federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> continue to improve their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and financial
accountability, they will be able to draw upon the expertise and
experience of these private sector and state government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.

Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Organizations</ENAMEX>

At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, all of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> found themselves in an
environment similar to the one confronting federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">todayone</ENAMEX> in which they were called upon to improve financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> while simultaneously reducing costs. The key practices
drawn from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we examined can provide a useful
framework for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> working to improve their financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. This guide discusses the goals, success factors, and
practices associated with building a worldclass finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. Specifically, we have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> overall goals
common to these leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> practices that
were critical to their ability to meet these goals. In addition,
this guide includes examples from our case study work that best
illustrate how each practice enabled the selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to
achieve the desired outcomes.
We preceded our case study work with an extensive review of
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> literature, guides, and reports. We also
consulted with leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Case study data were collected through
interviews and analysis of documentation. Further, the case study
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> reviewed all case study information included in this
guide for accuracy and completeness. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix I</ENAMEX> provides a more
detailed description of our research objectives, scope, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX>.

Characteristics of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldclass Finance Organization</ENAMEX>
A worldclass finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> can best be defined in terms
of the business outcomes it producesoutcomes such as improved
business analysis, innovative solutions to business problems,
reduced operating costs, increased capability to perform adhoc
analysis, and improved overall business performance. To build a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldclass</ENAMEX> finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and help achieve better business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>, each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we examined set an agenda for
transforming the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> by defining a " shared
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX>" -i.e., a mission, a vision for the future, core values,
goals, and strategies- geared toward making the finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> a valuecreating, customerfocused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in business
results. Although the techniques used varied depending on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s size and culture and some efforts were more mature
than others, the goals, practices, and success factors outlined in
the following illustration were instrumental in the organization
achieving its vision.



Goals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Practices</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategies</ENAMEX> To Consider
This section summarizes the results of our research and case
study work. Specifically, it contains the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> overall goals and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
practices we identified as critical for building a worldclass
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. To facilitate the practical use of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX>, information is organized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sections-each summarizing
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> goals as well as those practices that have enabled
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to achieve these goals. Further, for each of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> practices, we provided (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a summary of key characteristics,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) illustrative case study examples, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) strategies for
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to consider when implementing the practice.

Make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Management</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entitywide</ENAMEX> Priority
The quality and image of federal financial management has
suffered from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of neglect and an organizational culture that
has not fully recognized the value of good financial managementnot
even at its most basic levelas a means of ensuring accountability.
Making financial management a priority throughout the federal
government involves changing the organizational culture of federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Although the views about how an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> can change
its culture vary considerably, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied
identified leadership as the most important factor in successfully
making cultural changes. Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> must be totally committed
in both words and actions to changing the culture, and this
commitment must be sustained and demonstrated to staff.
The leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied made financial management
improvement an entitywide priority by building a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and accountability that supports external reporting and
performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, providing clear strong executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, and using training to change the organizational culture
and engage line management.

Build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation of Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Accountability That Supports</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">External Reporting and Performance Management</ENAMEX>
Key characteristics


•
The financial reporting and audit process is a basic
management and oversight tool.


•
Accountability is part of the organizational culture and
goes well beyond receiving an unqualified audit opinion.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> controls meet both external financial reporting
and performance management control objectives without significantly
impacting efficiency.


A solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of control and accountability requires a
system of checks and balances that provides reasonable assurance
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s transactions are appropriately recorded and
reported, its assets protected, its established policies followed,
and its resources used economically and efficiently for the
purposes intended. The private sector and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we
visited built and maintained this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> largely through the
discipline of preparing routine periodic financial statements and
annually subjecting them to an independent audit. However, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognize that the financial
information demanded by decisionmakers to measure and manage
performance requires greater precision and more timely access than
that required to receive an unqualified opinion on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
financial statements. To ensure that decisionmakers have useful,
relevant, timely, and reliable information, leading finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> establish accountability goals that extend well
beyond receiving an unqualified audit opinion. In addition, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> controls at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are designed to
efficiently meet the control objectives necessary for performance
measurement and management as well as external financial
reporting.
Similarly, according to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> survey of federal CFOs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX> federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> continue to expand their focus from audited
financial statements to include performance measurement and
strategic planning. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) are aggressively working on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
priority initiatives outlined in the1998 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Status Report</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">FiveYear Plan</ENAMEX>. Although one of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> priorities focused on obtaining an unqualified opinion on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> financial statements, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> priorities taken as a whole
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aim</ENAMEX> at improving the financial and performance information needed
to make and implement effective policy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, stewardship,
and program decisions.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Studies</ENAMEX>
Accountability goals and an effective control structure provide
the basis for a more resultsoriented government

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth of Virginia</ENAMEX>
To build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of control and accountability, senior
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth of Virginia</ENAMEX> had clear goals
and objectives that went beyond receiving an unqualified audit
opinion. With the passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Single Audit Act</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth of Virginia</ENAMEX> had to produce and have audited
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports</ENAMEX> (CAFR) for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time.
Although not required by the act, the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller</ENAMEX> had each
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> also produce audited financial statements, thereby
ensuring accountability at every level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> rather than
solely at those levels considered material to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAFR</ENAMEX>. The goal was to
ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> would have useful, relevant, and
timely information for assessing and managing program
performance.
Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> routinely receives an unqualified opinion on
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAFR</ENAMEX>, only those state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with a specific need (e.g.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX>, enterprise and internal service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funds</ENAMEX>)
are required to produce auditable financial statements. The
remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> now are required to certify the accuracy of
financial information that feeds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAFR</ENAMEX>. By subjecting all state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to the rigorous discipline of preparing financial reports
and having them audited, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller</ENAMEX> increased accountability
for data accuracy beyond that required to receive an unqualified
audit opinion. State <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> continue to raise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and seek
new ways to increase accountability and improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
performance. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Planning and Budget</ENAMEX>
currently performs trend analysis and prepares fiscal impact
statements for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>, using useful, relevant, and
timely financial information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s integrated budget and
accounting systems. Also, to ensure that performance data and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">longrange</ENAMEX> plans drive budget decisions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has set goals,
including implementing an activitybased accounting and budgeting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, for enhancing its performance budgeting process.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas</ENAMEX>
Similarly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> the performance management system is an
integral part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> and statewide planning structures,
evaluation and decisionmaking processes, and accountability
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Creating and maintaining a performance management system
required close, consistent, and coordinated attention above and
beyond that required for external financial reporting purposes. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, the ability to produce fairly stated external financial
reports was only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in building a more effective,
resultsoriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. An unqualified opinion on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAFR</ENAMEX> provided, assurance that financial information was accurate
and reliable for evaluating its overall financial position.
However, an unqualified audit opinion by itself does not ensure
that the information needed to measure and manage performance is
useful, relevant, timely, or reliable. The internal controls that
were considered adequate for external financial reporting were not
always sufficient for performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. For example, internal
controls over expenditure data met the control objectives for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregating</ENAMEX> and reporting this information on the financial
statements; however, they did not meet the objectives for
calculating perunitcost efficiency measures required for
performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.
Therefore, state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, with the help of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Auditor</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, reevaluated and redesigned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> internal controls to meet
both external financial reporting and performance management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> objectives. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> routinely receives an
unqualified opinion on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAFR</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Auditor's Office</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> no longer spend the bulk of their time on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> issues related to external financial reporting. Instead,
their focus is on improving the reliability of performance
management information.



Strategies to Consider
To build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of control and accountability, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> could:


•
Leverage audit resources and the financial statement
audit process to improve data reliability and increase
accountability.


•
Increase accountability by establishing goals for (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
producing financial and performance reports for major programs
and/or business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) moving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> toward
more frequent financial reporting (e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>).


•
As part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s GPRA performance planning
process, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) establish efficiency criteria that measure the cost
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with program outcomes and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) develop an approach for
assessing and improving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> internal controls over
financerelated efficiency measures.


•
Use accounting and operational performance data to
support budget formulation and strategic planning.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive</ENAMEX> recognizes the important role the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> can play in improving overall business
performance and involves key business/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line managers</ENAMEX> in financial
management improvement initiatives.


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the top management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX>.


•
Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' sustained commitment to improving
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is reinforced through both their words and
actions.


A powerful, visionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> can change the direction, culture,
and perceptions of the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The chief executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>) of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> understand the important
role the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX> and the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> play in improving the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s overall business performance. Consequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX> is a
central figure on the top management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and heavily involved in
strategic planning and decisionmaking. In addition, the senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> demonstrated their sustained
commitment to financerelated improvement initiatives by using key
business/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line managers</ENAMEX> to drive improvement efforts, attending key
meetings, ensuring that the necessary resources are made available,
and creating a system of rewards and incentives to recognize those
who support improvement initiatives. In fact, the committed support
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line management</ENAMEX> are critical to the success of
financerelated improvement initiatives.
In the same way, federal financial management reform has
recently gained momentum through the committed support of top
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> has made financial
management improvement a top priority and established a goal to
obtain an unqualified opinion on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s financial
statements. To achieve this goal, he directed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> without an unqualified audit opinion to submit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an initial plan for resolving financial reporting deficiencies
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> progress reports for achieving the goal. Further,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> is required to periodically report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> submissions and governmentwide progress. In addition, many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal CFOs</ENAMEX> have primary leadership responsibility for
implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Results Act</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> level. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX> has played a key leadership role in establishing
financial and performance improvement goals and priorities for
changing the way federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> plan, budget, manage, evaluate,
and account for federal programs.
To ensure that federal financial management improvement efforts
succeed and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX>'s priorities
are achieved, the support and involvement of key nonfinancial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> is critical. This commitment starts with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> establishing priorities and setting
expectations and continues with the active involvement of
program<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">/line managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in driving financial
improvement initiatives.



Strategies to Consider
To demonstrate and reinforce commitment to improving financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> could:


•
Form an executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management team</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of component
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and those reporting directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> head) to
establish a vision and fundamental goals and provide sponsorship
for each major financial management improvement project.


•
Involve key program /business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in driving
financial improvement initiatives.


•
Develop a plan to ensure that all key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>
visibly support financial management improvement
initiatives.


•
Actively market the program benefits of financial
management improvement efforts to secure the necessary resources
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional</ENAMEX> support.


•
Establish an expectation that top financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>,
as part of the top management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, provide forward looking
analysis that creates a link between accounting information and
budget formulation and contributes to strategic planning and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisionmaking</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engage Line Management</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">• Training</ENAMEX> and tools are provided to facilitate and accelerate
the pace of change initiatives.
Improving federal financial management hinges upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>'s
ability to manage change and create an organizational culture that
values good financial management. Legislation starting with the CFO
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1990</ENAMEX> has been directed at enhancing the finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s responsibilities in supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
federal activities. Although acceptance by the program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> has
sometimes been slow, according to a recent survey of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFOs</ENAMEX>,4
program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> are starting to look to the finance organization
for help. They attribute the change to a joint effort by program
and finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> to implement the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Results Act</ENAMEX> and develop
strategic plans. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX>'s numerous outreach
efforts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRArelated</ENAMEX> education events have helped to win the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> of program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>.
The key to successfully managing change and changing
organizational culture is gaining the support of line management.
To change the organizational culture and enlist the support of line
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> utilize training programs. Some are
generic in nature and are intended to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> anticipate and
cope with change and ensure that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the organization
understands the need for change. Others are specifically geared
towards providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line managers</ENAMEX> with a greater appreciation of the
financial implications of their business decisions. Through these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> gain a better understanding of
business problems and nonfinancial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> gain an appreciation of
the value of financial information. This not only produces better
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, it also helps break down functional barriers that can
affect productivity and impede improvement efforts.
In addition, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> provide tools to facilitate and
accelerate the pace of the change initiative. According to one
executive we met with, change initiatives that are implemented
slowly generally fail because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> have too much time to
contemplate the potential negative effects that change might bring
and rally opposition that ultimately undermines the effort.

Case Study
Training programs teach nonfinancial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> the value of
financial information and facilitate the pace of change

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Company</ENAMEX>
To ensure that nonfinancial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at all levels understand
the value of financial information, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has developed an
education program that teaches <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> basic business competence.
Using a threestep development planning process, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> assess
their current capabilities, determine their specific development
needs, and build and execute a development plan. (See appendix II.)
Depending on individual need, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> offers a variety of learning
experiences including selfpaced, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, classroom, case study, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulation</ENAMEX>. For example, through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s Creating Value learning
project, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> learn how to recognize the importance of cash
flow and its influence on business decisions, understand
shareholder expectations and the consequences of not meeting them,
and identify the relationship between individual decisions and
actions and shareholder value.
The information is presented in a "multiple media" format in
order to accommodate different learning styles and to allow
learning to occur in different environments and in periods best
suited to the learner. Other learning experiences include course
work, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elements</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Product Cost</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
analyze and use cost element information to support decisionmaking
related to improvement efforts, ensuring that resources are applied
to those activities that return the greatest benefits and provide
the highest value to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
learn to apply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost principles to the products they produce as
well as how process, activity, and individual cost elements, such
as labor, materials, and overhead, are accumulated to become unit
or product cost.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>) education and training programs have
played a crucial role in changing the organizational culture and
facilitating both financial and nonfinancial improvement
initiatives. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most successful programs is the Change
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Acceleration Process</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAP</ENAMEX>) workshop. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAP workshop</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> are given tools and taught
strategies for removing cultural barriers to change. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> has used these tools and strategies to facilitate
improvement initiatives, ranging from organizational restructuring
to changing the role of the internal audit function.
To be successful, the project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> spearheading these
initiatives had to achieve each of the following objectives: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
lead change, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) create a shared need,


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
shape a vision, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) mobilize commitment,


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
make change last, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) monitor progress, and


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>)
change systems and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. To ensure that each
objective would be accomplished, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> used a survey to profile
the change process and measures its progress. Staff and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
were surveyed periodically and asked to score each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
dimensions from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent to 0 percent</NUMEX> based on how well they
think each is being accomplished. For change to be successful, most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX> must be rated high.


The profile directed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s efforts so that they could
develop a strategy to address the areas that needed the most
attention. For example, mobilizing commitment, especially from
those outside the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, was often one of the more
difficult objectives to accomplish. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> used a
method, learned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAP workshop</ENAMEX>, for analyzing and increasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stakeholder</ENAMEX> commitment levels. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> listed the names of
those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> whose support was critical for the success of the
project. Then, they assessed each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholder</ENAMEX>'s level of commitment
based on their perceived level of agreementto what degree does the
individual agree that change is needed? If the team perceived a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> did not agree, it developed an individual plan to get this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s support. Plans were developed by addressing questions such
as: Why are they resisting this change? Do they have a vested
interest in the status quo? What new opportunities will they have
when the change is implemented? and Who influences this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and
what is their level of acceptance?



Strategies to Consider
To engage line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and create a culture that values good
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>
could:


•
Identify key financial and nonfinancial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and
staff whose support is critical to the success of financial
management improvement initiatives.



•
Develop curriculum and provide training that teaches key
nonfinancial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and staff



•
how to use financial information to improve operational
planning and decisionmaking and


•
how reform legislation (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFMIA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>)
will affect operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> roles, responsibilities, and processes
within the context of specific agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.




•
For all key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, develop curriculum and
provide training that provides a framework and tools that can be
used to facilitate and accelerate the pace of change
initiatives.

Redefine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Role of Finance To Better Support Mission</ENAMEX>
Objectives
In the private sector, the role of the finance organization
historically has centered on oversight and control, focusing on its
fiduciary responsibilities and external financial reporting
requirements. However, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> dramatic changes in the
business environment have forced finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to
reevaluate this role. The pressure to reduce administrative costs
resulting from competition in an emerging global market drove many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to find more efficient ways to deliver their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, becoming more efficient is not enough to
remain competitive. Today, leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are
focusing more on internal customer requirements by providing
products and services that directly support strategic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisionmaking</ENAMEX> and ultimately improve overall business
performance.
Similarly, competition has changed the environment in which
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> operate. Shrinking budgets have increased
competition for scarce resources, requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to make tough
resource allocation decisions that may affect program delivery.
Without the support of federal finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> may not be able to determine or defend the cost associated
with or benefits derived from government activities. We found the
leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we visited had redefined the role of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> to better support mission objectives by assessing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s current role in meeting mission objectives,
maximizing the efficiency of daytoday accounting activities, and
organizing finance to add value.

Key characteristics


•
The percentage of resources spent on strategic support
activities is used as an indicator of how well finance is
supporting mission objectives.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benchmarking</ENAMEX> and customer feedback is used to identify
performance gaps and best practices.


Many leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> assess their current role in
supporting mission objectives by comparing the percentage of staff
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> spent on strategic support activities, such as business
performance analysis or cost analysis, with the percentage of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> spent on transaction processing and other routine
accounting activities. According to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Executives</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Foundation</ENAMEX> report<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,5</NUMEX> transaction processing and other
routine accounting activities, such as accounts payable, payroll,
and external reporting, consume <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 69 percent</NUMEX> of costs within
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX>. Other studies indicate that these activities consume as
much <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 80 percent</NUMEX> of finance's resources. While transaction
processing will always exist, it does not have to drain the finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s resources. Therefore, many leading finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> have calculated and compared these percentages as a
general indication of how well they supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
business objectives. A goal for many leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> is to
reduce the time spent on transaction processing activities to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
percent.
To further assess the efficiency and effectiveness of specific
products and services, many of the leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we
studied relied on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">benchmarking6</TIMEX> and customer feedback. For example,
comparisons against worldclass benchmarks, such as closing the
books in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 4 days</TIMEX> or processing payroll at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.39</NUMEX> per
transaction, were used to identify activities or processes in need
of improvement. (See appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Worldclass Performance Metrics</ENAMEX>.)
In addition, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> used feedback from their internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to gather specific information related to quality and
customer expectations. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HewlettPackard</ENAMEX>'s finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> conducted a detailed survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200</NUMEX> internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> worldwide in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> were asked to rank certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>, or services, as either high or low in terms of both
importance and satisfaction. The survey results were then used to
guide improvement initiatives.

Case Study
Assessing and revising the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s charter, processes,
products, and services enables finance to better support business
objectives
The role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has changed
significantly over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>, from an organization
focused primarily on control and compliance, to one that is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">integral</ENAMEX> to making strategic business decisions. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About 6 years ago</TIMEX>,
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> embarked on a reengineering initiative to
transform its charter, processes, products, and services. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX>'s vision was to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX> " the preeminent corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in the industry." At the heart of this vision
was the concept that the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should actively
support the strategic imperatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer Inc.</ENAMEX>
Unlike many finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> going through this type of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s change effort was not in reaction to a
crisis. In fact, given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s long history of profitable
growth, there seemed to be little reason to change. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX>,
on the other hand, saw an opportunity to do things more effectively
and efficiently and thereby redeploy resources from transactional
activities (e.g., closing the books, preparing tax returns, paying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invoices</ENAMEX>) to value added activities (e.g., operations, treasury and
tax planning). The finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, for example, was producing
too much data and not enough information. To build a case for
change, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX> initiated a benchmarking survey to determine
exactly how his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> stacked up against the other leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. The results dramatized the magnitude of the
opportunity.
For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX> took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> to close its books versus the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 day</TIMEX> worldclass standard. Further, it cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX> twice as much
as the benchmark average to pay an invoice. This sobering news
served a vital purposeit created a sense of urgency surrounding the
need to change and helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX> rally the organizational support
needed to institute a comprehensive reengineering initiative
To facilitate change within the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, several
crossfunctional process improvement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were established. Through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> revisions to its charter, processes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX> has reduced the cost associated with transaction
processing activities by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 50 percent</NUMEX> in certain functions and
shifted its focus to activities that directly support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s
business objectives.
The shift in focus and resources has allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX>'s finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> to become a " growth enabler" on behalf of the company
by:


•
supplying the necessary resources (from information to
capital);



•
providing increased opportunities to invest (redeploy
financial gains or savings on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>);

• offering business solutions (" how," not " why not");
and


•
assisting in making the right business
decisions.




Strategies to Consider
To assess the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s current role in meeting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFOs</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">finance executives</ENAMEX>
could:


•
Identify all major functions performed by the finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> (e.g., accounts payable, payroll, performance
reporting, performance analysis) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> each function into
meaningful categories (e.g., transaction processing, control and
compliance, mission support).


•
Establish and monitor agency specific performance goals
and measures that reflect the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s role in
meeting mission objectives (i.e., the percentage of time or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> devoted to mission support vs. transaction processing or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and compliance activities).


•
Benchmark financial management practices and processes
with recognized industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> (e.g. the cost of finance as a
percentage of total outlays, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cost per accounting transaction)
in order to measure performance and identify best
practices.


•
To the extent that operating in a federal environment
affects specific benchmarks, compare financial management practices
and processes with other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to provide a context with
which to interpret benchmarking results.


•
Periodically survey internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> to obtain
information related to the quality and value of the products and
services they receive and use this information to guide improvement
initiatives.

Maximize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Efficiency of Daytoday Accounting Activities</ENAMEX>
Key characteristics


•
Inefficient processes are eliminated or
streamlined.


•
Transaction processing activities are consolidated,
standardized, and reengineered at shared service
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>.


•
The cost and benefits of outsourcing routine accounting
activities are considered.


As part of an overall strategy to reduce the cost of finance and
better support business objectives, many leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have
reduced the number of staff required to perform routine transaction
processing activities by eliminating or streamlining inefficient
processes and/or consolidating these activities at shared services
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>. Similarly, some federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are aggressively
expanding their use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Funds</ENAMEX> Transfer to include
contract payments and travel payments as a means of increasing the
efficiency of their routine accounting activities.
Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> private sector finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we visited
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consolidated</ENAMEX>, standardized, and reengineered routine processes,
such as accounts payable, fixed asset accounting, and payroll at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. The primary objective for moving to shared
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> is to reduce operating costs. However, other benefits
included better control and standardization of processes, more
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costeffective</ENAMEX> technology deployment, and an enhanced position for
continual improvement and customer service.
Although their approach varied depending on the size, culture,
and industry, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have realized the benefits of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> services by completing each of the following stages. The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> stage is consolidation and includes changing the
organizational structure and gaining control over processes. The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> stage is standardization and entails changing processes,
adopting a common technology platform, and continuous improvement.
The final stage is reengineering and involves changing workflow and
leveraging technology through the use of electronic commerce, data
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warehousing</ENAMEX>, and document imaging.
Similar to the findings in our previous report on outsourcing
the finance function<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,7</NUMEX> we found that although outsourcing is
considered an option for reducing costs and improving efficiency,
none of the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we visited were currently
outsourcing any significant aspect of their finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
The primary reason for not outsourcing is due to the limited
capacity of outsourcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> to perform larger, more complex
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> and accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. However, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
indicated that they are continually evaluating opportunities to
reduce costs and improve quality; therefore, as the outsourcing
market evolves and the capacity and quality of outsourcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>
improves, outsourcing may become a more attractive alternative.

Case Study
Effectively implementing shared service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> can result in
reduced operating costs and better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> support
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, hightech <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have seen their gross
margins shrink smaller and smaller as a result of increased
competition and the steady introduction of newer, faster, and more
advanced technology. To remain competitive and ensure continued
growth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> formed a task force to find ways to reduce
the cost of the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. At the time, the cost of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> was
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 percent</NUMEX> of company revenues and accounting transaction costs
were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two to three</NUMEX> times that of comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. The
task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> recommended that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> consolidate its
transaction processing activities such as accounts payable,
accounts receivable, payroll, and fixed assets accounting from over
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> decentralized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Service Centers</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>. As a result, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> needed to process
accounting transactions was reduced by more than halffrom about
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1,200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> worldwide.
By implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Service Centers, Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX>
reduced the costs of its finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.8 percent</NUMEX> of
revenues in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> and to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1.0</NUMEX>
percent by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s finance costs are now in the top
quartile of comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
However, creating a shared service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> was much more than
simply centralizing activities and cashing in on economies of
scale. To achieve these cost savings and provide innovative,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costeffective</ENAMEX> shared business services, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> not only
had to consolidate its activities, but it also had to reengineer
its processes and change its organizational structure.
At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Service Center</ENAMEX>, processreengineering
initiatives alone have resulted in cost savings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$36 million</NUMEX>
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. Through the use of electronic data interchange,
document imaging, and common software <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> has
maximized its use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human resources</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each month</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX>'s 295
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> process <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">165,000</NUMEX> invoices, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> travel expense reports,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,000</NUMEX> checks, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77,000</NUMEX> payments, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122,000</NUMEX> electronic
transactions, reimbursements, and deposits. In addition, the center
performs general ledger and fixed asset accounting and responds to
customer inquiries. As part of its overall effort to reduce
infrastructure costs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> also redesigned its organizational
structure using a selfdirected, teambased approach. Each of the
fourto eightperson <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> is responsible for a number of tasks, such
as timecards, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overtime</TIMEX>, and discretionary budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. The
benefits of a team concept include ownership of customer problems,
higher morale, and increased creativity/problem solving.

Strategies to Consider
To maximize the efficiency of daytoday accounting activities,
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> could:
Identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">highvolume</ENAMEX> processes or transactions that do not
directly support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s mission (lowvalue, lowrisk) and
evaluate opportunities for

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> service center, initially by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and then across
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX>;

• The organizational structure and human capital strategies
support strategic business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> needs as well as traditional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controllership</ENAMEX> and transaction processing needs.
According to a recent survey of federal CFOs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,8</NUMEX> the federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the future will have fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, with a
greater percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX>. Currently, however,
most functions within finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are focused primarily
on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) establishing and administering policy,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) tracking, monitoring, and reconciling account balances, or
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. While they
recognize the need for change, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFOs</ENAMEX> surveyed, many
questions remain unanswered regarding how best to scope, define,
and organize finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> responsibilities.
When it comes to organizational design, we found that leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> often had the same or similar core functions
(i.e., budgeting, treasury <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, general accounting,
payroll). However, the way these functions were organized varied
depending on individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> needs. In practice <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of this guide,
we discussed how leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> reduced the number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> required to perform financial management activities by
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) consolidating activities at a shared service center and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
eliminating or streamlining duplicative or inefficient processes.
Their goal was not only to reduce the cost of finance but also to
organize finance to add value by reallocating finance resources to
more productive strategic support activities.
To accomplish this, leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have realigned
their mission and organizational structure to better support the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s business objectives. Specifically, many leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> have (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) organized around core business processes to
simplify work and flatten hierarchies,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) consolidated certain transaction processing activities to

accounting and financial analysis, to the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to support
business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>' strategic planning and decisionmaking needs. In

•
Develop an explicit workforce planning strategy that is

ensure that financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with skills for analyzing

Provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meaningful Information</ENAMEX> to Decisionmakers
Financial information is meaningful when it is useful, relevant,
timely, and reliable. However, many federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> lack the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and processes required to produce meaningful financial
information needed for management decisionmaking. For example, many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> financial and management information systems do not
routinely provide adequate, timely cost or performance information
needed to manage cost, measure performance, make program funding
decisions, and analyze outsourcing or privatization options.
Similarly, many private sector and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have
struggled to overcome some of the same management information
issues that now face federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, global competition and advances in
information technology have changed information requirements and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' expectations regarding the availability and usefulness of
financial information. Financial information that, in the past, was
considered adequate for decisionmaking is now considered
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overaggregated</ENAMEX> and too late to be useful. The leading finance
organizations we visited enhanced their capabilities for providing
meaningful information to decisionmakers by developing management
information systems that support the partnership between finance
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, reengineering processes in conjunction with
implementing new technology, and translating financial data into
meaningful information.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Practice 7</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Develop Systems</ENAMEX> That Support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partnership Between Finance</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX>
Key characteristics


•
The general ledger system is integrated into business
processes and is adequate for financial reporting and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>.


•
Automated system(s) are designed and deployed that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
accurately measure the costs of activities, processes, products,
and services and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) provide line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> with timely, accurate
financial and nonfinancial information on the quality and
efficiency of business processes and performance


•
An enterprisewide system integrates operating, financial,
and management information and allows decisionmakers to access
relevant information easily and perform adhoc data
analysis.


As federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> develop plans for acquiring and installing
financial systems, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ClingerCohen Act of 1996</ENAMEX> and related
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> guidance will provide a framework for designing
and deploying information technology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ClingerCohen Act</ENAMEX> requires
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to better link their information technology planning and
investment decisions to program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and goals. If implemented
effectively, this legislation will provide a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> that will
help federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> improve the interoperability of financial,
operating, and management systems.
The leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we visited have long had
general ledger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> capable of generating auditable financial
statements efficiently and routinely, thereby providing information
on stewardship and accountability at a high level. Further, they
historically have had adequate systems for measuring and managing
cost and performance. However, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> new technology
has made it possible for these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to integrate these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and provide more relevant, accessible information that
meets the changing needs of decisionmakers. Many leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> have already implemented, or are in the process of
implementing an enterprisewide system to integrate financial and
operating data to support both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> decisionmaking and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">external</ENAMEX> reporting requirements. Some abandoned their legacy
systems all together and turned to stateoftheart integrated
architectures, while others used wellfunctioning legacy systems and
tied them together with a data warehouse. Regardless of the
approach, these systems provided financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX>,
and business unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> access to the same cost, performance,
and profitability information.
Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFMIP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, and individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are working to improve the integration of budget,
accounting, and program information and systems. To support this
process, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Program Management Office</ENAMEX> was recently established to
develop financial systems requirements, address system integration
issues, and generally facilitate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> selection and
procurement process. This and other measures are important to
ensure that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> provide meaningful information for
managing and measuring cost and performance as well as preparing
external financial reports.
30



Strategies to Consider
To develop systems that support the partnership between finance
and operations senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> could:


•
Acquire and install a general ledger system adequate for
external financial reporting purposes.


•
Develop managerially relevant cost information systems
and strategic performance management systems that access data from
financial transaction systems and relevant operating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.


•
Integrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s financial (including budgetary),
operating, and management systems and equip decisionmakers with the
tools to easily access relevant information and perform adhoc
analyses.



•
Ensure that financial systems comply with federal
financial management systems requirements, federal accounting
standards, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Government Standard General Ledger</ENAMEX>
by



•
establishing the goal of using a single general ledger
chart of accounts (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Government Standard General Ledger</ENAMEX>)
and


•
developing an interim approach to convert general ledger
accounts not consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Government Standard General</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ledger</ENAMEX>. This approach should use automated crosswalks performed by
those business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> responsible for the data.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reengineer Processes in Conjunction With Implementing New</ENAMEX>
Technology
Key characteristics


•
Commercial offtheshelf software packages implemented with
limited modification.


•
Processes and controls adapted to fit commercial
offtheshelf software.


•
Processes are reengineered across functional
lines.


At many of the leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we visited, the
vast majority of financial applications were commercial offtheshelf
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COTS</ENAMEX>) packages that were implemented with limited modification to
the basic application package itself. The advantages of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COTS</ENAMEX>
software include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) COTS software is less costly than developing
inhouse applications, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) software upgrades are affordable and are
regularly available, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) COTS software is designed to include
best practices.
The key to successfully implementing COTS systems and best
practice processes, according to leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, is
reengineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes to fit the new software
applications. In fact, productivity gains typically result from
more efficient processes, not from simply automating old ones.
Effectively reengineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes, however, requires
moving from a functionalbased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to a processbased
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. For example, the procurement process in a
processbased federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> would start when a solicitation
is issued, continue through contract award and signature, as well
as the issuance of purchase/work orders and receipt of goods, and
end when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> properly received payment. The business
processes would be designed to maximize the efficiency and accuracy
of the entire process.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ClingerCohen Act</ENAMEX> contains provisions requiring federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to modernize inefficient administrative and missionrelated
work processes before making significant technology investments to
support them. As a result, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are beginning to
consider the merits of information technology approaches that
involve reengineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes in conjunction with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">implementing COTS</ENAMEX> software without significant modification.
According to a report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Systems Committee</ENAMEX> of the CFO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> favor an approach that uses COTS software
for core financial systems and other financial management
applications. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> efforts to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COTS products</ENAMEX> have
been hampered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s failure to communicate
requirements and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">functionality</ENAMEX> effectively to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and a
proclivity on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to modify software to meet
existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes and to replicate previous system
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functionality</ENAMEX>. To encourage the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COTS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFMIP</ENAMEX> are
working to improve (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the testing and certification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COTS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) existing procurement schedules, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) processes to
obtain COTS systems.


Case Study
Reengineering core business processes across functional lines is
the key to successful COTS implementation
When implementing its new financial management system rather
than fitting new technology to outofdate processes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens Corning</ENAMEX>
redesigned its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes to fit the new technology. The
objective was to improve customer service and, at the same time,
cut logistical costs related to various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes. To
achieve these objectives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens Corning</ENAMEX> formed crossfunctional
process improvement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> for each major business process to
improve or replace longstanding and often ineffective business
processes.
During this effort, the improvement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> used many common
reengineering tools, such as process mapping and process modeling.
However, successfully reengineering its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes had more
to do with the parameters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens Corning</ENAMEX> placed on its process
improvement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were given compressed
schedules for completing " as is" modeling to prevent overanalysis
and to force decisions. Documenting current processes should be
accomplished in a matter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week or two</TIMEX>. The bulk of time should
be spent on defining user requirements and designing new processes.
Another important aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens Corning</ENAMEX> process improvement
effort was its use of a process reengineering management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> was made up of key process and business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> executives
that acted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arbitrators</ENAMEX> when conflicts developed.
By reengineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes in conjunction with
implementing new technology, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens Corning</ENAMEX> increased its ability to
meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> needs. In the past, for example, many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s computers were not linked, making it impossible for sales
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to check on the availability of products or address problems
on a customer invoice. Now, all activities that occur from the time
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> places an order to the time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens Corning</ENAMEX> receives
payment are part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Customer Fulfillment Process</ENAMEX>. In addition,
new technology has integrated functions related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Customer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fulfillment Process</ENAMEX>, such as sales, ordering, production, shipping,
billing, and accounts receivable, providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> with greater
access to data. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens Corning</ENAMEX>'s salesforce not only
has access to uptodate information, but more efficient processes
allow sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to respond immediately to customer inquiries,
instead of handing the problem off to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>.
Other outcomes related to process improvement included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
reducing the time it takes to close the books from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 days</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
dayswith a target of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 day</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) reducing the chart of accounts from
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,400 to 900</NUMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) standardizing reporting, which allows
comparisons to be made between operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>.

Strategies to Consider
To reengineer processes that support new technology, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> could:


•
Form crossfunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) examine existing core
business processes and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) define user requirements.


•
Compare <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">COTS products</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s requirements
and identify the COTS packages that most closely match the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
needs.


•
Reevaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> requirements not supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COTS</ENAMEX>
software and determine, before customizing software, whether each
requirement is still valid or whether alternatives exist that may
be more costeffective.


•
Where software modifications are required, implement an
effective configuration management system that includes (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) clearly
defining and assessing the effects of modifications on future
product upgrades before the modification is approved, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) clearly
documenting software products that are placed under configuration
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) maintaining the integrity and traceability of
the configuration throughout the system life cycle.


•
Implement a quality assurance process that ensures that
project activities and software products adhere to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s
established plans, standards, and procedures. This includes
ensuring that the configuration management process is effectively
implemented and that product changes are clearly documented and
tested before being placed into production.


•
Implement an effective risk management strategy to ensure
that project risks, such as customization and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>'s ability to
deliver a given system, are adequately identified and effective
mitigation strategies are implemented.



Key characteristics
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Translate Financial Data • Reports</ENAMEX> are designed around key
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Meaningful Information</ENAMEX> such as markets, products, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">• Relevant</ENAMEX> financial information is presented in an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">understandable</ENAMEX>, simple format with suitable amounts of detail and
explanation.
While new technology has made financial data more available,
without the ability to translate that data into relevant,
understandable information, decisionmakers are left powerless.
Traditionally, finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have used voluminous paper
reports, based primarily on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior month</TIMEX>'s activity, to
communicate financial information. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> reports were
often designed around current organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
Consequently, as organizational structures changed over time, many
management reports became irrelevant.
Today, leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have eliminated, reduced,
and/or redesigned much of their old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> reporting formats to
better meet the needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have
designed new reporting formats around key business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> rather
than organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
with relevant, forwardlooking information on business unit
performance. During this process, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> we visited actually
stopped distributing selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> reports to determine
whether anyone would miss them. They used the subsequent lack of
reaction as an indicator that the information in the report was no
longer relevant.
Further, standardized reports are designed to present
information that is analyzed to bring out pertinent and fundamental
points with suitable amounts of detail and explanation. For
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens Corning</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> access a
standardized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> financial report via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s internal
area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. The report's executive summary is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pages long and
contains executivelevel reporting, forecasting, and budgeting
information. However, multiple levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX> are available, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisionmakers</ENAMEX> can drill down to the desired level of detail.
Similarly, efforts are currently underway across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to
develop a meaningful, userfriendly accountability report on
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. These reports consolidate and
integrate audited financial statements and reporting under the
Results Act and other related laws to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) show the degree to which
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> met its goals and at what cost and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) aid the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> in
determining whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> was well run.

Strategies to Consider
To improve management reporting of financial information, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, as part of the top management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, could:


•
Meet with key policymakers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> on an ongoing

basis to define key business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> and determine what key
business information is needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and oversight of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency's</ENAMEX> mission and objectives.


•
Determine what information is needed by program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to meet and support key business
information requirements.


•
Present various reporting format and content options to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Committees</ENAMEX>.

Build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Team</ENAMEX> That Delivers Results
As the finance function has evolved over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, from a
paperdriven, labor intensive, clerical role to a more consultative
role as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>, and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, many leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have seen a corresponding shift in the mix of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and competencies required to perform this new role. To
respond to these changing business needs, the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
we visited developed finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> with the right mix of skills and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">competencies</ENAMEX> and built finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that attract and
retain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> as part of an overall strategic approach to human
capital planning.
Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMRA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> have placed new demands
on federal finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
need to reassess their human capital practices to ensure that
federal financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> are equipped to meet these new
challenges and support their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' mission and goals. This

Key characteristics


•
A defined set of technical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and leadership
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and competencies is developed as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s

•
Training and career development programs use both
classroom instruction and rotational assignments.


•
Opportunities to "learn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>" are
provided.


At leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, developing a finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> with
the right mix of skills and competencies starts by defining a set
of skills and competencies that will enable the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to
meet the current and future technical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and leadership
needs of the business. The resulting competency profile is used to
assess gaps in individual or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> competency levels and develop
human capital strategies to address current or expected future
deficiencies. In this practice we discuss the training, career
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, and successionplanning strategies leading finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> use to develop a team with the right mix of skills
and competencies.
The training and career development programs of the leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we visited provided intensive 2to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3year</NUMEX> entry
level programs as well as midcareer and executivelevel programs
that used both classroom instruction and rotational assignments to
develop technical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and leadership skills and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">competencies</ENAMEX>. The programs' course work focuses initially on the
tools and techniques of advanced accounting and finance as well as
general business skills. Then, the focus shifts to the strategic
application of these tools within businessspecific environments.
However, the key to implementing a successful career development
program is to complement course work with reallife business
experience through the use of planned rotational assignments. The
leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we visited provided opportunities for
staff to rotate through various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> throughout the finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> as well as the operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>. Such opportunities
are critical not only in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> that understand the
whole business and, in turn, provide greater value to their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> in the operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> but also as a way of ensuring
that an adequate supply of wellprepared financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> is
available to fill key positions.
Similarly, federal finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are recognizing the
need to provide a broad range of experience to its financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. For example, as a way to develop a cadre of
experienced and diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council Fellows Program</ENAMEX>
was initiated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April of 1998</TIMEX> with the selection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX>
to serve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1year</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointments</ENAMEX> at host <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.

Strategies to Consider
To develop a team with the right mix of skills and competencies,
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> could:



•
As a part of an agencywide strategic approach to human
capital planning



(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
determine the leadership, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and
functional/technical competencies required for the finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> to support agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX>, goals, and objectives, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
evaluate the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s current and future human
capital capabilities, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) identify skill gaps, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) develop human
capital policies and practices that will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to fill the
identified skill gaps, and


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
evaluate these efforts and use performance data to
continually update human capital strategies.


• As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, assess the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s human
capital policies, programs and practices to determine whether they
support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s mission and vision for the future. (See
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s human capital selfassessment checklist<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>)



•
Using both classroom training, planned staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rotations</ENAMEX>,
and interagency assignments, design a career development program
geared toward



•
improving leadership, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and traditional
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> competencies, including the analytical skills
needed to support program decisionmaking;


•
understanding how reform legislation (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMRA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFMIA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>) will affect the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s roles,
responsibilities, and processes within the context of specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency operations</ENAMEX>; and


•
understanding overall agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, including
program implications of financial decisions.




•
Establish continuing professional education requirements
for financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> similar to those required for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>.

Build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Organization</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attracts and Retains</ENAMEX>
Talent
Key characteristics


•
Top financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> participates in the recruitment
of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX>.


•
A variety of clear career path opportunities are offered
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> development programs are used as a means of exposing
staff to different career opportunities.


•
Competitive compensation and benefits packages are
available.


As discussed in practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, sound training and career
development strategies are needed for the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to
meet the current and future human capital needs of the business.
Equally important, however, are recruitment, retention, and reward
strategies that enable the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to attract and
retain talented financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> at all levels. Although
their styles and strategies varied, the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we
visited agreed that several key factors were important in
attracting and retaining talent.
First, recruiting a talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> requires the commitment
of top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFOs</ENAMEX> at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are often
heavily involved talent assessment and senior executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> are
actively involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oncampus</ENAMEX> recruiting. This sends a powerful
message to potential new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> that the position is important
enough to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that it warrants senior executive
attention.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, attracting and ultimately keeping a highly qualified and
motivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> involves providing meaningful career
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opportunities</ENAMEX>, such as the opportunity to
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) participate in exciting groundbreaking projects, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) build a
portfolio of new skills, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) choose a variety of career paths.
These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> often used their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> development programs to
provide these opportunities. For example, as discussed in practice
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, career development programs often include rotational
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assignments</ENAMEX> and not only provide excellent growth opportunities but
also expose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to a variety of career path opportunities.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, compensation is a key factor in any career decision.
While, according to employee compensation surveys, compensation is
fairly comparable between the private and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> for entry
level and middle management positions, executive compensation in
the private sector far exceeds that of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, thereby
limiting federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' ability to attract and retain federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>. (See appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> for compensation survey results.)
However, other factors such as the desire to effect change and make
a difference may attract senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to public service. In
addition, opportunities may exist that will enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>'
ability to attract and retain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> at all levels. For example,
the revolutionary changes that are taking place as a result of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX> and Results Acts provide an ideal occasion to revamp the
opportunities available to federal financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and to
market the possibilities offered by a career in federal financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.



Strategies to Consider
To build an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that attracts and retains talent, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> could:


•
Actively work with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
market the opportunities available for financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) include a federal accounting and financial management
curriculum that will not only prepare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> for careers in
federal accounting but will also help promote federal career
possibilities.


•
Continue to work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Personnel Management</ENAMEX>
to provide more flexible career paths that provide opportunities
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> throughout the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> program
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utilize</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> development programs and planned staff
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rotations</ENAMEX> to expose financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to a variety of
career paths.

identify the factors that are essential for finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
to improve their financial management and move towards worldclass
standards, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) provide case studies which illustrate the
efforts of leading finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> from private sector
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to improve their financial
management and the overall performance of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
We formed an advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to assist with job design, our
overall scope and methodology, and case study selection as well as
to critique our research findings and comment on our draft report.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> consisted of private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, state and local
comptrollers, academicians, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>
outside the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Key</ENAMEX> contacts and project advisors
are listed in appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">VII</ENAMEX>.) We also consulted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>.
To meet our research objectives, we performed an extensive
literature search on the subject of financial management best
practices using commercial best practice databases, the Internet,
prior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reports, trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, federal
guidelines, private sector studies, and other resources. We
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesized</ENAMEX> and analyzed the numerous documents acquired from our
literature search and case study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to determine the
objectives essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to improve their financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Based on consultations with our advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and our
case study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, we consolidated and refined the factors to
those presented in this guide.
We selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to serve as our case studies. We selected the private
sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> based on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) recognition for outstanding financial
management practices and/or successful financial reengineering
efforts, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) size and complexity comparable to federal government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of our advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
We selected the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> based on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1995</TIMEX> "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>" report issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial World</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of our advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO Council</ENAMEX>.
We interviewed various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, including chief financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief information officers</ENAMEX>, business unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>,
state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> and legislative branch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">controllers</ENAMEX>, internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>, and human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>. We also reviewed various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> documents,
including vision statements, strategic plans, core competencies for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, training and development guides, key financial
reports, performance metrics, and other documents related to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reengineering</ENAMEX> efforts of the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
We asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at the private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> profiled in the case studies to verify the accuracy of
the information presented on their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and
incorporated their comments as appropriate; however, we did not
independently verify the accuracy of that information. In addition,
we provided a draft of this entire guide to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the CFO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>, and our advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for their review and comment.
