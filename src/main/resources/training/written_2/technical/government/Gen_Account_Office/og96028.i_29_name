schedule in order to meet the increased revenue requirements.
In addition to adjusting the fee schedule to ensure collection
of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$126,400,000</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> and Order also adjusts the fee
schedule and associated payment procedures for certain fees
mandated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, makes changes to the estimated number of
units subject to a fee, and incorporates certain public interest
considerations. See <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 159</NUMEX>(b).

the number of regulatees subject to a fee, to simplify the
schedule, and to clarify and revise certain payment procedures as
provided for in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 9</ENAMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Communications Act of 1934</ENAMEX>,
