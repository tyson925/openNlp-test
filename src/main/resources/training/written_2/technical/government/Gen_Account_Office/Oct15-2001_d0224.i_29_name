Economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee Congress</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>:
This report responds to your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX> request that we study the
practices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that successfully share sensitive or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>-critical information. Information sharing and coordination are
key elements in developing comprehensive and practical approaches
to defending against computer-based, or cyber, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attacks</ENAMEX>, which could
threaten the national welfare. Such attacks could severely disrupt
computer-supported operations, compromise the confidentiality of
sensitive information, and diminish the integrity of critical data.
Computer-based incidents, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ILOVEYOU</ENAMEX> virus in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2000</TIMEX>
and the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Code Red, SirCam</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Nimda attacks</ENAMEX>, have caused
significant disruptions and damage.1 In addition, the terrorist
attacks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> illustrate the importance of having timely
information from others on threats and possible precursors to an
attack.
The importance of sharing information and coordinating the
response to cyber threats among various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> has increased
as our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> have become ever more reliant on
interconnected computer systems to support critical operations and
infrastructures, such as telecommunications, power distribution,
financial services, national defense, and critical government
operations. Information on threats and incidents experienced by
others can help stakeholders identify trends, better understand the
risks they face, and determine what preventative measures should be
implemented. Accordingly, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s strategy for
protecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s critical computer-dependent infrastructure
sectors includes efforts to establish information sharing and
analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> (ISACs) within both the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and
individual industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX>. Such analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> can use
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, timely information on incidents to determine the
nature of an attack, provide warnings, and advise on how to
mitigate an imminent attack.

To identify practices that could be adopted by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
and others to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) promote successful sharing of information on
computer-based vulnerabilities and incidents and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) overcome
related challenges, we studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> experienced in
developing pertinent informationsharing relationships and
procedures. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix I</ENAMEX> contains a description of our objectives,
the scope of our study, and the methodology we used. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> II
describes each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> covered by our review.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> identified a number of
factors that they deemed critical



Results in Brief
to their success in building successful information-sharing
relationships with and among their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. All of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> as the essential underlying element
to successful relationships and said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> could be built only
over time and, primarily, through personal relationships. Other
critical success factors identified included



(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
establishing effective and appropriately secure
communication mechanisms, such as regular meetings and secure Web
sites, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) obtaining the support of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at member
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> regarding the sharing of potentially sensitive member
information and the commitment of resources, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) ensuring
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> continuity. In addition, to be successful,
information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> provided identifiable membership
benefits, such as current information about threats,
vulnerabilities, and incidents; information on lessons learned; and
free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> advice. Without such benefits, according to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> we met with, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> would not continue
participating.

Among the challenges identified, one of the most difficult was
overcoming new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' initial reluctance to share information.
Other challenges included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) developing agreements on the use and
protection of shared information, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) obtaining adequate funding to
cover the cost of items such as Web sites and meetings while
avoiding seeking contributions intended primarily to promote the
interests of an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>,


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
maintaining a focus on emerging issues of interest to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
maintaining professional and administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with
appropriate skills.


The critical success factors and challenges described by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> provide useful insights for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that are
developing informationsharing relationships to assist in critical
infrastructure protection. In addition, as it did regarding the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year 2000</TIMEX> computing challenge, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can play a key role by
actively monitoring progress in meeting critical infrastructure
protection goals, including improved information sharing, and by
assisting in clarifying the way federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> may use sensitive
information provided for critical infrastructure protection
purposes. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed legislation intended to address
concerns from private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> about exposure to legal
liability and antitrust law violations that might arise due to
sharing information on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year 2000</TIMEX> readiness. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is
currently considering measures intended to address several of the
practices and challenges we identified pertaining to critical
infrastructure protection.
In commenting on a draft of this report, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> of our
study agreed with the critical success factors and challenges that
we identified. Several provided additional supporting points and
examples, which we have included in the report as appropriate.
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and
our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> have become


Background
increasingly reliant on computer systems to support critical
operations and infrastructures, such as telecommunications, power
distribution, financial services, emergency services, national
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX>, and critical government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. Over the same period,
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interconnectivity</ENAMEX> experienced an unprecedented growth,
most notably in the use of the Internet, that has revolutionized
the way our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, and much of the world
communicate and conduct business. The benefits have been enormous
in terms of facilitating communications, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes, and
access to information. However, without proper safeguards, this
widespread interconnectivity poses enormous risks to our computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and, more importantly, to the critical operations and
infrastructures they support.
Attacks could severely disrupt computer-supported operations,
compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information, and
diminish the integrity of critical data. A significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> or hostile foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> could severely damage or
disrupt critical operations, resulting in harm to the public
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">welfare</ENAMEX>. Threats are increasing, in part, because the number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with computer skills is increasing and because
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intrusion</ENAMEX>, or "hacking," techniques have become readily accessible
through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>, computer bulletin boards, and Internet Web
sites. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of and motives behind cyber attacks
often cannot be readily determined. This is because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> can attack remotely from anywhere in the world, over
the Internet, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, or dial-up lines, and they can
disguise their identity, location, and intent by launching attacks
across a span of communications systems and computers. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
provides an overview of the various types of risks to
computer-based operations.

The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has recognized that mitigating risks to
our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s critical computer-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">infrastructures</ENAMEX>, many of
which are privately owned, is a serious challenge requiring
coordination and cooperation among federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and
private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the National
Research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> studied the issue and reported that "as computer
systems become more prevalent, sophisticated, embedded in physical
processes, and interconnected, society becomes more vulnerable to
poor system design, accidents that disable systems, and attacks on
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>."<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Commission on</ENAMEX>
Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infrastructure Protection</ENAMEX> was established to investigate
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s vulnerability to both cyber and physical threats. The
commission's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1997</TIMEX> report, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Critical Foundations</ENAMEX>: Protecting
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infrastructures</ENAMEX>, described the potentially devastating
implications of poor information security from a national
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1998</TIMEX>, in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> report, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> issued <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Presidential Decision Directive</ENAMEX> (PDD) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>, which
outlined a strategy for combating the threat of cyber attacks by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terrorists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>, or others. The directive
tasked federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with developing critical infrastructure
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX> plans.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDD</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> recognized the importance of establishing
mechanisms for sharing information on system vulnerabilities,
threats, intrusions, and anomalies so that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and
industry could better prepare to warn and defend against
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">computer-based attacks</ENAMEX>. Specifically, it designated "lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>"
within the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to work with private-sector and
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> in each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> infrastructure sectors and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> special function areas. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> infrastructures identified
were (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) information and communications; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) banking and finance;
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) water supply; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) aviation, highway, mass transit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pipelines</ENAMEX>,
rail, and waterborne commerce; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) emergency law enforcement; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>)
emergency fire services and continuity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) electric
power and oil and gas production and storage; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>) public health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> special function areas were (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) law enforcement
and internal security, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) intelligence, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) foreign affairs, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> defense, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) research and development. The directive
also encouraged the creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISACs</ENAMEX> that could serve as
mechanisms for gathering, analyzing, appropriately sanitizing, and
disseminating information to and from infrastructure

sectors and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Further, it recognized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Infrastructure Protection Center</ENAMEX>
as a national threat assessment, warning, vulnerability, and law
enforcement investigation and response <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
Information sharing and coordination among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are
central to producing comprehensive and practical approaches and
solutions to combating computer-based threats. Having information
on threats and on actual incidents experienced by others can help
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> identify trends, better understand the risks it
faces, and determine what preventative measures should be
implemented. In addition, comprehensive, timely information on
incidents can help federal and nonfederal analysis centers
determine the nature of an attack, provide warnings, and advise on
how to mitigate an imminent attack.
However, we previously reported that progress in implementing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDD</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX>, including the establishment of information-sharing
relationships, has been slow. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISACs</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> industry
sectors had been established as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> had been in
existence only since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> 2000.3 Further, as we reported in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Infrastructure Protection Center</ENAMEX> had mixed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> in establishing information-sharing relationships with
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government entities</ENAMEX> and private industry.4
Despite this limited progress, a number of government and
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have gained experience in establishing
information-sharing relationships. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> range from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that disseminate information on immediate threats and
vulnerabilities, to those that seek to facilitate information
sharing between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> on industry-specific
threats, to those that promote coordination across infrastructure
sectors and on an international scale. However, developing the
information-sharing and coordination capabilities that could assist
in effectively addressing computer-based threats and actual
incidents has proven to be challenging as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> grapple
with ways to ensure that useful and complete data are collected;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appropriately</ENAMEX> analyzed; protected from inappropriate disclosure;
and efficiently and effectively disseminated, often in the form of
warnings.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Factors Critical</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Successful Information</ENAMEX>
Sharing
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> identified several critical success factors
that they viewed as essential to establishing, developing, and
maintaining effective information-sharing relationships, which
could benefit critical infrastructure protection efforts. These
factors included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) fostering trust and respect; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) establishing
effective, timely, and appropriately secure communication; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
obtaining top management support; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) ensuring organization
leadership continuity; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) generating clearly identifiable
membership benefits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster Trust</ENAMEX> and Respect An underlying
element to the success of information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> was
developing trusted relationships among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX>. Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had
professional and administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> that provided analytical
capabilities and facilitated their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' participation in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s activities. Others were less formally structured
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> that relied primarily on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> for such support.
Trust was critical to overcome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' reluctance to disclose
their weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and other confidential or
proprietary business information to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>-some of whom were
business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>. In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were reluctant to share
information due to concerns that an inadvertent release of this
type of information could damage reputations; lower customer
confidence; provide an advantage to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>; and possibly
negatively affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and lead to punitive measures
against an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> or a member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> had to be built over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and through personal relationships, and they had taken various
steps to facilitate the process, such as the following:


â¢
Most held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">regular-bimonthly</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX>, or
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX>-meetings or forums to discuss issues and establish
face-to-face contact. Beyond the time used to discuss technical
issues, these meetings included time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to build personal
relationships and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> stated that the personal relationships and contacts
developed through participating in information-sharing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> was as important, if not more important, in
developing trust than the information received by attending an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s function.


â¢
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> encouraged consistent member
participation, noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> was built most effectively when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> consistently attended and participated in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>' activities. Also important was for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to
consistently send the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> and not rotate different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>' functions. To
maintain consistency, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> did not allow alternate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendees</ENAMEX> when designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> could not
attend.


â¢
Most followed established procedures or performed
background checks to evaluate prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> before allowing
their participation. For example, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> allowed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonmembers</ENAMEX> to participate only if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> invited them or
an existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> invited and escorted them. Another organization
had an official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> that reviewed membership applications to
determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicant</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicant</ENAMEX>'s organization
met established membership criteria. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that served
specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> had established lists of pertinent organizations
that were allowed to participate as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and receive information
of specific interest to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.


â¢
Many attempted to establish an atmosphere of mutual
respect among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> so that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>'s issues and
expertise merited consideration regardless of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> they
represented or the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>'s position in that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Often, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> was required to share information or,
in some cases, time was set aside to give each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> an
opportunity to raise issues for discussion. In addition, many
organizations encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to subordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> or
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> to the interests of the entire
information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. For example, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> had simple
rules of behavior. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> were to support one another in improving
the security posture of each other's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> without regard
for their own self-promotion or for the profit or publicity of
their individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.


â¢
All had established procedures for handling violations of
the rules because any violation of trust undermined the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s purpose and diminished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' willingness to share
in the future. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had both formal and informal means
of encouraging compliance and sanctioning violators. In some cases,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were formally asked to terminate their participation, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>'s access was terminated, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> was
asked to replace its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>. For example, one organization
would restrict access to a secure server, thereby terminating the
individual's ability to share or



Establish <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mechanisms For Effective</ENAMEX>,
Timely, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriately Secure Communication</ENAMEX>
receive information. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Informally</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> would no longer
include a violator in sensitive conversations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>
emphasized that once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> lost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> could
not be easily restored. Our study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> said that their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> rarely experienced a violation of trust because
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> did not want to jeopardize their ability to participate
and, thus, lose the benefits of membership.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> used a variety of mechanisms to ensure
effective and timely communication among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and with the
professional and administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> that some of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> had established. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were
concerned about appropriately securing the information being shared
to maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> anonymity, when desired, and avoid
inappropriately disseminating sensitive or proprietary information
to nonmembers.
Regularly scheduled meetings were the primary method for sharing
information as well as a method for building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX>, as previously
discussed. These meetings offered a generally secure environment to
share information, while also encouraging broader member
participation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also adjusted the meeting times
and lengths to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> needs and attempted to enhance
the meeting's efficiency and effectiveness by limiting the time for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">presentations</ENAMEX>, approving most topics and presentations before the
meetings, and adjusting meeting times to maximize face-to-face
discussions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
Typically, the meetings lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1/2 day to 2 days</TIMEX> for the entire
membership, and some meetings included separate sessions for
smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to discuss specific technical or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> issues. For
example, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly 2-day</TIMEX> meetings, the first
day of which was typically restricted to a small number of members
with expertise pertinent to the specific topic under discussion.
These closed meetings tended to be more technical than the open
meetings and include information and discussions that were more
sensitive and detailed. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second day</TIMEX>'s meeting, which was for all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, included discussions about the latest
software tools and the latest technology and allowed time for any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> to openly discuss specific topics. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> held
more informal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly half-day</TIMEX> meetings that included
presentations about a wide variety of topics and allowed
considerable time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to develop personal contacts and have
face-to-face discussions. Beyond the regularly scheduled meetings,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> to perform specific
tasks, such as policy setting, that allowed for greater contact
between some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and more topic-based information sharing.
Various types of information technology provided important
communication mechanisms as well. For example, Web sites were used
to
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) disseminate all types of information, including alerts,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">advisories</ENAMEX>, reports, and other analysis; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) make databases
available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) provide methods for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to
ask each other about particular incidents, vulnerabilities, or
potential solutions. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had secure Web sites to
share sensitive information; others used open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> to share
general information with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and the public. One
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> established a secure telephone line that allowed
immediate contact with multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, thereby speeding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> of timecritical information. In addition, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> used e-mail to communicate less sensitive information
to the entire membership. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from one organization
did not typically use e-mail because of the lack of security and
the inability to control subsequent distribution. This organization
relied primarily on regular mail and telephone conversations to
disseminate information about most things, including meeting
agendas and real-time problem solving.
Due to concerns about the inadvertent release of sensitive
information, membership lists, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> identification, some of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had implemented special security procedures. For
example, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> carefully sanitized victim
identifiers from documentation or did not document discussions
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> specific vulnerabilities and incidents. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> took
special precautions to hide the identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> by limiting its
staff's access to the information and segregating the information
on a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s membership list was
maintained by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and never generally released to all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> stated that an underlying requirement
for communications was establishing standard terms and reporting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thresholds</ENAMEX> so that the magnitude of an incident could be easily and
consistently understood and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> could quickly determine an
incident's potential impact on them. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>,
such standardization helped to ensure that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> understood
the level of risk imposed by the circumstance, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) information was
appropriately sanitized to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>'s identity, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
solutions were easily understood. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> had developed an
extensive policy that defined each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>'s responsibility for
reporting information, the terms that would be used for the
reporting, and the thresholds that required reporting. Also, two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> were developing reporting forms to standardize the
mechanism and language used to report incidents to the organization
for further analysis and dissemination.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> sought member input in developing new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and mechanisms for communicating information, thereby
better fulfilling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> needs and giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> a sense of
ownership in the system or product. For example, one organization
solicited suggestions about how to improve existing databases and
what new databases were needed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> told us that senior management
support for their participation in an information-sharing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> was critical to their success in obtaining valuable
information and contributing to the success of the entire
information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> approval
was needed before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> could share information about
potentially sensitive incidents and vulnerabilities. Without such
support, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> could not fully participate in the
information-sharing process. Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> support was also needed
to ensure that a member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> could obtain
funding for travel and other resources. For example, two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> charged membership fees-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>-and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> requested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to provide support
staff and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>.


Obtain Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> Support
Ensure <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leadership Continuity</ENAMEX>
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who had spent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> building personal relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and working to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">champion</ENAMEX> the purpose and mission of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. In our
discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were given considerable
credit for the quality and value of the information that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> received and the success of the information-sharing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>. These long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> told us that, to help ensure
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">continuity</ENAMEX> and diminish reliance on a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, they
attempted to institutionalize their roles by bringing in additional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to assist in leading their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and performing such
duties as enforcing membership rules and keeping current on issues
and topics affecting their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
Generate Clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> said that generating clearly identifiable benefits
was essential for maintaining active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> participation and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Identifiable Membership</ENAMEX>
Benefits support in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Many representatives
told us that due to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' own resource and time constraints,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> would not participate in information-sharing organizations
unless they received benefits. Benefits the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> cited
included the following:


â¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> were provided access to current information about
incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities that had been analyzed by
trusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>. Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> performed expert
analysis on incidents reported to them by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> or the public and
provided analyses and alerts to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that included
information on the incident's level of threat and any possible
mitigation techniques. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> provided its members
with a method for soliciting advice from the entire membership. In
this case, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> would send a query to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, who would review the request, clarify any questions with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, and then send the request to the rest of the
membership. While the rest of the membership reviewed and commented
on the query, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> continued to analyze the
problem, eventually providing its final analysis, which could
include a threat rating and potential solutions to the entire
membership. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> stated that the amount of analysis
performed before informing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had to be balanced with the
need to quickly warn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> about the potential threat.
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> stated that sharing information for the sake
of sharing was not valuable because information security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> need analyses that offer solutions.


â¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> were informed about emerging technology so that
they could discuss or at least be aware of possible vulnerabilities
and the associated risks. These discussions were valuable to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> because the information was useful in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>'s
planning efforts. For example, several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had
recently discussed, or were planning to discuss, the
vulnerabilities surrounding the use of wireless networking
technology.


â¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> shared information concerning information
security management practices, including corporate governance
practices, business risk management processes, computing and
network contract provisions, application development and support,
disaster recovery planning, and performance measurement regarding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> effectiveness.


â¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> shared lessons learned and offered free expert
advice on individual projects. The opportunity to draw on a network
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> insight into their own problems and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shortfalls</ENAMEX> in proposed projects. For example, in many cases, one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were willing to help each other by reviewing
the requirement documentation for new systems development projects
or system enhancement projects and participate in meetings to
expose weaknesses and raise questions about a proposed project.
According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> had received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> worth of free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> advice during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half-day</TIMEX>
discussion of a proposed information system that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> was
developing. The discussion led to the development of a better, more
secure system. The sharing of free advice also occurred more
informally.


â¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> received real-time assistance in response to
problems. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> experienced a
sophisticated network intrusion that was originating from a foreign
Internet service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>. Through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> made at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, the system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> was
able to contact the Internet service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> and stop the
intrusion. According to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> involved, this incident was
stopped much faster than it otherwise would have been because of
the trusted relationships developed through the information-sharing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> that allowed open and candid discussions to
occur.


â¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> established more cooperative relationships with
law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enforcement entities</ENAMEX> than would have otherwise occurred. Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> were sponsored by law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and
most included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from the law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Although
law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enforcement organizations</ENAMEX> could not share certain sensitive
information, including them in the information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> led
to trusted relationships between law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and
the others; shared expertise about computer forensics and evidence
gathering related to electronic crimes; and, thus, awareness about
these topics, which encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to report crimes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> told us that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' ability to
properly gather and protect computer-related evidence had
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilitated</ENAMEX> law enforcement investigations, thus limiting the time
and resources that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> and the law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>
needed to carry out an investigation. In addition, the trusted
relationships provided law enforcement with a greater pool of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to use as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert witnesses</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>.


â¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> developed valuable professional relationships
through participation. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that participated in our study
stated that their exposure to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and cutting-edge
technology was a valuable learning experience that increased their
own technical expertise. In addition, the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> developed by participating assisted their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> in identifying potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> to fill open
positions.


â¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> told us that they believed that the information
sharing their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> engaged in contributed to the overall
security of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s critical infrastructures-an effort that
they viewed as being in their own self-interest, as well as that of
others.


In addition to the critical success factors
previously discussed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> identified a number of related
challenges to effective information sharing. These challenges
included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) initially establishing and maintaining trust
relationships, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) developing agreements on the use and protection
of shared information, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) obtaining adequate funding, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
developing and retaining a membership base, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) developing and
maintaining an organization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with appropriate skills.



Challenges to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Building</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maintaining Effective Information</ENAMEX>
Sharing

Initially Establishing and Maintaining
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trust Relationships</ENAMEX>
All of the participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> told us that initially
establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> among the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> was a challenge. This
was because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were reluctant to share their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
problems and vulnerabilities with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX>, some of whom were
commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> stated that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meetings
discussed broad subjects that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were concerned about or
equally affected by, such as computer forensics.
In some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> initially participated because of an
existing trust relationship with individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX>,
and it was a challenge to keep them returning until they saw value
in participating and had built <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. In such
situations, the persistence of trusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in encouraging
effective member participation was essential.
Over time, this challenge diminished as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> became familiar
with each other, enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> moved past general topics,
and rules of behavior were clarified. In addition, over time,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> began to better understand the perspectives of others. For
example, discussions among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> gradually led those from the
private sector to gain an


Developing Agreements on the Use and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protection of Shared Information</ENAMEX>
understanding of the law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s approach to
investigating crime. Further, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
said that it took time for them to determine how they could share
sensitive, including classified, information with nonfederal
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
Another challenge, previously mentioned, was the need to
institutionalize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX>, rather than depend indefinitely on personal
one-on-one relationships. Institutionalizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> was especially
important for large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that
typically experienced a great deal of staff turnover.
Information sharing is impeded when there is a lack of clearly
understood agreements and expectations on how potentially sensitive
information will be used and protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. To
overcome this obstacle, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> required members
to sign confidentiality or informationsharing agreements. These
agreements varied among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>: some agreements were
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, while others were specific. Though many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> did not consider these agreements to be essential,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> considered them important
because they clarified and helped to institutionalize agreements,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ensured</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> understanding and support, and fostered
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. For example, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> determined
that more formal agreements were needed when its membership was
significantly expanded. The more formal agreements helped ensure
that new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s practices,
which had previously been informal and undocumented. These new
agreements described how the sensitivity of information would be
defined, how shared information would be protected from
dissemination outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and what information could be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> with nonmembers.
Noting that information-sharing agreements cannot cover every
situation that may arise, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> emphasized the
importance of promoting an attitude of sensitivity to the concerns
of others regarding disclosure of potentially confidential or
damaging information. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> described a
situation in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had notified them of a newly
identified vulnerability. Before disseminating information on the
vulnerability to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent members</ENAMEX>, the information-sharing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> worked with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to develop a message that
would provide the needed vulnerability information but not disclose
sensitive details. This collaborative effort helped ensure and
maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had
raised concerns about their potential liability for any damage that
occurred as a result of the information they shared and the advice
they gave. Specifically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were concerned that they might be
held liable if other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> took their advice and experienced
negative results. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> were also
concerned that they might be held responsible if their advice
adversely affected a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>. To mitigate the risk of any such
liability, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> addressed this issue specifically in
their information-sharing agreements, stating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who took
the advice of others did so at their own risk. In addition, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of federally sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> expressed the concern
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' potentially sensitive information voluntarily shared
with federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> could be required to be made publicly
available under provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Freedom of Information Act</ENAMEX>,
despite existing exemptions for sensitive or proprietary
information.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also faced challenges
obtaining adequate funding for various items, including mailings;
meeting space; technological enhancements; and other administrative
activities and, when applicable, salaries for permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. They
noted that the funding must be reliable so that the organization
could plan, budget, and remain consistent in its activities. For
example, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> had to stop development of a secure Web
site because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> withdrew its support. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representatives</ENAMEX> from
several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that relied on voluntary contributions from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> emphasized, however, that such funding must be
unbiased-that is, used for promoting open and honest information
sharing rather than furthering an individual's or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
stature in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> or for gaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.

Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> said that they had to work to overcome
the challenge of maintaining their memberships' enthusiasm and
participation so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> would use the communication
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mechanisms</ENAMEX>, maintain confidentiality, and continue to share
relevant information. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had to solicit new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to stay at their chartered number and to keep an influx of
new ideas.
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that strictly controlled their membership
or the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, developing and maintaining their
membership base was a formidable challenge. For these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (e.g., due to the loss of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' management support or difficult


Developing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maintaining Appropriate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytical and Administrative Skills</ENAMEX>
economic times) threatened their survival. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>,
this meant that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> had to continually establish contacts
in their industry and determine which prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> would
provide the most benefit to the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that focused on the information
technology area faced the challenge of a very transient membership
because information technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> often moved from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> moved, the
information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had to determine if they would be
allowed to continue participating, which was usually based on the
contributions and the enthusiasm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> usually allowed individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who had changed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> to continue participation. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
specifically did not allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to continue participating if
they changed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> and their new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> was not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> because their membership was based on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> faced the challenge of developing and
maintaining an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> with the appropriate operational skills
to facilitate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' participation and oversee administrative
activities that ensured continued and effective information
sharing. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that had professional and
administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> said that it was difficult to find and retain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with the level of skills and foresight that would
contribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s mission. Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were
expected to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in participating in information sharing
by arranging meetings and travel, maintaining the communications
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mechanisms</ENAMEX>, and keeping abreast of current and emerging issues.
Further, to build trusted relationships and gain the acceptance of
member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> needed to have pertinent skills and
knowledge.
Because the job market was so competitive, one of the sponsoring
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">organizations</ENAMEX> established flexible working arrangements for and
gave competitive pay to their professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> that supported its
informationsharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> recruited
staff from its industry who had relevant technical experience and
understood the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s role in the industry. In addition,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> to maintain its
communications mechanisms and analyze reported incidents.



Information on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Critical Success Factors</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Challenges Can Benefit Critical Infrastructure Protection</ENAMEX>
In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> without
professional and administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> believed that an even more
difficult challenge was encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> to donate additional
time to perform the administrative tasks required to organize
meetings and further facilitate information sharing. In one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> had taken most of the responsibility for
these tasks.
Information sharing and coordination among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are
important aspects of producing comprehensive and practical
approaches to combating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">computer-based attacks</ENAMEX>. Information on
threats and incidents experienced by others can help an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> identify trends, better understand the risks it faces,
and determine what preventative measures should be implemented. In
addition, comprehensive, timely information on incidents can help
federal and nonfederal analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> determine the nature of an
attack, provide warnings, and advise on how to mitigate an imminent
attack.
The critical success factors and challenges described by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> experienced in sharing sensitive and time-critical
information and the lessons they have learned provide useful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insights</ENAMEX> for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> who are also trying to develop means of
appropriately sharing information on computer-based vulnerabilities
and the related risks. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s critical infrastructure
protection strategy evolves, both public and privatesector entities
can adopt the practices described to


â¢
establish trusted relationships with a wide variety of
federal and nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that may be in a position to
provide potentially useful information and advice on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vulnerabilities</ENAMEX> and incidents;


â¢
develop standards and agreements on how shared
information will be used and protected;


â¢
establish effective and appropriately secure
communication mechanisms;


â¢
take steps to ensure that sensitive information is not
inappropriately disseminated, which may require statutory
changes;


â¢
ensure that benefits are realized by developing and
maintaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with the skills to support analytical
capabilities and facilitate communication among information-sharing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>;


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â¢</ENAMEX> obtain the support of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in both federal and
nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>; and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â¢</ENAMEX> obtain adequate funding.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can play a key role in facilitating the
information-sharing aspect of critical infrastructure protection,
as it did regarding the Year <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> computing challenge. For example,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can actively monitor progress in meeting critical
infrastructure protection goals, including improved information
sharing, and promote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> by assisting in clarifying the way
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> may use sensitive information provided for
critical infrastructure protection purposes. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Prior to 2000</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> held important hearings on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year 2000</TIMEX> readiness, and, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, passed legislation intended to address <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> from
private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> about exposure to legal liability and
antitrust law violations that might arise due to sharing
information on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year 2000</TIMEX> readiness.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is currently considering measures intended to
address several of the practices and challenges we identified. Two
recently introduced bills, S. 1456 and H.R. 2435, include
provisions that address the receipt, care, and storage of critical
infrastructure protection information as well as specific
exemptions from public disclosure of such information.
Implementation of such provisions, as well as other monitoring
actions, could facilitate information sharing and, thus, federal
and private efforts to protect critical infrastructures.

Objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
Our overall objective was to identify information-sharing
practices that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and others can adopt to
improve their ability to understand, anticipate, and address
computer-based vulnerabilities and incidents. Our specific
objectives were to identify (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) critical success factors in
building information-sharing relationships and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) related
challenges and how to address them.
To meet these objectives, we studied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> federal and nonfederal
entities experienced in developing relationships and procedures for
information sharing. We identified these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> by
soliciting suggestions from a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, including our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> familiar with information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Council on Information Management</ENAMEX> and
Technology, which is a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> with extensive
experience in information technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> who advise us on
major information management issues affecting federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> recommended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 30</NUMEX> public and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
After initial discussions and further research, we narrowed our
focus to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that most closely met our criteria of
being a recognized, competent information-sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, primarily
sharing sensitive or timecritical information pertaining to
computer-based vulnerabilities and incidents.
These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> included among their membership
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from federal, state, and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>; private
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> of varying sizes; and the academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who were involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had various
technical and business backgrounds-such as information security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>, computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, law
enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> covered by our review is described in Appendix
II.
To identify common critical success factors, we researched each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, analyzed relevant documents, interviewed pertinent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, observed meetings
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, and compared their experiences for
similarities. To identify challenges associated with successful
information sharing, we obtained the views of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and members
of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and reviewed supporting documentation, when it
was available.
We solicited comments from each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that
we studied. Additional supporting points and examples were
incorporated as
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix I Objectives, Scope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
appropriate. We conducted our study from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX> through
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2001</TIMEX> in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study of Information Sharing</ENAMEX>
The Agora
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>-based regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 600</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> representing a variety of fields, including
information systems security; law enforcement; local, state, and
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>; engineering; information technology;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX>; and other specialties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> represent over
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> located in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Provinces</ENAMEX>.
Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> formed to address the enormous
security challenges brought about by new computer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, and
Internet technologies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX>'s objectives are to


â¢
establish confidential ways for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to share
sensitive information about common problems and best practices for
dealing with security threats,


â¢
develop and share knowledge about how to protect
electronic infrastructures,


â¢
establish shared services that enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>'
ability to successfully perform their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> jobs,


â¢
prompt more research specific to electronic information
systems security,


â¢
share educational opportunities, and


â¢
enjoy the benefits of the fostered
relationships.


Information sharing occurs primarily through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> meetings
that typically include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. In addition to the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> meetings, informal meetings and teleconferences are held
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> on an ad hoc basis to discuss issues as they arise,
such as assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> under attack.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and
Prevention
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>), which is
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>, is
recognized as the lead federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> for protecting the health and
safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at home and abroad. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> seeks to accomplish its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> by working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> and world to

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Web</ENAMEX>
foster safe and healthful environments, and provide leadership
and training.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> uses several information-sharing computer systems to help
accomplish its mission, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of which were covered by our review
and are described below.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> officially announced the establishment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PulseNet</ENAMEX>,
a national network of public health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> that helps
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">epidemiologists</ENAMEX> rapidly identify clusters of foodborne illness and
alerts others in the surrounding geographic area and throughout the
country regarding a possible outbreak. By sharing information on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outbreaks</ENAMEX> quickly through computer systems connected to the
Internet, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PulseNet</ENAMEX> allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> to very quickly notify public health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of the health threat and assist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in identifying and removing the food source of the
outbreak from distribution channels, thus mitigating the health
risks associated with such outbreaks.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemic Information Exchange</ENAMEX> system was
implemented as an interactive, secure, Internet-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> that
provides information on epidemic outbreaks, toxic exposures, and
other health events as they occur. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemic Intelligence Service</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX>, state and local laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and other
public health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> use the system to securely conduct on-line
discussions about posted events, communicate with public health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and request both financial and nonfinancial assistance.
Because of the sensitivity of the system's information, both users
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> of the information must be granted access to the
system. In addition, before the information is made available to
the system's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, who is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, review the information to ensure accurate information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Web</ENAMEX>, jointly developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Census</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX>, is a newly implemented system for cataloging and sharing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> science data across the Internet. In this regard, the Data
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Web</ENAMEX> brings together demographic, economic, environmental, health,
and other data maintained on different systems by different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> wishing to make available their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX>-science-related data to a wide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> using a variety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.
The primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Web</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>,

access to government and scientific data originating from
diverse systems and disciplines. While most data are widely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accessible</ENAMEX>, the system provides a means for data <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to
restrict access to sensitive information.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">CERTÂ® Coordination Center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CERT</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/CC</ENAMEX>) was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is
charged with


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
establishing a capability to quickly and effectively
coordinate communication among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to limit the damage
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with, and respond to, computer-based incidents; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
conducting research into the prevention of security incidents; and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) building awareness of security issues across the Internet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. In this role, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CERT/CC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) receives from and provides to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>, technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, and policy
makers Internet security-related information and


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
provides guidance and coordination for responding to
major Internet security events, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melissa</ENAMEX> virus and Year
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> conversion challenge. The center attempts to be an unbiased
and trusted source of information, in part by providing trend and
composite information only, by deleting information that would
allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> to be identified, and by coordinating the response
information it provides with academic, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, and corporate

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Computer Incident Response</ENAMEX>
Center
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Computer Incident Response Center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FedCIRC</ENAMEX>) is the
focal point for dealing with computer-related incidents affecting
federal civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Originally established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of Standards and Technology</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> has been
administered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FedCIRC</ENAMEX>'s primary purposes are to provide a means for federal
civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to work together to handle security incidents,
share related information, and solve common security problems. In
this regard, FedCIRC


â¢
provides federal civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with technical
information, tools, methods, assistance, and guidance;


â¢
provides coordination and analytical support;

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> continuously carry on dialogs through queries on
information security policy, procedure, and technology management
issues, moderated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-4</ENAMEX> staff.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National InfraGard Program</ENAMEX> began as a
pilot project in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> in the


InfraGard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland FBI Field Office</ENAMEX> to build a better relationship
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the private sector in addressing cyber and
physical threats. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Infrastructure Protection Center</ENAMEX>,
which is an interagency center housed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, in conjunction
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from private industry, the academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, has worked to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">InfraGard</ENAMEX> by encouraging
development of local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> associated with each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>
field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InfraGard</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 2,000</NUMEX> members
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InfraGard</ENAMEX> chapters establish direct contact between law
enforcement and infrastructure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>, such as
utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, through periodic
meetings and a secure Web site. These communication mechanisms
allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InfraGard</ENAMEX> to

Operations
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations</ENAMEX> (JTF-CNO)
(formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Task Force-Computer Network</ENAMEX> Defense) is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primary Department of Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> for coordinating and directing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> activities to detect computer-based attacks, contain
damage, and restore computer functionality when disruptions occur.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> to serve as one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> with
overall authority for directing defensive actions against
computer-based attacks across the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>. As such,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JTF-CNO</ENAMEX> is supported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments of the Army</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> computer emergencyresponse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and
other Defense components.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JTF-CNO</ENAMEX>'s scope of responsibility was
expanded to include a new operational mission: computer network
attack. In addition to expanding mission responsibilities, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JTF-CNO</ENAMEX> is growing in size and depth to better meet increased
network defense responsibilities. The JTF-CNO expansion
significantly increases its ability to perform the following:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) preventive activities, such as conducting security reviews
and issuing vulnerability alerts; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) coordination and monitoring
detection activities performed by components, including monitoring
automated intrusiondetection systems; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) investigative and

In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCC</ENAMEX> was recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> as the information sharing and analysis
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> (ISAC) for the telecommunications sector. As such, the NCC

this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> to pool the expertise, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, and technical

internationally as a model for local interagency cooperation and
private/public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> has recently implemented
a similar model.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American Electric Reliability Council</ENAMEX> (NERC) was
formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX> power outage crippled much of the
northeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> is a voluntary organization
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> involved in bulk power production and distribution
to promote standards and procedures and improve the reliability of
the electric power supply. Due to the interconnectivity and
interdependency of the electric power grid, information sharing is
a necessity for (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) maintaining the reliability of the power supply
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) conducting business transactions in a deregulated
environment. NERC depends on reciprocity, peer pressure, and the
mutual self-interest of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to prevent any future
occurrence like the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX> incident. It also serves as an officially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognized ISAC</ENAMEX> for combating computer-based attacks on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> power industry. In this capacity, it cooperates with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal National Infrastructure Protection Center</ENAMEX> to identify
threat trends and vulnerabilities and disseminate assessments,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">advisories</ENAMEX>, and alerts to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NERC</ENAMEX> membership consists of representatives from each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">councils</ENAMEX> that represent geographic regions encompassing
the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and a small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
Because any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that is part of the power grid can
potentially affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> and stability of the entire grid,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of these regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">councils</ENAMEX> come from all segments of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> industry: investor-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX>; federal power
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>; rural electric power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cooperatives</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, municipal, and
provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX>; independent power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX>; power <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">marketers</ENAMEX>;
and other interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> primarily uses various databases accessible through
secure Web sites for disseminating and collecting shared
information on many aspects of energy generation and transfer. In
addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NERC</ENAMEX> allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to create <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> designed to
solve particular problems or support ongoing efforts, such as
standards setting and critical infrastructure protection.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mission</ENAMEX>
