<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> significant changes in work place habits and
technological advances have affected the manner in which time and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attendance</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX>) reporting is accomplished. For example, more
flexible work schedules and places, and the trend in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to
streamline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> have provided a major impetus for changes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems. However, perhaps the most significant influence on
these changes is advancing technology and the increased use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">automation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Paperwork Elimination Act</ENAMEX> (GPEA)
encourages the movement toward paperless applications and the use
of electronic signatures. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPEA</ENAMEX> focuses on electronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> regarding information obtained from and provided to sources
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, it provides an additional impetus to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to seek further applications of paperless systems and use
of electronic signatures.
Trends toward increased automation and workplace flexibility
have changed the operating environment. However, the need for good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control continues to exist. To keep abreast of the
changes, especially those in automation, we have revised this
document to emphasize the attention that should remain regarding
effective internal control in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems. This document offers
suggestions for taking advantage of the advancements in automated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems and updates the previous guidance to incorporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX> offered in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> requests<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>
As advancing technologies continue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have greater
flexibility in designing and implementing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems best
suited for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. In designing and implementing new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems or components of existing systems, management
should strive for costbeneficial systems and related internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>.
The traditional work schedule followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian employees</ENAMEX>
differs from those generally followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> on active duty of
the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>. Because traditional work schedules influence
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems, this document contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX>
major parts, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dealing with civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who are
expected to be "working," usually during certain times and the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the active duty armed services
who are expected to be in a "duty status" and thus on call <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">part II</ENAMEX>, military service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, provides guidance

PART I: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTERNAL CONTROL OBJECTIVES IN T&A SYSTEMS</ENAMEX>
The primary objective of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> system is to ensure that
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> worked, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in pay status, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> absent are properly
reported. Reliable data are important to accurately compute and
account for computed pay, leave, and allowances. To achieve this
objective, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> should have in place an internal control
system that provides reasonable assurance that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) T&A
transactions are properly authorized and approved and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) T&A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are completely and accurately recorded and retained.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">T&A Transactions Are Properly Authorized and Approved</ENAMEX>
The nature and extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> transaction approvals and
controls can vary among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems. Fully automated systems,
for example, may require fewer approvals than manual systems
because of automated edits and controls, and the use of automated
signatures. Nevertheless, the nature and extent of T&A
approvals must be such that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> has assurance that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervisors</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> know they are accountable for the
approvals of an employee's work time and absences. This helps
ensure that accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> information is recorded and reported
for the purposes of computing pay and allowances.
Primary responsibility for authorizing and approving T&A
transactions rests with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, who approves the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> reports. Timekeepers3 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> must be
aware of the work time and absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> for whom they are
responsible to ensure the reliability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data. To the
extent practical, changes to an employee's normal work schedule
should generally be approved prior to the change actually
occurring. Unanticipated changes should be reviewed for approval or
disapproval as soon as reasonably possible.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A Data Are Complete</ENAMEX> and Accurate
Because most federal civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are paid on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hourly</TIMEX>
basis (or fractions of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>) and earn and charge leave on that
basis, a complete and accurate record of the time an employee works
must be retained as an official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> record available for review
or inspection. To provide a basis for pay, leave, and benefits, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> must include aggregate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of regular time, other time
(e.g., <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overtime</TIMEX>, credit <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, or compensatory time), and leave<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
To help ensure accuracy, the completed records must be reviewed and
approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> (or other equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>). In an
automated environment, system edits and other automated tests
can

The traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T&A</ENAMEX> system normally involved a timekeeper
who was responsible for assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> in recording and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">verifying</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' work time and absences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New T&A</ENAMEX> systems
can reduce or even eliminate timekeepers' duties and shift the
responsibilities to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX>. Regardless of the
changes made, recording accurate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> information remains the
primary control objective.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
Traditionally, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> arrival and departure times were required
to be recorded. Although it is not required that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> records be
maintained, agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> may choose to do so by using
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">signin/signout</ENAMEX> sheets or other means.
assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> in his or her review and verify that
recorded work time is accurate and allowable.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RELIANCE ON INTERNAL CONTROLS IN A T&A SYSTEM</ENAMEX>
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems evolve toward increasingly automated methods
of recording and reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> work and leave times, it is
important to implement and maintain a welldefined system that
provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> with the confidence that controls are working
as designed. This can be done by:


•
Having a welldefined organizational structure and flow of
T&A data with clearly written policies and procedures setting
forth the responsibilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, timekeepers (if
applicable), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> regarding recording, examining, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">approving T&A</ENAMEX> transactions.


•
Effectively applying available technology and concepts to
achieve efficient and effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> processes in
accordance with applicable requirements and the environment in
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> operates.


•
Having the ability to record payroll costs by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appropriation</ENAMEX>, organizational code, and work activity to facilitate
application of required cost accounting for financial and program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.


•
Reviewing and testing all aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems'
processing procedures and controls in sufficient scope, depth, and
frequency to provide reasonable assurance that key procedures and
controls are working and effective and that data integrity is
maintained.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies' T&A</ENAMEX> systems are subject to periodic review under
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Managers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Financial Integrity Act of 1982</ENAMEX> (FMFIA) (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>

retained electronically, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) a combination of automated and
manual records. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> information can be obtained using a
number of different methods, including but not limited to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">preprinted</ENAMEX> or designed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> forms; other standard forms;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> memorandums; emails; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>, timekeeper, or supervisor

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. The data contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> records should be
linked to accounting records and provide the necessary support for
financial reporting and allocation of costs.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recording T&A Data</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> policy must affix accountability for recording the
T&A data referred to in the previous section. The data may be
recorded by the

individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>,


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, or


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
a combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> policy must assign accountability for recording and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maintaining T&A</ENAMEX> data referred to in the previous section. If
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> is not recording his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data, the basis
for recording the data could be (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">timekeeper</ENAMEX>'s or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>'s observation, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) time clocks, or other automated
timekeeping devices, where not prohibited by law, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) other
applicable techniques. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> recording the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data
acknowledges responsibility for the accuracy of the recorded
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
The point at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data are recorded can vary among
different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data may be
recorded (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) when deviations occur from an individual's
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s established work schedule, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) at the end of the pay
period. Regardless of the timing of recording <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> must have in place a system of control techniques that
gives reasonable assurance that the recorded information reflects
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> worked, leave taken, or other absences.
6Cumulative balances of available leave by type per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> are
required to be maintained on record. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies</ENAMEX> may maintain these
cumulative balances on biweekly or pay period <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> records which
show the available balances for the pay period ending. Examples of
the types of leave on such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> records include, but are not
limited to, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX>, sick, and family friendly leave.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary T&A Records</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary T&A</ENAMEX> records, containing information not

Attestations, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Verifications</ENAMEX>, and Approvals
This section (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) defines attestations, verifications, and
approvals and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) discusses how attestations, verifications, and
approvals can be achieved in a manual or automated T&A system
environment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attestation</ENAMEX> refers to an employee affirming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data to be
true, correct, and accurate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verification</ENAMEX> is a confirmation,
usually by the timekeeper or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, that recorded information
is true, correct, and accurate to the best of his/her knowledge.
Approval is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>'s, other equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>'s, or
higher level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>'s agreement, ratification, or concurrence
to

understanding of his/her responsibility when approving T&A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
The evidence of attestations, verifications, and approvals will
of necessity differ between manual and automated systems. In manual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, attestations, verifications, and approvals are usually
shown by a signature or initial of an individual on a hard copy
document. In automated systems, they are represented by what can be
referred to generically as electronic signatures<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> There are many
types of electronic signature technologies offering different
degrees of confidence, control, and security. In selecting and/or
developing, and implementing a particular electronic signature
technology for an automated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> application, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> must
assess the risks associated with the loss, misuse, or compromise of
the electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> information and signatures compared to the
benefits, costs, and effort associated with selecting and/or
developing and managing the automated systems and electronic
signatures<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> See the appendix for a further explanation about
electronic signatures and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s review of such applications.

program, an employee's work schedule should be approved by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> or the official most knowledgeable of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s
schedule in advance of the period when the plan takes effect. If
the schedule is not approved in advance, the plan should be
approved as soon after the start of the pay period as possible.
Approval must be granted for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overtime</TIMEX> before the work has been
performed when feasible and, when not feasible, as soon as possible
after the work has been performed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> must be taken to
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">distinguish</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between regular overtime</TIMEX> and irregular overtime or
occasional overtime (or compensatory time in lieu of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overtime</TIMEX>,
where allowed) in order for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to properly document and
calculate an employee's overtime pay entitlements under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX>
chapters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55 and 61 and 29</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. 201 et</ENAMEX> seq.


Approval of Leave
Approval of leave should be made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s supervisor
before the leave is taken. If leave is not approved in advance, it
should be reviewed for approval or disapproval as soon as
reasonably possible after taken.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPEA</ENAMEX> defines "electronic signature" as a method of signing
an electronic message that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) identifies and authenticates a
particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> as the source of the electronic message and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
indicates such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s approval of the information contained in
the message.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPEA</ENAMEX> requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to comply with the guidance issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>
regarding automated systems that maintain electronic information as
a substitute for paper and use of electronic signatures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> issued
the guidance in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Memorandum M0010</ENAMEX>, dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 25, 2000</TIMEX>. A 29page
attachment to the memorandum contains the details of the guidance.
Also, as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> guidance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX> was
charged with developing practical guidance on legal considerations
related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' use of electronic filing and record keeping.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> issued LegalConsiderationsinDesigningandImplementing
ElectronicProcesses:<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGuideforFederalAgenciesin</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2000</TIMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attestation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Verification</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> and Timekeepers
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> and timekeeper, if any, are not required to attest
or verify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> reports and related documents. However, if
management requires such attestations and/or verifications, they
should be performed as close to the end of the pay period as
possible. When not possible until after the end of the pay period,
a copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> report and related documents, when
applicable, should be provided to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> promptly for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attestation</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">timekeeper</ENAMEX> promptly for verification. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> and/or timekeeper should promptly disclose any
discrepancies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> should promptly
resolve such discrepancies.


Approval of T&A Reports and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Related Records</ENAMEX>
All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> reports and related supporting documents (e.g.,
overtime pay authorizations) must be reviewed and approved by an
authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> and approval should be made by the
official, normally the immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, most knowledgeable of
the time worked and absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> involved. Approval of
T&A reports and related documents should be based on personal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, work output, timekeeper verification, checking data
against other independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, reliance on other controls, or a
combination of these methods.
The official most knowledgeable of the time worked should
approve any overtime or compensatory time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> should be taken (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
to ensure that the overtime was approved, preferably in advance,
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) that the amount and type of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overtime</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular</TIMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irregular</ENAMEX>), credit <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, and compensatory time is accurately
recorded.
If practical, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data must be approved at the end of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last day</TIMEX> of the pay period or later. When this is not feasible
because of payroll processing requirements to meet established
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paydays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data must be prepared and approved as close to the
end of the pay period as possible to still allow processing of the
payroll by payday.


Adjustment <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">or Corrections After the T&A Period Ends</ENAMEX>
Adjustments or corrections required because of changes after
T&A data were approved must be made in the payroll system and
reflected in pay for the pay period to which the changes apply,
when possible. When not possible, adjustments must be made as soon
after discovery as practical. Any changes must be approved by an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authorizing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> before being entered into the payroll
system.


SelfApproval of T&A Reports
In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> may not approve their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> (or designee) may authorize
particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to approve their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data in certain
situations or if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> is a high level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> (such as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>). In these situations,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> authorized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> head (or designee) must grant
advance authority in writing, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> must ensure that
effective controls are in place to ensure the proper reporting of
T&A data.
Exceptions to the general prohibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> approving
their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data are intended to apply when it is not
feasible to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data approved by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>. These
exceptions include but are not necessarily limited to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
working alone at a remote site for long periods and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
based at the same duty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> or timekeepers
but frequently at work sites away from the duty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. In other
situations when it is not practical for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> to approve
T&A data promptly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> may be paid and the supervisor
may subsequently review and approve the data.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRANSMITTING T&A INFORMATION TO PAYROLL</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> information must be transmitted to the payroll system
for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> or, under exceptionbased systems, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
who have changes to their normal work schedules. While the choice
of methods used to transmit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data may be based on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costeffectiveness</ENAMEX> and management information needs, the system used
to transmit the information must protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data from
unauthorized change or alteration and must generate a record of any
change made. Any change to previously attested to and approved data
must be reviewed by and attested to by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> whose data was
changed. The changed data must also be reviewed by and approved by
an authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EXCEPTIONBASED SYSTEMS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exceptionbased T&A</ENAMEX> systems, as the name implies, require pay
period recording of arrival and departure times only if material
variances11 from preestablished work schedules occur. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX>'
schedules are established, either through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> designated
work schedules or by mutual agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' arrival and departure times for a pay
period are established, these schedules become the basis for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recorded T&A</ENAMEX> data unless material variances or deviations
occur. As previously noted, if no material variances occur, arrival
and departure times and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> worked per day need not be
recorded.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Material variances</ENAMEX> or deviations must be approved by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> before the change occurs, if feasible, or promptly after
occurring, if not feasible. As part of their approval of the
change, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designees</ENAMEX> must verify that the dates and
amounts of material changes have been recorded in the appropriate
T&A record. However, in either case (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material variance</ENAMEX> or no
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>) each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">T&A</ENAMEX> record must be approved by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> or comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>.
Several alternatives exist for recording changes to established
schedules. Changes can be noted by recording arrival and departure
times directly on an employee's time sheet, recording arrival and
departure times on a centrally maintained timein/timeout log used
by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, or noting the number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours and minutes</TIMEX> of the
deviation in a record that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> maintains. The method
selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to record the deviations should be the most
efficient and effective one under the circumstances.
Unless otherwise designated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, material variances or
deviations from an established schedule for recording purposes are
those that differ by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> or more during a planned workday or
flex day. However, if leave is used, a deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 1</NUMEX>
hour could be considered material. For example, if an employee
arrives <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> late, but works <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> past the planned
departure time, this would be considered an immaterial variation
and need not be recorded. On the other hand, if the employee
chooses to request <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> or sick leave rather than to work for the
time absent, then a material deviation for recording purposes has
occurred.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALTERNATIVE WORKPLACE ARRANGEMENTS</ENAMEX>
Alternative workplace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">arrangements12</TIMEX> involve working at
locations other than the traditional government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Locations
of alternative workplaces are usually the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or
telecenters<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> Although numerous benefits exist for both the agency
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> participating in alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">workplaces</ENAMEX> (such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> moral and lower commuting costs), flexible workplace is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> option, not an employee benefit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> who work at
alternative work sites should have a written agreement with their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors stipulating</ENAMEX>, among other items, the period of time the
agreement is in effect, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> will work at the
alternative site, work assignments and performance, work schedule,
and time and attendance.
As a basis for approving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> data, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> are required
to obtain reasonable assurance that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> working at remote
sites are working when scheduled and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> information
accurately reflects time worked and absences from scheduled tours
of duty. Numerous techniques are available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> to
obtain this assurance. For example, reviewing the work output of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> and occasional phone call or visits to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX>.
12
Other terms used to refer to alternative workplace arrangements
or locations of work are "flexible workplace," "flexiplace," and
"telecommuting."
13
Telecenters are facilities away from the traditional government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> that are equipped with workstations, telephones, and
computers among other items that are shared by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of
multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PART II</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL</ENAMEX>
Active military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> are considered to be on duty <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>. Because the nature of some military assignments makes a
confirmation of the presence at duty stations difficult, if not
impossible, the recording of presence for duty and of specific
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> during which duty is performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> is not required. This
is similar to exceptionbased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> systems explained earlier in
this document. Most active duty military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> follow
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exceptionbased</ENAMEX> systems. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> are expected to be aware
of the presence and absence of service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> for whom they are
responsible. When a service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">member</ENAMEX> is on temporary assignment to
another component of the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> or to a civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to which the service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">member</ENAMEX> is detailed must provide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and attendance recording for the service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> and report the
information to his or her home component promptly to facilitate
payment of basic pay and allowances by (or through) the home
component.
Absence reports must be maintained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to indicate those
service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who are to be charged leave and those who are not
present for duty but who should be. Examples of reports that might
contain such data are "morning" or "day" reports, strength reports,
unit diaries, and other similar reports.
Information on absences which affect pay should be compiled each
pay period and be transmitted to the payroll system. Without such
information, the payroll system may mistakenly pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> for
unauthorized pay and allowances. The following requirements for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and approval must be met:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Reports of such information and related supporting
documents must be reviewed and approved by a designated authorizing
official. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> must be aware of the responsibilities he or
she is taking regarding the accuracy of the reports.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Approvals of such reports will be made at the end of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last day</TIMEX> of the pay period whenever possible. When this is not
possible because of payroll processing requirements to meet
established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">paydays</TIMEX>, documents must be approved as close to the end
of the pay period as possible.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Approval must be done in accordance with guidance found
in the subsection "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Attestations, Verifications, and Approvals</ENAMEX>" of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Authorizing and Approving T&A Transactions</ENAMEX>" of this
document.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Any adjustments required because of changes in reported
absences after the reports were approved and transmitted to the
payroll system must be made and reflected in the pay period to
which the changes apply, when possible, or when not possible,
adjusted as soon as possible, preferably in the next pay
period.


Any changes must be approved by the authorizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> prior
to being entered into the payroll system. Service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may not
approve their own absence reports unless prior authority to do so
is granted in writing by an authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>.
When feasible (as in an office setting or environment),
costeffective, and applicable, attendance reporting and related
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> controls set forth in "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Part I: Civilian Employees"</ENAMEX> should
be instituted for service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to the extent management deems
appropriate.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MILITARY RESERVISTS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T&A</ENAMEX> controls for military reservists depend largely on the
nature of the work. If they have defined work schedules and are not
expected to be available for duty on a roundtheclock basis, the
T&A requirements for civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are operative and
should be used. If however they are employed similar to those who
are on active duty or are actually on active duty, then the
controls in the subsection "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Active Military Personnel</ENAMEX>" are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">operative</ENAMEX> and should be used.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APPENDIX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES</ENAMEX>
APPLICATIONS
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has been asked by several federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to review
electronic signature systems used in financial management systems
and to discuss how such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> should be evaluated. Because of
some of the unique risks associated with highly automated
environments, traditional data integrity techniques, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">password</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> identification based systems, used to
authenticate an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> may not provide the same degree of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> as that provided by paperbased systems. For example, in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paperbased</ENAMEX> system, an individual's signature on the paper document
is a timetested method of showing that an individual intended to be
bound by the terms and conditions in the paper document. However,
in an electronic world, where adequate controls have not been
implemented, the similar approach of having an individual's name
appended to a data record does not provide the same assurance
because, for example, the terms and conditions can be changed
without obtaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s approval of the changes
made.
When reviewing electronic signature systems, we evaluate whether
a system generates electronic signatures that represent an
individual's or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s intent to be bound. To do this, we
determine whether the electronic signature system provides
reasonable assurance that the signature produced by the system is
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) unique to the signer, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">signer</ENAMEX>'s sole control,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) capable of being verified, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) linked to the data in
such a manner that, if the data are changed, the signature is
invalidated. Adopting these criteria facilitates our evaluation of
how well the electronic signature system addresses its threats and
helps identify vulnerabilities that may be present in the system.
We have also found these criteria useful since they are technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">neutral</ENAMEX> (can be used regardless of the technology used to produce
the signature) and allow for a variety of implementation methods,
depending of the degree of risk associated with a given
application.
When deciding on an electronic signature system for T&A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should identify and/or develop and document the
criteria used in the selection of the signature system and how the
criteria and the selected system complies with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPEA</ENAMEX> definition
of an electronic signature. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s risk
assessment process (as called for in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">guidance14</ENAMEX>) should
disclose the risks considered that would prevent the system from
successfully complying with the criteria selected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>.
Without developing the criteria that the system should meet and
then effectively assessing the risks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> could adopt
signature systems that will not provide the necessary data
integrity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX>
