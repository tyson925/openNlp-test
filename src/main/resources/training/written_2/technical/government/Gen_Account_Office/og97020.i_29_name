Accounting Policies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derivative Financial Instruments</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derivative Commodity Instruments</ENAMEX>
Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(A) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>,
this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>), entitled "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disclosure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting</ENAMEX>
Policies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derivative Financial Instruments</ENAMEX> and Derivative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Instruments</ENAMEX>" (RIN: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3235-AG42</TIMEX>/RIN: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3235-AG77</TIMEX>). We received
the rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 3, 1997</TIMEX>. It was published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register</ENAMEX> as a final rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 10, 1997</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6044</TIMEX>.
This rule amends existing rules and forms for domestic and
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">issuers</ENAMEX> to clarify and expand disclosure requirements for
market risk sensitive instruments. The amendments also require
enhanced disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruments</ENAMEX> and derivative commodity instruments in the footnotes
to the financial statements. The amendments expand existing
disclosure requirements to include quantitative and qualitative
information about market risk inherent in market risk sensitive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruments</ENAMEX> and provide safe harbor protection to this information.
In the aggregate, these amendments are designed to provide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-20</NUMEX>
additional information about market risk sensitive instruments,
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> can use to better understand and evaluate the
market risk exposures of a registrant.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enclosed</ENAMEX> is our assessment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s compliance with the
procedural steps required by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)(i) through (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>)
of title <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> with respect to the rule. Our review indicates that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> complied with the applicable requirements.

(i)
Cost-benefit analysis

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> stated in its report to us that there is no
statutory mandate for it to prepare a cost-benefit analysis of a
rule. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 23</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Securities Exchange Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX> directs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> to consider the impact that any rule
will have on competition. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> states that it is adopting
these amendments and disclosure items in response to requests from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and others to provide more meaningful information about
various financial and commodity instruments. According to the
Commission, the expected benefits of these amendments are to
provide more complete information about market risk sensitive
instruments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> and others. This more complete disclosure
is expected to result in the markets operating more efficiently.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> believes that the benefits from the more complete
disclosure and increased market efficiency are expected to outweigh
the related costs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> also believes that the rule will
not impose any unnecessary or inappropriate burden on
competition.

Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
Act, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 603</ENAMEX>: Initial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
The proposed rulemaking, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">578</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 8, 1996</TIMEX>)
incorporated an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the
expected impact on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
The analysis provides the information required by paragraphs
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) through (b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>). It describes the reasons for the proposed
action, and its objectives and legal basis. It describes the small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX> (small business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">issuers</ENAMEX>) to which the rule will apply. It
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that the proposed rule does not conflict or overlap with
existing requirements, but rather tailors them for specific
purposes. The analysis further points out that it has reduced the
impact of the proposed amendments on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> by
determining not to amend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulation S-B</ENAMEX> to incorporate an item
similar to proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Item 305</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulation S-K.</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 604</ENAMEX>: Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
The preamble to the final rule contains a summary of the Final
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6062</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 10</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> submitted the entire analysis to us for our
review when it submitted its report on the rule.
As required by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 604</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> provided a
succinct statement of the need for, and the objectives of, the
rule.
Although no comments were filed that addressed the Initial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>, comments were received from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>. The analysis discusses the changes made to the proposed
rule as a result of the comments, including (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) extending the safe
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harbor</ENAMEX> to any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Item 305</ENAMEX> disclosure that is voluntarily provided by a
small business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">issuer</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) several changes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
believes should reduce the cost for all registrants preparing the
disclosures of quantitative information about market risk.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> also describes how excluding small business
issuers from all but the accounting policy disclosures required by
the rule limits substantially the application of the amendments to
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. It also states that the accounting policies
required by the new rule are clarifications of existing
requirements and should not require any additional recordkeeping or
bookkeeping.
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the

As an independent regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> is not
subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.

The final rule was promulgated using the notice and comment
procedures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">553</ENAMEX>. The notice of proposed rulemaking was
published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 8, 1996</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">578</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> comments to the proposed rulemaking. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commenters</ENAMEX> raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> relating to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) accounting policy, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
quantitative disclosures about market risk, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) qualitative
disclosures about market risk, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) implementation issues. The
Commission discusses its reaction to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>, and changes
made because of the comments, in the preamble to the rule published
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6062</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 10, 1997</TIMEX>).

According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, the amendments and disclosure items were
submitted for review to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> in
accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> and were approved by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> in accordance with the clearance procedures of that act (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. 3507).</ENAMEX> Because the various regulations, forms, and rules
that are being amended by this rulemaking already possessed OMB
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> numbers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> did not assign new control numbers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> stated that it also solicited comments on the
compliance burdens associated with the proposals but received no
public comment in response.
