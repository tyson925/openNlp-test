Evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Congressman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee</ENAMEX>:
I am pleased to appear before you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to discuss the work of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>). We welcome this opportunity to
highlight the important role that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> plays to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
for the benefit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
In my testimony <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, I will discuss the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">national</ENAMEX> and
international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> that confront our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,
the ways in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> can support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> now and in the
future, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s performance in accomplishing its mission. While
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has evolved over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, its current mission is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">straightforward</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> exists to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in meeting its
constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance
and accountability of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for the benefit of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX> as a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting</ENAMEX>
Act, a law designed to improve government financial controls and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Wartime</ENAMEX> spending had
increased the national debt, escalated costs for many government
purchases, and created substantial disarray in the financial
operations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">War Department</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
also recognized a need for better financial information and
controls over costs. As a result, the new law required the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> to prepare an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> budget, and it transferred from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s auditing,
accounting, and claims functions.
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s and 1930s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> focused on preaudit payment work
and whether government spending had been handled legally. The bulk
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work centered on the auditing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> vouchers; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> checked vouchers and settled the accounts of executive
branch disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> sent their
vouchers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, which checked the legality, propriety, and
accuracy of expenditures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s workload increased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> as federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money</ENAMEX> poured
into New Deal recovery and relief efforts to combat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Depression</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin D. Roosevelt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, which started out with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, had a workforce
that numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 5,000</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> remained
the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s activities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> first began
doing fieldwork in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid1930s</TIMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> early fieldwork
assignment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> looked at the operation of government agriculture
programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> and several southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
With the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> entry into <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> faced enormous
challenges. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> continued to do the same type of work it had
done before the war but with vastly increased volume. Defense
production soared after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> geared up to
meet the demands of war. Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> expanded, churning out
mountains of expenditure forms for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to examine. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reviewed
defense contracts and audited the accounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disbursing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>. The war effort created a blizzard of
transportation vouchers for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to review as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> used
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s rails and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> to carry freight and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> hired
additional audit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> and freight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX>, nearly tripling the
size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 15,000</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>. The paperwork was so
intense that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> faced a backlog of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35 million</NUMEX> unaudited vouchers
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> and had to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> catching up on work.
Overall, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> handled a staggering backlog of paperwork as a result
of the war: in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reconciled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">490 million</NUMEX> checks and audited
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92,000</NUMEX> accountable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>' accounts, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 million</NUMEX> transportation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vouchers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5 million</NUMEX> contracts, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260 million</NUMEX> postal money
orders.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wartime</ENAMEX> experiences spelled the end of the voucherchecking
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">era</ENAMEX>. The increase in paperwork showed how difficult it was for a
single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to keep up with examining every government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disbursement</ENAMEX>. The war also highlighted a number of accountability
issues. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> repeatedly
pointed to the lack of accountability of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>
and problems with contract fraud. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> applauded the passage in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Corporation Control Act</ENAMEX>, which authorized
the auditing of wholly owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government corporations</ENAMEX> and mixed
ownership <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>. Responding to the requirements of the act,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren</ENAMEX> created a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation Audits Division</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>. He began
hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> to perform <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> audits of government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>.
With passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Budget and Accounting Procedures Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> as a whole shifted to comprehensive auditing of
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Instead of concentrating on individual fiscal
transactions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> began reviewing financial management and internal
controls at government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Responsibility for checking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vouchers</ENAMEX> shifted to the various executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> focused
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prescribing</TIMEX> accounting principles, performing audits on agency
sites, and checking financial controls and procedures.
The move to comprehensive auditing represented a major turning
point for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> returned to its prewar size.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> reduced the number of voucher <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX> in its employ and
began hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> began to emerge in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s and 1960s</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> responded to its new mission by recruiting and training a
broader array of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and working to set standards that
professionalized the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. To keep a watchful eye on spending
at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and abroad, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> formally established a network of field
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1950s</TIMEX> and opened
a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>. The scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work expanded again
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> initiated the Great Society's
War on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Poverty</ENAMEX>. The number of federal grantsinaid rose sharply and
the rapid growth in federally assisted programs placed enormous
administrative control burdens on government at all levels.
Let me note at this point that all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptrollers General</ENAMEX> made
substantial contributions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, and I am particularly pleased to
be here with my immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elmer Staats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
Bowsher- both made enormous contributions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> came
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller General Staats</ENAMEX>, who took office in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>, and was a
driving force behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s emphasis on program evaluation and
making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s work more useful to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
The growth in congressionally based work, combined with the
expansion of government programs, was responsible for a significant
change in the makeup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, mostly
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accountants</ENAMEX>, began to change to fit these new assignments. In the
1970s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> started recruiting social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in such fields as health care, science,
public policy, and information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, most of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> were reclassified as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evaluators</ENAMEX> to reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s varied work. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Staats'</TIMEX> tenure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
relied on new technological tools as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with diverse
academic degrees. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> made
increasing use of computers in its audit and administrative
operations.
Staats was also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in recognizing the importance of
international interaction in the accountability field. He made
major contributions to the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions</ENAMEX> (INTOSAI), which
includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">179</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, and he also created an international
fellows program at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to provide support, training, and guidance
to a cadre of key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from accountability organizations
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eightynine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> have participated in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Auditor Fellowship Program</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">279</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> have
graduated from the program since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>. Indeed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> former fellows
have since become the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors General</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, and many more have served
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies</ENAMEX> or in other highlevel posts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller General Bowsher</ENAMEX> also made major contributions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
and to the improvement of financial management and government
operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowsher</ENAMEX> continued the emphasis on personnel
improvement, strengthening the recruitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with diverse
professional backgrounds and providing them with improved tools and
work incentives. He expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s training curriculum and
strengthened the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Training Institute</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowsher</ENAMEX> also helped to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s growing emphasis on
management reform and performance and accountability issues. During
his tenure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowsher</ENAMEX> paid close attention to budget issues, warned
about the dangers of the increasing deficit, and worked to improve
federal financial management. In part due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed a series of laws designed to
improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>,
including:


•
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> Act-which created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFOs</ENAMEX> in
all major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>;


•
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Performance and Results Act</ENAMEX>-which created
a requirement for measuring and reporting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>'
performance;


•
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</ENAMEX>-which streamlined
government paperwork and reporting requirements;


•
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Management Reform Act</ENAMEX>-which requires the
government to prepare an annual consolidated financial statement
audited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>;


•
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act</ENAMEX>-which is helping
to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> acquisition more efficient and effective;
and


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">theSingleAudit Act</ENAMEX>.


During <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowsher</ENAMEX>'s tenure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first</ENAMEX> began doing general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">management</ENAMEX> reviews, which looked at broad organizational and
management issues at government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> also initiated a
series of highrisk reports, now issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 2 years</TIMEX>, to provide
information on federal activities susceptible to waste, fraud,
abuse, and mismanagement.
When I became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1998</TIMEX>, I committed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> address issues that will define the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21st century</TIMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s Accomplishments
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> conducts a wide range of financial and performance
audits and program evaluations and reviews the business and mission
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work covers everything from the challenges of
an aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the demands of the information age to
emerging national security threats and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of
globalization. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is also committed to management reform-to
helping government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resultsoriented</ENAMEX> and accountable to the public.
Ultimately, we may find that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> needs a new name-the words
"general accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>" do not really capture our more complex
role anymore. It might be more appropriate to consider something
closer to "government accountability <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>." It more clearly
conveys our role and the expectations of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the press, and the public. It might also help us in our
recruiting efforts in the increasingly competitive marketplace.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s core values of accountability, integrity, and reliability
reflect its dedication to good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and professional
standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Accountability</ENAMEX> describes the nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work in
helping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> oversee federal programs and operations to ensure
effective and efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s work reflects integrity because it is professional,
objective, factbased, nonpartisan, nonideological, fair and
balanced. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> strives also for reliability by providing highquality
information that is timely, accurate, useful, clear, and
candid.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> relies on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> of highly trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> who
hold degrees in many academic disciplines, such as accounting, law,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, economics, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> and physical sciences. I am extremely proud of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">workforce</ENAMEX>, of its dedication and excellence, and of its service to
the betterment of government and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my principal
goals for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is that we not only work to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, but
that we also work to improve ourselves. I look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to become a
model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and I am convinced
that, because of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, we will achieve that goal.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, I am also proud of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s accomplishments in
supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and helping improve the performance and
accountability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for the benefit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> made substantial contributions to
help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the executive branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> improve
government programs and services. It provided <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $20 billion</NUMEX>
in direct financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Page 5 GAO/</ENAMEX>TOCG0010
benefits, recommended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 600</NUMEX> actions that have led to
improvements in government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, and provided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229</NUMEX> testimonies
requested by congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>. While many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
contributions cannot be quantified in dollar terms, those that can
be quantified show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> returned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $57</NUMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX>
appropriated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Benefits</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> succeeds in its mission when its findings and
recommendations lead to improvements wherever federal dollars are
spent. The following examples illustrate some of the financial
benefits that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the executive branch
achieve:


•
To help the government better realize the value of its
assets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> suggested ways the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
Energy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOE</ENAMEX>) could increase the profitability of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> sold from the
federally owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Petroleum Reserve</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elk Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> testified before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would see a
greater return from the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elk Hills</ENAMEX> than from retaining
ownership. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s suggestions for changes to the sale process were
adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOE</ENAMEX>, resulting in proceeds of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $1.5 billion</NUMEX> above
the original sale price.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to achieve greater savings from
more efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recently enacted
legislation based in part on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s recommendations to strengthen
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>'s safeguards against fraud and abuse. These improvements
saved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $2.2 billion</NUMEX> over fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years 1998 and 1999</TIMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> recommendations included in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> program legislation will produce a gradual reduction,
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, in the overly generous "adjustment
factor" designed to compensate teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> for higher
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> costs. This legislative change is estimated to produce
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.5 billion</NUMEX> in savings for the program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1999</TIMEX> and

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has made recommendations to streamline the tax system
and help support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in its longterm fiscal decisions.
Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s evaluations, for instance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> changed the
tax laws pertaining to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earned Income Tax Credit</ENAMEX>. Specifically,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> avoided <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $1.3 billion</NUMEX> in payments for
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5year</NUMEX> period ending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX> through changes to the
wealth, capital gains, and passive income tests for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earned</ENAMEX>
Income <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Credit</ENAMEX> eligibility criteria. Similarly, as part of the
Small <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Business Job Protection Act</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> phased out tax
credits to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> for certain income earned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work on this issue contributed to an
estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.3 billion</NUMEX> in financial benefits for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1996</TIMEX>
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> also helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> identify and
reduce unnecessary spending. As part of its ongoing work in housing
issues, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has provided assistance to improve the accuracy of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>) budget and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> estimates. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s method for estimating
funding for its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 8</ENAMEX> housing assistance resulted in requests
that exceeded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s needs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> to
submit revised estimates, after which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1998</TIMEX> budget
was reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $1.3 billion</NUMEX> in light of the streamlined
projections. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> also rescinded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.4 billion</NUMEX>
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1998</TIMEX> supplemental request. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
recommendations helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> avoid additional costs of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $1.1</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>. Based in part on these examples, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
audits and recommendations helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> save an estimated
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.3 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1998 and 1999</TIMEX>.


•
Similarly, as part of its assistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in
reviewing the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> (DOD) budget
request for military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> identified areas where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX> could be reduced. These included excess manpower costs due
to over estimated military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> levels, unnecessary advance
pay, and funds not needed due to gains from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. As a result of




<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health and Safety</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> reduced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year 1999</TIMEX> military
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">personnel</ENAMEX> budget for active and reserve forces by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $609</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> without compromising overall readiness.
In addition to the financial benefits resulting from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s efforts also contribute to numerous qualitative
improvements in government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and services. During fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> contributed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607</NUMEX> such benefits achieved by the
government, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">13percent</NUMEX> increase over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1998</TIMEX>. Benefits
resulting from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s recommendations included better public safety
and consumer protection, more efficient and effective government
operations and services, help in ensuring <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Year 2000 readiness</ENAMEX>, and
improvements to computer security.

Recommendations

Some examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s contributions to improved government
operations follow:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">• GAO</ENAMEX> has assisted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in efforts to
improve public health. For example, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has issued a
series of reports on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> highlighting widespread inadequate
health care quality in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. As part
of its evaluation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> made a series of recommendations to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX> (HCFA) for improvements to its
nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> survey process and for stronger enforcement in
instances when nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> repeatedly violate regulations and do
not correct deficiencies. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> developed a


More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Efficient Government</ENAMEX>
set of initiatives designed to improve patient care and
eliminate deficiencies. Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> now requires
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to investigate serious complaints alleging harm to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX>, has proposed an expansion of its enforcement
programs by subjecting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> with repeated serious deficiencies to
immediate sanctions, and has revised the protocols that state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surveyors</ENAMEX> use to inspect nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to better focus the
reviews.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s reports have also convinced some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to improve their
oversight of nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. In response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s finding that
serious complaints of poor nursing home care frequently are not
investigated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> approved funding
for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 percent</NUMEX> increase in its surveyor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and the state
agency revamped its processes to emphasize a faster review of
serious complaints.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has also made significant contributions to improving
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal justice</ENAMEX>. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has reported on the prevalence
and costs of identity fraud involving the illegal use of another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s identifying information (such as name, date of birth, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> number) to commit financial crimes. Illegal
activities range from the unauthorized use of a credit card to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> takeover of financial accounts. Largely in response
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> enacted legislation that criminalized
the theft and misuse of personal identifying information and
provided legal recognition for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of fraud.


•
Transportation safety is another important area in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has helped to improve government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and the public's
quality of life. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> (FRA) had few regulations involving
passenger car safety for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> or commuter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rail</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. As a
result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> provided little oversight of passenger car
safety. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> recommended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> establish appropriate
criteria for the condition of safety control components on
passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. Addressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s recommendation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FRA</ENAMEX> established
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> structural safety standards for passenger equipment
and created more stringent safety standards for highspeed passenger
rail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>.


•
Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s large entitlement programs are
susceptible to fraud, waste, and mismanagement. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s contribution to improving government performance and
preventing fraud and waste is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Supplemental Security Income</ENAMEX>
(SSI) program-the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s largest cash assistance program for the
poor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reported that the program's financial integrity was
ineffective because the program has overpaid


<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Page 9 GAO/</ENAMEX>TOCG0010
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $3.3 billion</NUMEX>. The magnitude of
overpayments, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Administration</ENAMEX>'s (SSA)
inability to recover outstanding SSI debt, led to the program's
inclusion on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s highrisk list. Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> is
expanding its use of online data to better verify financial
information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> and prevent future overpayments. SSA
is also seeking statutory authority for additional tools to recover
current overpayments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">• GAO</ENAMEX> has played an important role in helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s computer security and make
more effective use of technology in the delivery of federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has been extremely concerned about the
government's ability to prevent intruders from accessing
government's extensive computer and information systems. As a
result, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 80</NUMEX>
reports on data and systems security including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
recommendations for correcting both individual weaknesses and the
systemic causes of security problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work has led to
improvements in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, including the development of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">entitywide</ENAMEX> security management practices. It has also led to
computer security and other information technologyrelated
legislation.
In addition to its reviews of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has
developed techniques and practices that can be applied across the
government. This work has made significant contributions to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' abilities to develop and implement sound security
policies. The information security management practices identified
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s executive guides have been incorporated into policy
guidance at many federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FederalInformationSystemControlsAuditManualis</ENAMEX> now used by most
major federal audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> to evaluate computerrelated
controls.
In discussing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s contributions and accomplishments, it is
important that we engage in a select amount of research and
development work to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> can meet the institutional
needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> over the long term. This investment has made
major contributions to the performance, stability, and
accountability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and the protection of tax dollars.
As I will discuss later in this testimony, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s flexibility to
engage in this important component of our work has been
increasingly constrained by other demands on our resources.
Among the most important work that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has done are reviews
related to the Year <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Y2K</NUMEX>) computing challenge. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work on
Y2K began through its research and development program, but the
vital importance of this issue has manifested itself in many
congressional requests for work that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> received in fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years 1998 and 1999</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> designated Y2K as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">highrisk</ENAMEX> area to highlight the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s exposure. Throughout
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997, 1998</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> worked closely with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on Y2K
issues-including this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittee</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> created the Special
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Year 2000 Technology Problem</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> called on
this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee on Technology</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Science</ENAMEX> to lead its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Y2K</ENAMEX> monitoring. With leadership
from you, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, congressional
committees examined the implications of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y2K</TIMEX> on various government
operations and in key economic sectors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> produced a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> guides to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> confront
the problem. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> also issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 160</NUMEX> reports detailing specific
findings and made over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> recommendations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year 2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Conversion</ENAMEX> for improving the
government's readiness. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> recommended that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year 2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Conversion</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to
develop contingency plans for all critical core business processes.
Accordingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> clarified its
contingency plan instructions and, along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Information</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officers Council</ENAMEX>, adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s business continuity and contingency
planning guide for federal use, thus reducing the risks of
disruption to major programs and services.
Finally, let me note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is proud of its record in
providing timely service to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. As figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> indicates,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has consistently improved its ability to promptly meet
congressional requests. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX>
percent of its products on time.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISCAL YEARS</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, as I am sure you appreciate, the issues
confronting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have grown more
complex in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>. The pace of change has accelerated for
government and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as a whole. The increasing
challenges facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> over the long term have had a
longlasting impact on the nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and on
how it supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Where, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
existence, changes to its roles and responsibilities and to the
demands placed on it occurred more slowly, there is no question
that the environmental changes affecting its mission in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> have been more persistent and have occurred more rapidly. In
fact, the timeline of major events in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s existence (see figure
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) reveals the increasing development, complexity and influence of
difficult public policy issues related to government activity and
our accountability mission:

Likewise, it comes as no surprise that as a result of the
increasing complexity and breadth of issues facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> is availing itself of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s services and support on
an unprecedented and accelerating basis. While <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
work was done as a result of congressional requests in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, it was
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. Overall, congressional requests for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> work
have increased from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>, at the start of the Staats
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">era</ENAMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX>, at the beginning of my term. Part of the reason
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s increased reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> is the
result of our ability to add unique value to the products and
service we provide. With the advent of agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> general
and other similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is no longer the only federal
entity charged with improving the accountability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that can consistently provide
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the executive branch with analysis, options, and
recommendations that are long range, broad, in coverage, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> in the development and presentation of critical
information. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s efforts are multilateral and cognizant of the
international implications of issues ranging from security to the
environment. And they also reflect the nuances of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">federalism</ENAMEX>, ensuring that implications of service delivery and
devolution on state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and on the private and
nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> are factored into all of its work. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>,
there is no question that effective stewardship must consider how
increasingly diverse approaches to public sector responsibilities
are leading to diffuse accountability.
I am convinced that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is now entering another significant era
that will take its place on the timeline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s historic
key events. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has worked hard to make the transition from an
accounting and preaudit environment to become a diversified,
multidisciplinary accountability and professional services
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. As I have discussed, my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX> did a tremendous
amount to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> had the capacity and capabilities to
serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and prepare for the future during their tenure.
And I,atthe startofthe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21st century</TIMEX>, have begun to do the same
thing.
Clearly, much has already changed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has grappled with this
critical transition. As the following graphs show, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> seen considerable changes in its staffing and budget
allocations-levels that, unfortunately, did not generally reflect
its workload and the growing demands placed on it by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
Reductions in its resource levels, combined with increases and
shifts in its workload have in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to take
strong measures to more efficiently accomplish its mission. For
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has taken significant steps to consolidate its field
office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has been able to close field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> both in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and overseas-much of it through attrition-and
achieve gains in productivity and collaborative work environments.
At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s flexibility has been reduced by extensive
changes to the mix of its products-as mentioned, virtually all of
its work is done at the request of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, and an increasing
amount of that stems from mandates.
The following charts highlights the changes I am discussing:

In a nutshell, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> currently stands at an important crossroads
in its history and in its ability to provide the unique support the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> expect from it. Many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activities GAO</ENAMEX> has undertaken are designed to ensure that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> is properly positioned to fully support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> as it
faces the future.
Since I became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX>, one of the most important
activities in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has been engaged is the development of its
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strategic plan for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. This document is a
blueprint for how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> will support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> as it continues to
face complex issues and challenges. Building on global changes that
are impacting society on a variety of levels, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s strategic plan
develops a comprehensive and focused structure of longterm goals
and objectives to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in its legislative,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oversight</ENAMEX>, and investigative roles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> worked closely with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legislative</ENAMEX> and committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and staff
in the development of this strategic plan. Thus, this plan not only
incorporates congressional views about what it believes to be
important and emerging issues, it also establishes a framework for
seeing fundamental constitutional responsibilities in the context
of current challenges and emerging changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has developed a set of strategic goals and objectives that
will help to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in its decisionmaking and improve
the performance and accountability of the executive branch. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
plan presents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> strategic goals that will help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
perform its constitutional responsibilities and ensure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
ability to continue providing effective, quality support to its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.
The due diligence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has expended to develop its strategic
plan in concert with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has identified a number of
complex issues that are not easily solved. These issues are
reflected in the goals and objectives of the plan and will serve as
the guide for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work priorities in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming years</TIMEX>. Many of
these issues will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to resolve satisfactorily, but by
focusing on these issues now, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will be much better
positioned to meet its responsibilities for governing as it begins
to confront these current and emerging challenges.
There is no question that the cold war has ended, and we won. In
addition, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 30 years</TIMEX> of budget deficits, the combination
of hard choices and remarkable economic growth has led to budget
surpluses. As a result, we transition into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this new century</TIMEX> with
different security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> and an improved financial position
relatively free of the deficit constraints of the recent past. In
order to prepare effectively for the future, however, we must fully
explore the major dynamic that will shape the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and its
place in the world and adequately prepare the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to
meet the challenges that lie ahead. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittee</ENAMEX> is uniquely
positioned to consider these broadbased and crosscutting challenges
and what needs to be done to address them.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s strategic plan goals focus on how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> can help
support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in dealing with many complex issues and the
challenges of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. These goals, the strategic objectives,
and the major thematic issues that influence them are as
follows:
Provide Timely, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quality GAO</ENAMEX>'s first strategic goal focuses on
several of the aspirations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> defined by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Founders</ENAMEX>: "toestablishjustice,insure

on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s future.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> To support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in its decisionmaking in this
area, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> will focus significant resources on the following
important strategic objectives:


•
researching possible options to meet the health care
needs of an aging and diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>;


•
examining ways to ensure a secure retirement for older
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>;


•
reviewing the social safety net for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in
need;


•
supporting efforts to provide for an educated citizenry
and a productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>;


•
helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> strengthen a system of justice that
is effective in controlling crime, illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, and illegal
immigration;


•
providing analysis and other support concerning the
effectiveness of investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">communities</ENAMEX> and economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>;


•
researching ways to increase responsible stewardship of
natural resources and the environment; and


•
helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> maintain a safe and efficient
national physical infrastructure.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the important issues that reflect this goal and its
objectives is Demographics. The profound changes forecast in the
age and composition of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will have enormous
consequences for the retirement and health care entitlement
programs as well as programs supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is growing older. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2030</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is projected to be over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65</TIMEX>, compared with about
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. Also by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2030</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX>, who
include the disabled as well as the elderly, are expected to
account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The result will be that
fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> will be paying into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> for every person
receiving benefits. As shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
were paying into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> for every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> receiving
benefits. Today, the ratio is down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4 to 1</NUMEX>, and, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2030</TIMEX>, it is
projected to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2 to 1</NUMEX>.

These trends will have enormous financial repercussions for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">solvency</ENAMEX> and sustainability of federal entitlement programs. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Hospital Trust Fund</ENAMEX> has operated in the red since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> and
is projected to face insolvency in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2025</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
expenditures are expected to exceed payroll tax revenues beginning
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2015</TIMEX>, with trust funds being depleted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2037</TIMEX>.
But crafting a solution to financing these entitlement programs
involves more than the traditional approach of closing the gap
between projected expenditures and revenues over a fixed time
period, such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75 years</TIMEX>. Rather, any financing solution needs to
achieve sustainablesolvency that balances projected expenditures
and revenues without requiring us to frequently revisit the
financing of these programs.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Actuary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Administration</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is also becoming more diverse. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> as a proportion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> have grown
significantly. This trend, along with the increased use of parttime
and other flexible work arrangements, has implications for federal
policies and programs related to education, training, childcare,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immigration</ENAMEX>, and retirement, and other areas. Although the
increased presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> caused substantial
growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX>, this trend seems
to be changing. Projections for the future are that the annual
growth in the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> will be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 1 percent</NUMEX> in the short
term and that this growth rate may even decline over the long term.
These trends further exacerbate the current tight labor market for
specialized skills and key sections of the economy, suggesting the
need for more policies designed to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to retreat
gradually from work rather than plunge into retirement.
Another major concern is Quality of life. It has improved for
many but not for all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. At the same time, prosperity is
placing greater stresses on the quality of life.
The long period of strong economic performance has been
accompanied by economic prosperity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are typically living
longer, with average life expectancy rising to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 76</TIMEX> over the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>, while unemployment has fallen to low levels, and violent
crimes have dropped by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. The quality of the
physical environment has also improved, as levels of major air and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water pollutants</ENAMEX> have dropped since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>.
However, many challenges remain. For example, the disparities
between the net worth of those without a high school education and
those with more education increased <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1989 and 1998</TIMEX>. While
unemployment has reached record or nearrecord lows for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AfricanAmericans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX>, unemployment rates for these two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> still stand at nearly twice the rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>, and more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> lack health insurance. Given the large
federal role in health care delivery and financing, there is a need
to weigh the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> against their wants and the overall
affordability of health care considered by policymakers.
At the same time prosperity is placing greater stresses on
quality of life. Greater economic activity, for example, increases
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX> and highway traffic and heightens concerns about congestion,
safety, and environmental quality. The shift to a more
technologically based economy raises long term concerns about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, while population growth and geographic shifts, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> sprawl, place greater strains on transportation and other
infrastructure. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming years</TIMEX>, these demands for new
investment will increasingly come into competition with other
national priorities, creating difficult choices for the federal
government.

through open markets and technology, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> faces
threats to its national security and

Challenges of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Global</ENAMEX>
Interdependence the challenges of global interdependence.
To support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in its decisionmaking in this area, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
will focus significant resources on the following important
strategic objectives:


•
helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> respond to diffuse threats to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> and global security,


•
providing analysis and other support to ensure military
capabilities and readiness,


•
supporting efforts to advance and protect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
international interests, and


•
reviewing ways to recognize and respond to the impact of
global market forces on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic and security
interests.


Several of the important themes influencing this goal and its
objectives include globalization and national security.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Globalization</ENAMEX>, or the interdependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX>, economies,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, presents new opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>, but also new challenges for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
With rapid advances in technology and the ease with which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX>, and goods can cross borders, the economies and
activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> have become increasingly interdependent. From
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960 through 1997</TIMEX>, world exports increased from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 12 percent</NUMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 24 percent</NUMEX> of world GDP (gross domestic product).
Multinational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> are an important part of the trend
towards globalization. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63 percent</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> exports and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> imports were associated with
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent corporations</ENAMEX> or their foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">affiliates</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has been a principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of an open
world trading system and has benefited greatly. However, open trade
has increased the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of maintaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy.
Interdependence of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and foreign economies is illustrated by foreign investment
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
business, which has increased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $200 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, an
amount <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly three</NUMEX> times that invested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year before</TIMEX>.
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy becomes increasingly linked with the global
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, international trade is growing in importance as a foreign
policy issue. At the same time, significant national security
issues also need to be considered. The effectiveness of regional
and global trade arrangements in achieving their desired outcomes
is being questioned at home and abroad. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> have expressed
concern that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has not been sufficiently aggressive
in monitoring and enforcing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 300</NUMEX> international trade agreements
that cover <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of billions of dollars</NUMEX> in trade and affect
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> jobs, and that some decisions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> could compromise <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sovereignty.
Recent financial crises in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> highlight the
implications of the interdependence of economies and financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. For example, the emergence of financial difficulties in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> was followed by financial crises in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, and eventually <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>. Fear that these crises
could severely affect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic and security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> have (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
focused attention on the interdependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and global
economies and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) raised questions about what can be done to
prevent or contain the spread of such crises. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> is a key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
cooperates with to maintain global economic stability. Prompted by
financial crises and government corruption in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>,
questions have been raised regarding their effectiveness and roles
in maintaining the health of the global finance and trade systems
and resolving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>' financial crises.
Economic and financial interdependence are not the only global
trends with implications for this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Increased globalization
of information technology has resulted in significant new security
and privacy threats to our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s information network. Similarly,
the spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> around the world, like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, and the global
nature of environmental problems affect us and also call for a
coordinated international response. Thus, in the future, federal
responses to problems will increasingly have to consider
international as well as national dimensions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> reflect new, diverse, and diffuse
threats of national, economic, and personal dimensions. Less
restricted trade, expanding democracy and capitalism, and rapidly
developing technology have broadened security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> and changed
the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> prepares for conflict. In addition to
more conventional military threats, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is
confronting threats from terrorism; the proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX> destruction; information warfare; the international drug
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>; and other more diffuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, which are harder to
identify, respond to, and contain. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> shows the countries
that possess <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction posing national security
concerns to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>.
The bombings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> have elevated concerns about the spread of terrorism to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 40</NUMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and bureaus
spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $10 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> to combat terrorism.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> armed forces has been reviewed a number of
times since the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>, resulting in substantial
reductions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has expressed concern that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that
remain may not be sufficient to implement the national military
strategy and may not be sufficiently prepared to respond to the
threats of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> begin the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sustained increase in defense
spending in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX>, calling for additional resources totaling
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$112 billion</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 6 years</TIMEX>. In particular, defending the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> against an intercontinental ballistic missile attack
from a rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> and protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and allied deployed forces
from theater missile attacks is receiving considerable attention.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, activities leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s deployment
decision on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Missile Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> are moving ahead and
improvements to key theater missile defense systems, such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater High Altitude Area Defense</ENAMEX> system, are being instituted.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> has proposed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $24 billion</NUMEX> in total funding of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> and theater missile defense from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001 through 2005</TIMEX>.
Should disruptions occur, increasing reliance on complex
interconnected computer systems essential to public wellbeing and
the economy has created serious new vulnerabilities. Protection of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX>, energy, emergency services, financial services, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> systems is becoming increasingly important because
they rely heavily on information technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Criminals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>,
and others, working anonymously from remote locations and with
relatively limited resources, can now use computers to severely
disrupt this infrastructure. An example of disruptions that could
occur is provided by recent denialofservice attacks on popular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">websites</ENAMEX>.
Support the Transition to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> are increasingly
demanding improved government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> and better stewardship of
public resources. The federal


More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ResultsOriented</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountable Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is adopting the principles of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">performancebased</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in an effort to address these demands.
This approach to managing
Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> systematically integrates thinking about
organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>; program and service delivery strategies;
and the use of technology, reliable financial information, and
effective human capital practices into government decisions. Many
initiatives now under way across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to improve operations
and strengthen accountability are being driven by management
reforms statutorily established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
The reforms that have been adopted so far have profound
implications for what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> does, how it is organized, and how
it performs its services to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>.
Consequently, government decisionmakers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are adopting
new ways of thinking, considering different ways of achieving
goals, and using new information to guide decisions. At the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, with budget surpluses now projected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming years</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> faces a new set of challenges, in both the near and
long terms, in making budget decisions.
To support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in its decisionmaking in this area, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
will focus significant resources on the following important
strategic objectives:


•
analyzing the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s longterm and nearterm
fiscal position, outlook, and options;


•
examining ways to strengthen approaches for financing the
government and determining accountability for the use of taxpayer
dollars;


•
facilitating governmentwide management and institutional
reforms needed to build and sustain highperforming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
and more effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>; and


•
recommending economy, efficiency, and effectiveness
improvements in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> programs.


A number of important issues influence this goal and its
objectives. They include a stable federal budgetary future,
technological innovation, and improvements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and
service provision of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
Future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> Issues. Our federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has gone from
budget deficit to surplus as a result of a burgeoning economy and
difficult decisions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the executive branch to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> spending. Compared to the deficits of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s surplus represents a historic turnaround, and current
projections show surpluses continuing over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10year</TIMEX> budget
window, as figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> illustrates.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. Relative to federal spending subject to annual
appropriations-defense and nondefense discretionary spending-the
share devoted to federal health programs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
payments has grown steadily over time. Correspondingly, the share
available for all other programs, including defense, has decreased,
as shown in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>.

Our longterm projections illustrate the consequences for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX> budget, assuming that these trends continue. While we may
enjoy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> surpluses for some time, longterm projections show a
resumption of a pattern of deficits emerging after the anticipated
demographic tidal wave hits. Because of this coming demographic
shift, to move into the future without making changes to federal
retirement and health programs- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>-is to envision a very different role for the federal
government. Even assuming, for example, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> adhere to the oftenstated goal of saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
Security surpluses, our longterm model shows a world by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2030</TIMEX> in
which these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs alone would require almost threequarters
of total federal revenue. Budgetary flexibility would be
drastically constrained, and little room would be left for such
spending on programs for national defense, the young,
infrastructure, and law enforcement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> will increasingly need to distinguish between wants,
needs, and affordability of programs and services in the coming
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> shows spending as a share of GDP under the

In addition there are other looming fiscal pressures, such
as:


•
cleanup costs from federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> that yield
hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>, including defense <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and weapon
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>;


•
future claims on federal insurance programs by an
increasing number of retired federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and military
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>; and


•
demands for new investment to modernize physical
infrastructure, public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, transportation systems, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sewage</ENAMEX> and water treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that are beginning to deteriorate
or become obsolete.


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s surplus represents both opportunity and obligation.
While the new surplus projections offer an opportunity to address
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s needs, we should not forget our stewardship responsibility
to reduce the debt burden and increase the choices we leave to
future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, to provide a strong foundation for future
economic growth and to ensure that future commitments are both
adequate and affordable. Continued debt reduction and entitlement
reforms are both critical to promoting a more sustainable budget
and economy for the long term. In the nearand mediumterm, surpluses
will depend on continued economic growth and fiscal restraint.
Technological innovation, especially in information technology,
has enhanced productivity, but also created new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vulnerabilities</ENAMEX>.
Information technology has transformed the ways we communicate,
learn, use information, conduct commerce, practice health care, and
build and design products. This trend is expected to accelerate,
with investment in information technology expected to account for
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of all capital investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly 172 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around the world will have Internet
access in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> and that number is expected to
double. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Businesses</ENAMEX> that produce computers, software,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">semiconductors</ENAMEX>, and communications equipment have accounted for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a third</NUMEX> of the growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.
Government too is being affected, with information technology
providing new, more responsive and efficient ways of delivering
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> and information to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, in such areas as tax
administration, higher education, transportation safety, and
environmental protection.

The connectivity and interdependence created through information
technology also creates vulnerabilities. Computer security risks
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the widespread use of information create the
potential for disruptions to federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and the private
sector in aviation, banking, law enforcement, emergency services,
and other critical services. The privacy and confidentiality of
medical records, credit histories, and other personal data on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> stored in electronic databases are also at
potential risk. Unless appropriately controlled, computerized
operations can offer those with criminal or other malicious
intentions numerous opportunities for committing fraud, tampering
with data, or disrupting vital operations.
Faced with public demand for more economical, efficient, and
effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> around the world are undertaking
major reform initiatives to improve government performance and
accountability. These reform efforts being undertaken in major
democracies are taking a generally consistent direction, requiring
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to focus more on results and less on
process.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> are increasingly
demanding improved government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> and better stewardship of
public resources. In an effort to meet these demands, the federal
government is adopting the principles of performancebased
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, legislation enacted in the 1990s
has provided a statutory framework that includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
Performance and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Results Act of 1993</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1990</ENAMEX> and related financial management legislation, and
information technology reform legislation, including the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ClingerCohen Act of 1996</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
The impetus for government reform came in part as a reaction to
poor performance, continuing disclosures of waste, and chronic
budget deficits. However, the fact that the federal budget has
turned the corner from deficit to surplus does not reduce the
importance of effective and efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>-nor does it reduce
the importance of fiscal discipline. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> of focusing on
deficit reduction, we know there are pentup demands for using the
projected budget surpluses. The challenge for policymakers will be
to meet public expectations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> while maintaining the
financial discipline necessary to avoid a return to deficits.
Again, there is also the obligation for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> to distinguish
between needs, wants and affordability.
The effective implementation of the statutory framework to
improve the performance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and accountability of the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, although important, is not an end in itself.
Rather, the implementation of the framework is the means to an
end-improved federal performance through enhanced executive branch
and congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decisionmaking</ENAMEX> and oversight. Performance
improvements occur only when congressional and executive branch
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisionmakers</ENAMEX> use information resulting from these reforms to help
inform decisions and improve the performance and accountability of
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s human capital management has emerged as the
missing link in the statutory and management framework that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the executive branch have established to provide for a
resultsoriented federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> should be viewed not as costs to be cut, but
as assets to be valued. Only when the right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are on board
and provided the training, technology, structure, incentives, and
accountability to work effectively is organizational success
possible. Modern human capital management principles recognize that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are a critical asset for success, and that an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s human capital policies and practices must be
designed, implemented, and assessed by the standard of how well
they support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s mission and goals.
As with the private sector, there have been-and will be-many
changes in the demographics of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>, the education
and skills required of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, and basic employment structures
and work arrangements used to accomplish jobs. The federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">workforce</ENAMEX> is aging: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby boomers</ENAMEX>, with their valuable skills
and experience, are drawing near to retirement; new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
joining the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> have different employment
options and different career expectations than the generation that
preceded them. In response to an increasingly competitive job
market, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> will need the tools and flexibility to
attract, hire, retain, and reward topflight talent. More and more,
the work that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> do requires a knowledgebased
workforce that is sophisticated in new technologies, flexible, and
open to continuous learning. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX>' employment structures and
working arrangements will also be changing, and the workplace will
need to accommodate greater flexibility and uncertainty.
The implications of the downsizing of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past decade</TIMEX> are also significant. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1990</TIMEX> through
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>, the number of nonpostal civilian federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> fell from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 2.3 million</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 1.9 million</NUMEX>.
Moreover, new permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hires</ENAMEX> fell from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 118,000</NUMEX> in fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1990</TIMEX> to a low of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 48,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, before beginning a slow
rise to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 71,500</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1998</TIMEX>.
In cutting back on hiring of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in order to reduce the
number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> also reduced the influx of new people
with the new competencies needed to sustain excellence. Also, our
reviews have found, for example, that a lack of adequate strategic
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> planning during the initial rounds of downsizing by
some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> affected their ability to achieve organizational
missions. We intend to do more work on the implications of
downsizing and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s human capital approach
generally. Nevertheless, our view <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is that the widespread lack
of attention to strategic human capital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> may be creating
a fundamental weakness in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, possibly even putting
at risk the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s ability to efficiently,
economically, and effectively deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> and service to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> in the future.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology</ENAMEX>, if leveraged properly, can be an
effective tool for highquality, costeffective government services.
Information technology effectively integrated into strategic plans
and performance management practices can lead to increased customer
satisfaction, government productivity gains, and significant cost
reductions- increasingly important attributes to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> with
a declining employee base.
Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> depends heavily on computer systems and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> to implement vital public services supporting national
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX>, revenue collections, and social benefits. The global
expansion of information technology has resulted in significant new
information security and privacy threats to our information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and technology infrastructure.
Such risks are of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> at the federal level.
Recent audit reports issued by us and by agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> general
show that most of the largest federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have significant
computer security weaknesses. These weaknesses place critical
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, such as national defense, tax collection, law
enforcement, air traffic control, and benefit payments, at
significant risk of disruption as well as fraud and inappropriate
disclosures. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1997</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1999</TIMEX>, our
reports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> designated information security as a
governmentwide highrisk area.
At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> does not always effectively
plan, procure, and implement major technology investments. For
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have struggled with delivering promised
system capabilities on time and within budget. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> spent more than
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX> on systems
modernization without producing commensurate value. Accordingly,
our work over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> has focused on strengthening federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of IT investment. We continue to ask whether
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are spending their technology dollars on the right things
(i.e., investments that return business value in excess of costs)
and whether they are investing in technology the right way (i.e.,
employing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and engineering practices that are disciplined
and effective). In particular, we developed guidance<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX> based on
best practices in the public and private sectors. We have also made
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of recommendations to improve management of largescale IT
investments in many major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.

developing efficient and responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes,
and


•
building an integrated and reliable information
technology infrastructure.


As mentioned throughout this testimony, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is utilizing its
strategic plan to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the executive branch, and
itself confront the many current and emerging complex issues facing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The plan provides an opportunity to
constructively manage a difficult process of change and uncertainty
regarding critical national and international issues, now and in
the future.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is also utilizing the strategic plan to
manage our own transition. The plan not only represents a road map
of how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> will support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in handling issues faced by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, but it also charts the approach we will use to guide
our efforts to strengthen that support and to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has
the capacity to serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> effectively in the st
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.
Likewise, to accomplish the objectives for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s internal
improvements will take the dedication and persistence of all of our
talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
As you know, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, I am personally committed to the
successful implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>. I have seen in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and
private sector careers how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>'s purposes of improved performance
and accountability can be achieved through the disciplined
application of the goalsetting, planning, performance measurement,
and reporting requirements of the act. That's why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s strategic
plan and associated annual performance plan are consistent with the
requirements and best practices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>. We seek, through our
strategic and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> planning process, to "lead by example" by
being a model for implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>. We are not required to
comply with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX>, but we believe that its requirements make good
business sense.
As another example of our decision to voluntarily comply with
congressionally created management reforms and to "lead by
example," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> its firstever accountability report.
This report discussed how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work benefited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AccountabilityReportis</ENAMEX> different from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
previous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> reports. It reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s accomplishments
in meeting its mission consistent with applicable professional
standards and our core values of accountability, integrity, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX>. The report also included our financial statements and
an unqualified opinion from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realignment</ENAMEX>. In order to better support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and
maximize the value of our strategic plan, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> I announced a
realignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. This realignment, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 15</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, will be implemented beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>, although the
planning and transition activities have already begun. As I've
discussed in my testimony, the increasing complexity of issues and
the accelerating change in government-major factors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
strategic plan-helped us realize that this realignment was
necessary to better position <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> for serving the future needs of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Our goal is to better serve our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> by making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
more responsive, more flexible - and more focused on our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> must become more capable of handling multiple responsibilities
in a rapidly changing environment-all while adhering to our core
values and applicable professional standards. We recognize that the
government of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> must be leaner, that it must eliminate
bureaucracy and multiple management layers, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> must
respect future fiscal and budgetary realities, and that they must
be performancedriven and resultsoriented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">realignment</ENAMEX> is part of our effort to lead the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> by
example-we are certain that this realignment will eliminate
management layers, reduce silos, and improve coordination,
productivity, and teambuilding throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
The realignment will ensure a continued ability to provide
timely, quality work; will build on efforts to provide broad
oversight support; will enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> communications and feedback;
and will maintain a highlevel of return on investment. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">realignment</ENAMEX> also gives us a great opportunity to comprehensively
focus on how to make our processes work better to serve our staff
and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, and how we can broaden and retool our products to
make them as useful as possible to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> ahead.
Moreover, the realignment will help us to enhance our longterm
capacity by improving recruitment and retention; building a
succession plan; focusing on emerging issues; and leveraging
technology opportunities for improvements to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, processes,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
The realignment reduces the number of issue areas from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> to
11.2 It eliminates the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and strengthens
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teambased matrix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. We are creating a riskbased management
approach that will reduce the number and sequential nature of our
product reviews. We will increase empowerment and accountability at
the senior executive level. We also will leverage new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to
focus on external issues important to our many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, and on
methodological issues, and strategic studies. And we will create
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> pools of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalists</ENAMEX> to increase our flexibility and
enhance development.
At the same time, we have taken a number of other important
steps to improveGAO to betterserve theCongress. We'vecreated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amoreeffective Engagement Acceptance and Review</ENAMEX> Meeting process to
help senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> direct and oversee work assignments. We've
developed an employee feedback system and facilitated an active
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> suggestion program that has achieved bottomline benefits,
and we have established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller General Employee Advisory</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>, with which I will meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every quarter</TIMEX> to discuss current
and emerging issues of mutual interest and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. And, as I
mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, we are continuing to consolidate and reduce our
field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> to streamline our operations, reduce silos, and
improve productivity. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this year</TIMEX>, I announced that we would
be reducing our field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 to 11</TIMEX> effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Capital</ENAMEX>. As part of the realignment efforts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> needs to
invest more heavily in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Targeted investments need to be
made in our
2GAO's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acquisition</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sourcing Management</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Workforce and Income Security; Finance and Assurance</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Markets and Community Investments; Health Care</ENAMEX>;

Strategy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Readiness; Natural Resources</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment; Physical</ENAMEX>
Infrastructure; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Administration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>.
training, performance rewards and incentives, and performance
appraisal systems. We have begun efforts to strengthen and redesign
our performance appraisal system to better assess employee
strengths and weaknesses, identify training needs, reward and
recognize exceptional performance, and improve performance at all
levels. We have a goal of implementing a new performance appraisal
system for our evaluators beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, but no
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later than fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>.
Efforts also are underway to develop a skills and knowledge
inventory system that will be used to identify skill gaps and
training and succession planning needs, both at an institutional
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> level, and to staff assignments more effectively. We
will continue to correct skill gaps and increase staff productivity
and effectiveness through training. To maximize this investment, we
are reviewing and updating our training curriculum to address the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organizational</ENAMEX>, behavioral, and technical needs of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s overall human capital situation also is of growing
concern. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> faces many of the same difficult personnel issues the
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> is now confronting. Our current human capital
profile has succession planning, structural, and skills imbalance
problems that we need to address if we are to maintain and build
our capacity to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and achieve the goals of our
strategic plan in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 34 percent</NUMEX>
of our evaluator and related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> will be eligible to retire by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of fiscal year 2004</TIMEX>. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 55 percent</NUMEX> of our
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 percent</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> evaluators will
become eligible to retire by that time. Other critical positions,
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>, criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, and mission support, are
also vulnerable.

Another human capital issue is more structural in terms of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staffing</ENAMEX>. As illustrated in the following graphics, we are sparse
at the entrylevel-a result of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5year</NUMEX> hiring freeze we began in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>-and rather bulky in the middle. We have been more fortunate
than many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, in that our attrition rate is extremely low. We
believe this low rate reflects the quality and dedication of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> as well as the strength of our recent human capital
management improvements. Cultural transitions of major
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> are never easy to accomplish, and I would certainly
not claim that it will be easy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. Still, through a
combination of employee communications and outreach efforts, most
of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> recognize that change is not only good for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> at this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, it is imperative for the future.

Fiscal Years
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s significant human capital imbalances and risks stem from
dramatic budgetary cuts, downsizing, hiring freezes, and other
related actions from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992 through1997</TIMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
underwent budgetary cuts totaling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 percent</NUMEX> in constant fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1992</TIMEX> dollars. In order to achieve these budgetary reductions,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was reduced by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 percent</NUMEX>. These actions have had a
considerable impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s human capital structure. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s human capital profile as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1989</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">FY 1989 FY 2000</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has turned to contracted resources to achieve its mission
and missionsupport requirements. Contract funding in inflation
adjusted dollars has increased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13.1 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$29.2</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
Clearly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> needs assistance to meet its looming human capital
challenges. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has made considerable progress in
confronting its problems, but more needs to be done. In order to
effect the realignment, strengthen our human capital profile, and
position <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to fulfill its strategic plan and support the future
needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has requested legislation from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to


•
give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> the flexibility to appoint scientific,
technical, or professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to seniorlevel positions with the
same pay, rights, and other attributes as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior</ENAMEX>
Executive Service;


•
authorize voluntary early retirement for selected
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> for the purpose of realigning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>;


•
authorize separation payments for realignment purposes;
and


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authorize the Comptroller General</ENAMEX> to release <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIFs</ENAMEX> which are carried out for purposes of downsizing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">realignment</ENAMEX> or correcting skills imbalances.


This legislation would be a supplement to administrative actions
that we have taken and will be taking in the near future, and it is
based on a sound business case focused on enabling us to better
support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in the future. The legislation would be used to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">realign GAO</ENAMEX>, not to downsize it, and would only be for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-the
legislation would have no effect on the executive branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
It also would provide relief from applying certain reductioninforce
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIF</ENAMEX>) provisions that could result in an even more unbalanced
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> than exists <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and a consequent detrimental impact on
our ability to serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIFs</ENAMEX> would be used only as a
last resort. I want to stress that our proposal would maintain the
statutory preference for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> and that we have no intention of
deemphasizing our attempts to attain and maintain a highquality and
diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. Also, to provide us greater ability to attract
and retain technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX>, the legislation would provide
authority comparable to that of the executive branch to compensate
selected scientific and technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at seniorexecutive pay
levels. We would use such authority, if granted, sparingly to
address specific targeted needs, such as information technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> and actuaries.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Client Focus</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> continues to turn to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> for
assistance on significant issues facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>-in fact, we face
record demands for our services. As illustrated in the following
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graphic</ENAMEX>, congressional requests and mandates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> services have
increased in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>. From a longterm historical viewpoint,
requests for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> have never been higher, and we
anticipate that this historic growth will continue as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
grapples with increasingly complex and contentious issues requiring
greater contextual sophistication. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, perhaps more than any other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, is positioned through its broadbased skills,
knowledge, and expertise to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in meeting
responsibilities that will only become more difficult as the 21st
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> evolves. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> shows congressional requests as a

Fiscal Year
Mandates
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee/Member</ENAMEX>
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>, we were called upon to testify 229
times before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittees</ENAMEX> as shown
in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 below</NUMEX>. Examples of important testimonies that helped
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in its oversight include our performance
accountability and highrisk series, which depict the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s
major management challenges and program risks; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
reform proposals; financial and operational aspects of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anthrax vaccination</ENAMEX> program, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> reform.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has recently strengthened its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> outreach program to
assist both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in understanding how best to meet
congressional needs. We plan to meet regularly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee Chairs and Ranking</ENAMEX> Minority
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of our appropriations and oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>
to obtain feedback on our performance and to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> work plans
in the context of the strategic plan. Our realignment is a critical
component in improving our communications and outreach with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and ensuring that we continue to maintain and foster ways
to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> meet its responsibilities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has expanded its electronic link to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, and we are now
providing a list of active assignments. We plan to provide other
products and information through this link in the future. Through
consultation with key congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, we
also have developed a set of clearly defined, well documented, and
transparent protocols, intended to be consistently applied in
setting priorities, allocating resources, recognizing existing
commitments, and serving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. These protocols will help
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to better serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and improve customer satisfaction,
to close "expectation gaps" between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> wherever
they exist, to ensure equitable treatment of all requesters
consistent with the protocols, and to maintain and strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
performance and accountability. We began implementing these
protocols in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January of this year</TIMEX> and will test them until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. We will finalize them by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is also interested in fostering constructive engagement with
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch stakeholders</ENAMEX> and enhancing the partnership between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> by strengthening oversight in order to improve
the performance and accountability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. For instance, it
is important to work closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>-while maintaining our
independence-and to utilize our skills, knowledge, and experience
in working cooperatively to improve government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. For
example, we have successfully worked with a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> on
Y2K and with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> to face management problems and improve government
operations. I am convinced there are additional opportunities for
developing constructive engagements while maintaining the integrity
of our principal mission as an accountability <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
Moreover, the pervasive changes confronting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the
nation present an opportunity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to reconsider the
approach it takes to oversight responsibilities. Persistent
attention, new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of performance, and different oversight
structures and processes may be necessary to achieve this
objective.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is uniquely positioned to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> examine what
government does and how government does business-by attacking known
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement; reassessing how
government provides services; improving the performance and
accountability of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>; and preparing for the
government's longterm challenges. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> can provide support to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for holding oversight hearings on major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and
programs on an annual basis. Based on its insight and knowledge of
government accountability, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> can provide effectively packaged
information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and programs from a variety of audit and
program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to support the oversight work of congressional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX>, including the information resulting from the management
reforms in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO resources</ENAMEX> can also be leveraged through
the strategic plan, support of task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and other congressional
oversight approaches, increased communication with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, and
the selective use of detailees.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> also seeks to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in
the strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and security of effective technology
utilization. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, we have made important strides in-and
realized efficiencies by-introducing technology into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. Most recently, we have successfully managed the Y2K
transition. However, we need to maintain and enhance our ability to
take greater advantage of modern technology and achieve an
integrated infrastructure that supports our client service,
strategic planning, human capital, and business process goals and
objectives. To this end we are:


•
developing a longterm comprehensive plan for an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> information technology approach;


•
developing and implementing a shortterm, costeffective
approach to quickly begin to satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s information
needs;


•
establishing performance and cost metrics addressing the
quality and value of information technology services;


•
ensuring the availability of required information
technology skills,


•
replacing obsolete hardware and software agencywide to
help ensure the efficiency and effectiveness in our operations and
enhance our productivity, and


•
stabilizing and improving the responsiveness of our
network.


It is clear that additional investments will be necessary in the
coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to increase our enabling technology and knowledge
management efforts to meet the challenges of the future and
effectively support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.





<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Initiatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Challenges</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to continue maintaining the strength of
its mission, we are committed to find new ways to streamline our
operations while building on our responsiveness and flexibility. I
am convinced that the Strategic Plan we have articulated with the
support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will provide a strong framework for
improving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s challenges in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ahead</TIMEX>.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to achieve its mission and effectively support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
in the future, it will be important for us to have the support of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. As I have mentioned, demand for our work is
essentially at an all time high, especially with regard to mandates
and requests from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. This change in the composition of our
work has left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> less flexibility to pursue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> work-a
component of our services to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that we believe is vital to
ensuring that we can help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recognize important and emerging
issues before they reach a crisis stage. Clearly, that was the case
with our work in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y2K</NUMEX> area and I have no doubt that there are
similar issues out there that we must be sure to identify and
examine before they become major problems. But this becomes harder
and harder for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to do as the demands for our work
increase-requests and mandates already represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> of our
total workload.
It is also extremely important that we maintain and strengthen
our capacity to effectively serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and meet the growing
demand level in the future. This will require a more stable
budgetary and personnel environment than has been the case
historically. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> clearly reflects a resource environment
that has changed dramatically in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>:

In an era of shrinking government capacity but expanding
demands, vigorous congressional oversight and growing requests
requires a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. It will certainly require a more stable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>,
in which budget and personnel levels remain consistent from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> and reflect a work plan built from the strategic plan. A
stable funding level not only supports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s strong return on
investment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$57</NUMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX> spent, it creates the environment
necessary to recruit, retain, compensate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> and motivate a
strong and capable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. It is increasingly clear that the
continued decline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will also
necessitate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> retain sufficient resources to ensure
effective partnering with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> as well as an institutional
memory about government programs and operations.
Without the broadbased assistance and experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to
support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would clearly lose opportunities
for obtaining an array of options, undertaking informed
decisionmaking, and fully pursuing oversight-all important elements
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' constitutional responsibilities. Without stable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funding</ENAMEX> and personnel levels, it will be extremely difficult for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> engage in the types of partnering so critical to the future
oversight work needed to strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s performance and
accountability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> would also have difficulty in taking on some of
the expanded roles that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has asked of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, such as assisting on task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and commissions without any
commensurate adjustment for resources. As I've discussed in this
testimony, without some immediate stability, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> faces many of the
same problems as other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in being able to
effectively deliver services now and in the future. Right now,
considerable differences still exist with respect to our
appropriations levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>-stable funding
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> is still not assured.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> needs funding to support the realignment so critical to our
growing mission. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has requested funding to improve compensation
comparability with the executive branch, strengthen performance
reward and recognition programs, reengineer our performance
appraisal system, and increase our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> productivity through
training and development as well as new information technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>.
At the same time, flexibility may be just as important as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. The human capital legislation is one example. Another
example is the mandates issue. Its is becoming difficult to do
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> work, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Y2K</ENAMEX>, as I mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
ability to pursue research and development issues, many other
consequential issues could go unrecognized and ultimately create
fundamental and serious problems for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. We must have a reasonable amount of flexibility to address
emerging challenges before they reach crisis proportions. Thus, I
would urge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to not lose sight of the important balance
between mandates, requests, and research and development in the mix
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s work supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
In addition to the legislative support I've already discussed,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> will be assessing whether it may need additional authority from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to obtain certain types of records for conducting our
work. As the budgets, functions, and points of service of many
government programs devolve to state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, private
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX> and nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and other <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, it
may become harder for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to obtain the records it needs to
complete audits and evaluations. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to effectively do its job
and obtain all the facts, we must have unfettered access to records
no matter where the federal dollar goes and services are
delivered.
As I've stressed, we are making major changes in how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> will
face the future, both to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and to lead the
government in strategic planning, human capital management,
information technology, and other areas. That is why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s human
capital legislation is so important. The legislation is absolutely
critical to an evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> that is realigning toward a 21st
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century Strategic Plan</ENAMEX> and more modern human capital approaches to
meet its mission.
Moreover, it will important for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to consider issues that
will help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to recruit, retain and motivate an effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>. Clearly, it is important for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to continue to attract
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bright</ENAMEX>, able <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, which is increasingly difficult given the
excellent economy and private sector competition. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-and for
most of the federal government-to compete with the private sector,
we must be able to have a more flexible compensation system that
can bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> employment at attractive pay
levels. This makes it incumbent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to create
incentives to recruit new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and retain older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> should consider establishing incentives such as debt
relief for school loans for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hires</ENAMEX>, an ability for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> that is
eligible to retire to retreat slowly into retirement through part
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> work, while obtaining a portion of their pension, and a
provision that allows federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>- like private sector
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>-to keep frequent flier miles. Many commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of the physical impact and disruption of family life
that results from frequent travel, allow their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to keep
frequent flyer awards. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has always considered
frequent flyer awards to be property of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, and sought
to reduce travel costs by requiring their use only for official
travel. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six years ago</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> enacted this requirement into
law, and required the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration</ENAMEX> to promote
the use of frequent flyer programs. It is time to examine whether
the financial benefits of trying to make use of frequent flyer
benefits would be outweighed by the recruiting and retention
benefits of allowing personal use of those benefits.
Finally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area I believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> needs to begin thinking
about is the process for appointment of the Deputy Comptroller
General. The current process was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>. The governing
statute provides that a committee consisting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pro Tempore</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority</ENAMEX> and Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairmen</ENAMEX> and
Ranking Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Governmental Affairs</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Government Reform Committees</ENAMEX> recommend an individual to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> for appointment. This process has never worked and it is
too complicated. There has been no Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> since
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Keller</ENAMEX> passed away over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades ago</TIMEX>. There are a number of
possible alternatives to the current process that would avoid
conflicts between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. For example,
I could appoint a deputy with the approval of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a panel consisting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ranking</ENAMEX> Minority
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of our oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of the
Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget Office</ENAMEX> appoints his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, whose term is tied
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>'s just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Comptroller General</ENAMEX>'s term is
tied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller General's</ENAMEX>. Let me also note that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene L.</ENAMEX>
Dodaro, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Operating Officer</ENAMEX>, would make a terrific Deputy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be
pleased to respond to any questions that you or the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have.
