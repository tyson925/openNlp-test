Standards for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX>


Foreword
Federal policymakers and program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are continually
seeking ways to better achieve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and program
results, in other words, they are seeking ways to improve
accountability. A key factor in helping achieve such outcomes and
minimize operational problems is to implement appropriate internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. Effective internal control also helps in managing change
to cope with shifting environments and evolving demands and
priorities. As programs change and as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> strive to improve
operational processes and implement new technological developments,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> must continually assess and evaluate its internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> to assure that the control activities being used are
effective and updated when necessary.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Managers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Financial Integrity Act of 1982</ENAMEX> (FMFIA)
requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>) to issue standards for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The standards provide the overall
framework for establishing and maintaining internal control and for
identifying and addressing major performance and management
challenges and areas at greatest risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and
mismanagement. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) Circular
A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Accountability</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>, revised
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 21, 1995</TIMEX>, provides the specific requirements for assessing
and reporting on controls. The term internal control in this
document is synonymous with the term management control (as used in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-123</ENAMEX>) that covers all aspects of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
operations (programmatic, financial, and compliance).
Recently, other laws have prompted renewed focus on internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Performance and Results Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>
requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to clarify their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX>, set strategic and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> performance goals, and measure and report on performance

Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)
toward those goals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control plays a significant role in
helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> achieve those goals. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officers</ENAMEX> Act of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> calls for financial management systems to
comply with internal control standards, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial</ENAMEX>
Management <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Improvement Act of 1996</ENAMEX> identifies internal control as
an integral part of improving financial management systems.
Rapid advances in information technology have highlighted the
need for updated internal control guidance related to modern
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of human capital has gained
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> as a significant part of internal control. Furthermore,
the private sector has updated its internal control guidance with
the issuance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control - Integrated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX>, published
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sponsoring Organizations</ENAMEX> of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Consequently, we have developed this standards
update which supersedes our previously issued "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Controls</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>."
This update gives greater recognition to the increasing use of
information technology to carry out critical government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>,
recognizes the importance of human capital, and incorporates, as
appropriate, the relevant updated internal control guidance
developed in the private sector. The standards are effective
beginning with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Managers Financial</ENAMEX>
Integrity Act reports covering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>.
We appreciate the efforts of government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, public
accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> and academia who provided valuable assistance in
developing these standards.

Introduction

Definition and Objectives
The following definition, objectives, and fundamental concepts
provide the foundation for the internal control standards.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control is a major part of managing an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. It
comprises the plans, methods, and procedures used to meet missions,
goals, and objectives and, in doing so, supports performance-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control also serves as the first line of
defense in safeguarding assets and preventing and detecting errors
and fraud. In short, internal control, which is synonymous with
management control, helps government program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> achieve
desired results through effective stewardship of public
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control should provide reasonable assurance that the
objectives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> are being achieved in the following
categories:


•
Effectiveness and efficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> including the
use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s resources.


•
Reliability of financial reporting, including reports on
budget execution, financial statements, and other reports for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> and external use.


•
Compliance with applicable laws and
regulations.


A subset of these objectives is the safeguarding of assets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control should be designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention of or prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s assets.


Fundamental Concepts

The fundamental concepts provide the underlying framework for
designing and applying the standards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Control Is a Continuous Built-in Component of</ENAMEX>
Operations
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control is not one event, but a series of actions and
activities that occur throughout an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s operations and on an
ongoing basis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control should be recognized as an integral
part of each system that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> uses to regulate and guide its
operations rather than as a separate system within an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. In
this sense, internal control is management control that is built
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> as a
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control Is Effected</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
part of its infrastructure to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and
achieve their aims on an ongoing basis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are what make internal control work. The responsibility
for good internal control rests with all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> sets
the objectives, puts the control mechanisms and activities in
place, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitors</ENAMEX> and evaluates the control. However, all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> play important roles in making it
happen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control Provides Reasonable Assurance</ENAMEX>, Not Absolute
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurance</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> should design and implement internal control based on
the related cost and benefits. No matter how well designed and
operated, internal control cannot provide absolute assurance that
all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> objectives will be met. Factors outside the control or
influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> can affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s ability to achieve
all of its goals. For example, human mistakes, judgment errors, and
acts of collusion to circumvent control can affect meeting agency
objectives. Therefore, once in place, internal control provides
reasonable, not absolute, assurance of meeting agency
objectives.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control Standards</ENAMEX>

Presentation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX>

These standards define the minimum level of quality acceptable
for internal control in government and provide the basis against
which internal control is to be evaluated. These standards apply to
all aspects of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s operations: programmatic, financial, and
compliance. However, they are not intended to limit or interfere
with duly granted authority related to developing legislation,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rule-making</ENAMEX>, or other discretionary policy-making in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>.

These standards provide a general framework. In implementing these
standards, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is responsible for developing the detailed
policies, procedures, and practices to fit their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
operations and to ensure that they are built into and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">an integral</ENAMEX>
part of operations.
In the following material, each of these standards is presented
in a short, concise statement. Additional information is provided
to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> incorporate the standards into their daily
operations.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Environment</ENAMEX>

A positive control environment is the foundation for all other
standards. It provides discipline and structure as well as the
climate which influences the quality of internal control. Several
key factors affect the control environment.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> factor is the integrity and ethical values maintained and
demonstrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> plays a key
role in providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in this area, especially in setting
and maintaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s ethical tone, providing guidance
for proper behavior, removing temptations for unethical behavior,
and providing discipline when appropriate.
Another factor is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s commitment to competence. All
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> need to possess and maintain a level of competence that
allows them to accomplish their assigned duties, as well as
understand the importance of developing and implementing good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> needs to identify appropriate
knowledge and skills needed for various jobs and provide needed
training, as well as candid and constructive counseling, and
performance appraisals.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX>'s philosophy and operating style also affect the
environment. This factor determines the degree of risk the agency
is willing to take and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s philosophy towards
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">performance-based</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Further, the attitude and philosophy
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> toward information systems, accounting, personnel
functions, monitoring, and audits and evaluations can have a
profound effect on internal control.
Another factor affecting the environment is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
organizational structure. It provides management's framework for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX>, directing, and controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> to achieve agency
objectives. A good internal control environment requires that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s organizational structure clearly define key areas of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> and responsibility and establish appropriate lines of
reporting.
The environment is also affected by the manner in which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> authority and responsibility throughout the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> covers authority and responsibility
for operating activities, reporting relationships, and
authorization protocols.
Good human capital policies and practices are another critical
environmental factor. This includes establishing appropriate
practices for hiring, orienting, training, evaluating, counseling,
promoting, compensating, and disciplining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. It also
includes providing a proper amount of supervision.
A final factor affecting the environment is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and central oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> such
as OMB. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> mandates the programs that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> undertake and
monitors their progress and central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provide policy and
guidance on many different matters. In addition,
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)


Risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspectors General</ENAMEX> and internal senior management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">councils</ENAMEX> can
contribute to a good overall control environment.

A precondition to risk assessment is the establishment of clear,
consistent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> objectives. Risk assessment is the identification
and analysis of relevant risks associated with achieving the
objectives, such as those defined in strategic and annual
performance plans developed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and
Results Act, and forming a basis for determining how risks should
be managed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> needs to comprehensively identify risks and should
consider all significant interactions between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and other
parties as well as internal factors at both the entitywide and
activity level. Risk identification methods may include qualitative
and quantitative ranking activities, management conferences,
forecasting and strategic planning, and consideration of findings
from audits and other assessments.
Once risks have been identified, they should be analyzed for
their possible effect. Risk analysis generally includes estimating
the risk's significance, assessing the likelihood of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occurrence</ENAMEX>, and
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Activities</ENAMEX>
deciding how to manage the risk and what actions should be
taken. The specific risk analysis methodology used can vary by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> because of differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and the
difficulty in qualitatively and quantitatively assigning risk
levels.
Because governmental, economic, industry, regulatory, and
operating conditions continually change, mechanisms should be
provided to identify and deal with any special risks prompted by
such changes.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> activities are the policies, procedures, techniques, and
mechanisms that enforce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s directives, such as the
process of adhering to requirements for budget development and
execution. They help ensure that actions are taken to address
risks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> activities are an integral part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX>, implementing, reviewing, and accountability for
stewardship of government resources and achieving effective
results.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> activities occur at all levels and functions of the
entity. They include a wide range of diverse activities such as
approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations,
performance reviews,
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)
Examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Activities</ENAMEX>
maintenance of security, and the creation and maintenance of
related records which provide evidence of execution of these
activities as well as appropriate documentation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> activities
may be applied in a computerized information system environment or
through manual processes.
Activities may be classified by specific control objectives,
such as ensuring completeness and accuracy of information
processing.

There are certain categories of control activities that are
common to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Examples include the following:
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)

Reviews by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Functional</ENAMEX> or Activity Level
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management of Human Capital</ENAMEX>
Controls Over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Processing Management</ENAMEX> should track
major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> achievements and compare these to the plans, goals,
and objectives established under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and
Results Act.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> also need to compare actual performance to planned or
expected results throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and analyze
significant differences.
Effective management of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>-its human
capital-is essential to achieving results and an important part of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> should view human capital as an asset
rather than a cost. Only when the right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> for the job are
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and are provided the right training, tools, structure,
incentives, and responsibilities is operational success possible.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> should ensure that skill needs are continually assessed
and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is able to obtain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> that has
the required skills that match those necessary to achieve
organizational goals. Training should be aimed at developing and
retaining employee skill levels to meet changing organizational
needs. Qualified and continuous supervision should be provided to
ensure that internal control objectives are achieved. Performance
evaluation and feedback, supplemented by an effective reward
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, should be designed to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> understand the
connection between their performance and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>. As a part of its human capital planning, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> should
also consider how best to retain valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, plan for their
eventual succession, and ensure continuity of needed skills and
abilities.
A variety of control activities are used in information
processing. Examples include edit checks of data entered,
accounting for transactions in numerical sequences, comparing file
totals with control
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physical Control Over Vulnerable Assets</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Establishment and Review of Performance Measures</ENAMEX> and
Indicators
Segregation of Duties
Proper Execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Transactions</ENAMEX> and Events accounts, and
controlling access to data, files, and programs. Further guidance
on control activities for information processing is provided below
under "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Activities Specific for Information Systems</ENAMEX>."
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> must establish physical control to secure and
safeguard vulnerable assets. Examples include security for and
limited access to assets such as cash, securities, inventories, and
equipment which might be vulnerable to risk of loss or unauthorized
use. Such assets should be periodically counted and compared to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> records.
Activities need to be established to monitor performance
measures and indicators. These controls could call for comparisons
and assessments relating different sets of data to one another so
that analyses of the relationships can be made and appropriate
actions taken. Controls should also be aimed at validating the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">propriety</ENAMEX> and integrity of both organizational and individual
performance measures and indicators.
Key duties and responsibilities need to be divided or segregated
among different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to reduce the risk of error or fraud. This
should include separating the responsibilities for authorizing
transactions, processing and recording them, reviewing the
transactions, and handling any related assets. No one individual
should control all key aspects of a transaction or event.
Transactions and other significant events should be authorized
and executed only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> acting within the scope of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>. This is the principal means of assuring that only valid
transactions to exchange, transfer, use, or commit resources and
other events are initiated or entered
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)

into. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Authorizations</ENAMEX> should be clearly communicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
Transactions should be promptly recorded to maintain their
relevance and value to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and
making decisions. This applies to the entire process or life cycle
of a transaction or event from the initiation and authorization
through its final classification in summary records. In addition,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> activities help to ensure that all transactions are
completely and accurately recorded.
Access to resources and records should be limited to authorized
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and accountability for their custody and use should be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assigned</ENAMEX> and maintained. Periodic comparison of resources with the
recorded accountability should be made to help reduce the risk of
errors, fraud, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control and all transactions and other significant
events need to be clearly documented, and the documentation should
be readily available for examination. The documentation should
appear in management directives, administrative policies, or
operating manuals and may be in paper or electronic form. All
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> and records should be properly managed and
maintained.
These examples are meant only to illustrate the range and
variety of control activities that may be useful to agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>. They are not all-inclusive and may not include particular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> activities that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> may need.
Furthermore, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s internal control should be flexible to
allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to tailor control activities to fit their special
needs. The specific control activities used by a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> may
be different from those

used by others due to a number of factors. These could include
specific threats they face and risks they incur; differences in
objectives; managerial judgment; size and complexity of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>; operational environment; sensitivity and value of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>; and requirements for system reliability, availability, and
performance.

There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> broad groupings of information systems control -
general control and application control. General control applies to
all information systems-mainframe, minicomputer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, and
end-user environments. Application control is designed to cover the
processing of data within the application software.
This category includes entitywide security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> planning,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, control over data center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, system software
acquisition and maintenance, access security, and application
system development and maintenance. More specifically:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>-server <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> controls include backup
and recovery procedures, and contingency and disaster planning. In
addition, data center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> controls also include job set-up
and scheduling procedures and controls over operator
activities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Application Control</ENAMEX>


•
System software control includes control over the
acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of all system software
including the operating system, data-based management systems,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">telecommunications</ENAMEX>, security software, and utility
programs.


•
Access security control protects the systems and network
from inappropriate access and unauthorized use by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hackers</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trespassers</ENAMEX> or inappropriate use by agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. Specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> activities include frequent changes of dial-up numbers; use
of dial-back access; restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to allow access only to
system functions that they need; software and hardware "firewalls"
to restrict access to assets, computers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> by external
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>; and frequent changes of passwords and deactivation of
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' passwords.

Application system development and maintenance control
provides the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for safely developing new systems and
modifying existing systems. Included are documentation
requirements; authorizations for undertaking projects; and reviews,
testing, and approvals of development and modification activities
before placing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> into operation. An alternative to in-house
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is the procurement of commercial software, but control
is necessary to ensure that selected software meets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s
needs, and that it is properly placed into operation.


This category of control is designed to help ensure
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">completeness</ENAMEX>, accuracy, authorization, and validity of all
transactions during application processing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> should be
installed at an application's interfaces with other systems to
ensure that all inputs are received and are valid and outputs are
correct and properly distributed. An example is computerized edit
checks built into the system to review the format, existence, and
reasonableness of data.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> and application control over computer systems are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interrelated</ENAMEX>. General control supports the functioning of
application control, and both are needed to ensure complete and
accurate information processing. If the general control is
inadequate, the application control is unlikely to function
properly and could be overridden.
Because information technology changes rapidly, controls must
evolve to remain effective. Changes in technology and its
application to electronic commerce and expanding Internet
applications will change the specific control activities that may
be employed and how they are implemented, but the basic
requirements of control will not have changed. As more powerful
computers place more responsibility for data processing in the
hands of the end <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, the needed controls should be identified
and implemented.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information and Communications</ENAMEX>

For an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to run and control its operations, it must have
relevant, reliable, and timely communications relating to internal
as well as external events. Information is needed throughout the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> to achieve all of its objectives.
Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> need both operational and financial data to
determine whether they are meeting their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' strategic and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> performance plans and meeting their goals for accountability
for effective and efficient use of resources. For example,
operating information is required for development of financial
reports. This covers a broad range of data from purchases,
subsidies, and other transactions to data on fixed assets,
inventories, and receivables. Operating information is also needed
to determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is achieving its compliance
requirements under various laws and regulations. Financial
information is needed for both external and internal uses. It is
required to develop financial statements for periodic external
reporting, and, on a day-to-day basis, to make operating decisions,
montinor performance, and allocate resources. Pertinent information
should be identified, captured, and distributed in a form and time
frame that permits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to perform their duties efficiently.
Effective communications should occur in a broad sense with
information flowing down, across, and up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. In
additional to internal communications, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> should ensure
there are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining
information from, external stakeholders that may have a significant
impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> achieving its goals. Moreover, effective
information technology management is critical to achieving useful,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliable</ENAMEX>, and continuous recording and communication of
information.


Monitoring

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control should generally be designed to assure that
ongoing monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations. It is
performed continually and is ingrained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s operations.
It includes regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and supervisory activities,
comparisons, reconciliations, and other actions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take in
performing their duties.
Separate evaluations of control can also be useful by focusing
directly on the controls' effectiveness at a specific time. The
scope and frequency of separate evaluations should depend primarily
on the assessment of risks and the effectiveness of ongoing
monitoring procedures. Separate evaluations may take the form of
self-assessments as well as review of control design and direct
testing of internal control. Separate evaluations also may be
performed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> or an external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>.
Deficiencies found during ongoing monitoring or through separate
evaluations should be communicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> responsible
for the function and also to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> level of management above
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. Serious matters should be reported to top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.
Monitoring of internal control should include policies and
procedures for ensuring that the findings of audits and other
reviews are promptly resolved. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> are to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) promptly
evaluate findings from
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11/99</NUMEX>)
audits and other reviews, including those showing deficiencies
and recommendations reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and others who evaluate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' operations, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) determine proper actions in response to
findings and recommendations from audits and reviews, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
complete, within established time frames, all actions that correct
or otherwise resolve the matters brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s attention.
The resolution process begins when audit or other review results
are reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and is completed only after action has
been taken that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) corrects identified deficiencies, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) produces
improvements, or
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) demonstrates the findings and recommendationsdo not warrant
management action.
