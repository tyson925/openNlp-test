Preface
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have taken advantage of advancing
technology to streamline operations and reduce costs in financial
management systems. Specifically, in the payment processing area,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have redesigned or improved existing systems and have
formally requested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s views on the quality of internal control
designed into the new or modified systems. As part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
responsibility to issue internal control standards and our
commitment to improve financial management in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, we have
worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to assist them in saving <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX>
while ensuring that effective control was also included in the
systems designs and modifications.
Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' designs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> modifications have
been creative and innovative in streamlining payment systems and
reducing costs. In each case, after working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, we
summarized their designs and our positions with regard to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control in their designs. We have aggregated the views in
our individual letters into this booklet as a guide to agencies
which are reengineering their payment systems. Our intentions are
to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) assist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in maintaining sound internal control and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) help them focus requests for our assistance on the
effectiveness of planned internal control for revised payment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.
This guide is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. The first
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> covers background information about traditional payment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and the changes occurring in them. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section
focuses on advancing technology and its impact on payment systems.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> section deals with streamlining efforts in the payment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> involving the purchase of goods and services while the last
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> deals with streamlining efforts in the employee travel
payment systems.

Introduction
This document contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sections. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> section provides
an overview of the traditional payment systems to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> for the
acquisition of goods and services and to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> as a result of
government travel. It describes the major processing components of
the payment system and focuses on the basic internal control that
should have existed within these traditional systems to emphasize
that these same control objectives should always be satisfied as
payment systems change and evolve.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section discusses the role of advancing technology
and its effect on major changes that have and continue to occur in
payment systems. The basic internal control discussed in
traditional payment systems is emphasized as the key ingredient in
maintaining effective payment systems regardless of the changes
occurring. Also discussed are advances in technology, which have in
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> begun to be used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, but for which wide
spread application will likely occur in the foreseeable future.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> cover details of the numerous
requests we have received, including a description of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>'
systems designs and modifications and our views on the
effectiveness of the designed internal control in the proposed
changes. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> section covers payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> for the
acquisition of goods and services and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> section covers
payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> for government travel. The requests and our
responses focus mostly on internal control regarding the automation
of payment systems or the conversion from manual to automated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appendix covers relevant issues addressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
reports (responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> requests). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> appendix
provides a brief discussion about relevant systems standards issued
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Financial Management Improvement Program</ENAMEX> (JFMIP). The
last page lists the products that form the basis for this
document.
In carrying out our responsibilities to work with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, we
have published and periodically updated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
PolicyandProceduresManual forGuidanceofFederalAgencies. This manual
is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> major parts called titles. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX>, "Fiscal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guidance</ENAMEX>," provides guidance in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> including areas
covering our responsibility to settle accounts of accountable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, issue internal control standards, and respond to agencies
that inquire about these matters. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> contains extensive
coverage on the payment process, which is the subject of this
document, and provides the basic concepts and criteria we rely on
in assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and responding to their requests.


Background
This section discusses the traditional payment process,
modifications to the traditional payment process, and the
importance of internal control in effectively administering the
payment process. It also provides the basic concepts and criteria
contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX>, "Fiscal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guidance</ENAMEX>," of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PolicyandProceduresManualforGuidanceofFederalAgencies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX>
provisions form the basis for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> developed in response
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' requests for our views on proposed new payment systems
or modifications to streamline the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> of existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.


Traditional Payment Process
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> identifies the following steps of the acquisition and
payment process involving general purchases: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) purchase
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authorization</ENAMEX> (the ordering function), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) receipt and acceptance
of the items ordered,


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
receipt of the invoice, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) payment approval and
authorization, and


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
actual payment (disbursement of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX>). None of the
requests we received for assistance involved the actual payment
part of the process, and therefore we are not covering that aspect
in this document.


The purchase authorization portion of the process is the formal
approval of the purchase by responsible designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> within
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> and usually results in the obligation of budget
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>. The receipt and acceptance portion generally involves a
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> taking possession of the items purchased and
verifying quantity and quality of the items received. Receipt of
the invoice or bill from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> represents a claim
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for the items sent or delivered per the
government's purchase order.
The payment approval and authorization portions of the process
can involve a multistep process with administrative approvals being
first
Background
followed by payment authorization<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> An administrative approval
is generally performed by a responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> that
ordered or received the items purchased. The administrative
approval normally is based on verification that the items ordered
were actually received and met the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s specifications, and
thus validates a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>'s request (invoice) for payment.
Payment authorization is generally restricted to designated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> can be held personally
liable, under certain circumstances, for authorizations made by
them. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are responsible for ensuring the legality,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">propriety</ENAMEX>, validity, and accuracy of all payments they authorize.
Specifically, they must determine whether:


•
the payment is permitted by law;


•
the appropriation amounts are available at the time and
are being used for the intended purpose;


•
the goods and services have been received and conform to
the requirements of the order or agreement;


•
the required administrative approvals have been obtained;
and


•
the quantities, prices, and calculations are
accurate.


As used in this document, administrative approvals are
differentiated from payment authorization. Payment authorization
(also called payment certification) refers to the act of approving
payment and authorizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> to disburse funds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> designated to be certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> (who certify
payment) must have certain documents on file with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, must
follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> regulations, and can be held legally liable for
payments they authorize. Administrative approvals, on the other
hand, refer to the approval function of various aspects of a
transaction except for payment authorization. Administrative
approvals include, but are not limited to, obligation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX> (for
example, authorizing the purchase of goods, approving employee
travel, approving contracts on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>); accepting
goods and services delivered to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> per order or contract;
and approving travel vouchers for payment scheduling. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> authorized to perform administrative approvals are
generally required to follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> policies and procedures as
opposed to statutory requirements and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> regulations followed
by certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>.
Because certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>' responsibilities cover the payment
they authorized, their responsibilities can extend to most aspects
of a transaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> performing administrative approvals
usually are responsible for fewer aspects of a transaction. For
example, the administrative approval of an employee's travel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">voucher</ENAMEX> (usually performed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>) generally
confirms the reasonableness of the claim and that the travel
actually took place. The certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, however, not only
verifies that the voucher contains an administrative approval
ensuring that the travel took place, but also performs numerous
examination procedures to ensure all claims are within regulations
and limitations.
Background
Traditionally, certifying or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disbursing</ENAMEX> officers2
responsibilities extended throughout the payment process. They had
staff assisting them in reviewing each invoice prior to payment
authorization. This review is referred to as the "prepayment
examination." The examination consisted of several steps, primarily
focusing on comparing information on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> critical documents-the
obligation or ordering document, the receiving and inspection
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">document</ENAMEX> (normally called a receiving report), and the invoice. The
information on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> documents had to be of sufficient detail
to allow an effective comparison to occur. The information had to
include specific identification of the good or service (e.g., stock
numbers, detailed descriptions, grades or quality, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> or
models); quantities ordered, received, and billed; the quality
(type, grade, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX>) of the items received; and prices per
unit. If necessary, the invoice was adjusted to reflect the items
actually received and accepted. While examining the documents, the
staff also was required to verify that the documentation had the
necessary administrative approvals. For example, such approvals
could be evidenced by purchase orders signed by an authorized
official or travel orders and vouchers signed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX>.
Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was satisfied that the invoice reflected a legal,
proper, valid, and accurate amount, the invoice was deemed ready
for payment. The invoice amount, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an adjusted</NUMEX> or modified amount,
was prepared for payment on a specific form. In the civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>,
payment information (payee and amount) traditionally was entered on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Form 1166, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Voucher and Schedule of Payments</ENAMEX>. The specific
form was forwarded along with the related supporting documents to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> certifying or disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> for review and
approval. Once approved, by signature, the form without the
supporting documents was forwarded to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> (for civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>)
or another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> under the disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX>) for actual
payment.
Lastly, the hard copy documents (i.e., obligation document,
receiving report, and the invoice) supporting a disbursement were
normally filed centrally at the certifying or disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s
location for easy access in the event of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> review or
outside audit of the payment process. The documents had to be
retained for specified periods and be stored under certain
procedures in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 8</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records Management</ENAMEX>," of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PolicyandProceduresManual</ENAMEX>.
Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Law 104106</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Defense Authorization</ENAMEX>
Act for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fiscal Year 1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOD</ENAMEX> was given the authority to have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">certifying</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>. Prior to that, disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> usually
approved vouchers for payment.
Background


Modifications to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traditional Payment Process</ENAMEX>
The traditional payment approval process has been modified over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> primarily through the application of statistical sampling
and "fast pay" procedures, and the widespread use of computer
technology. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer</ENAMEX> technology is discussed in the next section.)
Statistical sampling was initially implemented in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> to
reduce the cost of the payment process while still affording
confidence that payments were processed accurately. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> procedures implemented involved a random selection of
invoices from a known universe of invoices below a certain dollar
amount (currently set at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,5003</NUMEX>)tobe examined in lieu of examining
all invoices as would be done under a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100percent</TIMEX> examination. Fast
pay was implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, in certain circumstances, on
a larger scale during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in meeting the
payment timing requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Prompt Payment Act</ENAMEX>. It involved
the examination of invoices after payment in lieu of prepayment
examination<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
It should be noted that statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> and fast pay
procedures neither reduce the need for effective internal control
nor relieve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">certifying</ENAMEX>/disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of his or her
responsibility. They merely provide a mechanism to reduce clerical
costs and expedite processing while continuing to meet prompt
payment requirements and maintain effective internal control.
Statistical sampling allows conclusions to be made about (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the
universe of invoices from which the sample was selected and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
procedures in effect used to process all invoices in the universe.
Examination of the sample and evaluation of the results permits
correction of errors and other deficiencies found in the items
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sampled</ENAMEX> and the procedures and controls directly related to the
items. It also permits projections as to the quality of all
invoices in the universe.
Prior to implementing sampling procedures, a sampling plan
should be developed. The plan should include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a definition of
the universe of invoices to be examined, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the size and selection
method of the sample based on the risks of the invoice processing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) procedures to analyze the results of the sample, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) methods to document the plan and the analysis.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB Circular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A125</ENAMEX> (revised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12/12/89</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PromptPayment</ENAMEX>, which
provided guidance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Prompt Payment Act</ENAMEX>, permits under certain
conditions, the use of fast pay procedures to pay vendor invoices
without evidence of receipt and acceptance at the time of

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">certification</ENAMEX> and payment. (See footnote <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.)
Background
Compared to the prepayment examination of all invoices,
implementing sampling procedures increases the risks of
overpayments occurring and going undetected. This risk can be
acceptably mitigated if the plan calls for invoice examination to
be commensurate with the risk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The plan should
convincingly demonstrate that statistical sampling procedures would
produce administrative savings while adequately protecting the
interests of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savings</ENAMEX> would be achieved if the
combined costs of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) examining the sample and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) projected losses
due to undetected errors on invoices not examined are less than the
administrative cost of examining all invoices.
Effective control over disbursements ordinarily requires
examination of invoices before they are approved for payment.
However, fast pay procedures typically entail payment authorization
without evidence of receipt and acceptance, provided that
subsequent to payment authorization, receipt and acceptance is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verified</ENAMEX>. Under fast pay, examination of the invoice subsequent to
payment authorization is sometimes referred to as "post payment
examination." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB Circular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A125</ENAMEX> PromptPayment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,5</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prompt Payment</ENAMEX>
Act, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Acquisition Regulation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAR</ENAMEX>), part 13 provide
guidance on implementing fast pay. Based on that guidance, fast pay
is currently subject to a limitation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> per invoice and the
following conditions: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) geographical separation and lack of
communication facilities make it impractical to make timely
payments based on evidence of acceptance, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> who will be
paid under the procedure have agreed to repair, correct, or replace
goods or services not conforming to requirements, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) and it is
limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> who have had and continue to have a good
ongoing business relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>.
Normally, under fast pay procedures, all invoices are examined
subsequent to payment authorization. However, combining statistical
sampling with fast pay procedures is permitted under appropriate
circumstances. Although such a combination increases the risks of
overpayments occurring, the risks can be effectively mitigated if
the sampling plan developed ensures that projected savings exceed
estimated costs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> revised the circular effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 29, 1999</TIMEX>. The
requirements and the guidance in the circular were then placed in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Code</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Regulations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.F.R. part</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1315</TIMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prompt</ENAMEX>
Payment") and the circular was rescinded.
Background


Importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Effective Internal Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Systems</ENAMEX>
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s internal control over the payment process should
be based on the operating needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. In particular, the
units that process payments under the direction of the certifying
and disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> should have in place effective internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">activities6</ENAMEX> to ensure payments are legal, proper, valid,
and accurate and that duplicate payments are avoided.
Under traditional payment processes, certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>
reviewed all invoices they authorized for payment. Although the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">certifying</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> are primarily responsible for payments
authorized, the volume of transactions, the geographic dispersion
of activities, and the emphasis on prompt payment make it virtually
impossible for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to review all invoices before
authorizing payment. Consequently, in fulfilling their
responsibilities, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> must rely on the systems, internal
controls, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> that process the transactions. As a result,
payment process oversight has generally shifted from individual
transaction reviews to reviews of internal control over systems
that process the transactions.
This shift in emphasis from approval of individual transactions
to evaluations of the adequacy of systems and the internal control
environment has been reflected in law and in policy for numerous
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Managers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Financial Integrity Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>
requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> assess and report on the
adequacy of internal control. The guidance needed to comply with
this act is contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s
StandardsforInternalControlintheFederalGovernment7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB Circular</ENAMEX>
A123 (revised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 21, 1995</TIMEX>), Managementand
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AccountabilityControl</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Federal Financial Management Improvement Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
requires, among other things, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> implement and maintain
financial management systems that substantially comply with federal
financial management systems requirements. These system
requirements are detailed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Management Systems</ENAMEX>
Requirements series issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Financial Management</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Improvement Program</ENAMEX> (JFMIP) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB Circular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A127</ENAMEX> (revised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 10</TIMEX>,

include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a framework for financial management systems, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) core
financial management systems
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
Examples of internal control include separation of duties,
limited access to assets and information, clear documentation of
all transactions and events, and the timely recording of
transactions and events.

requirements, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) requirements for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> other systems that
support agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. (See appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> for a further
description of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFMIP</ENAMEX> systems requirements series.)
While new technologies and reengineering of business processes
may change how certifying and disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> operate, their
basic responsibilities and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountabilities</ENAMEX> remain unaltered.
Consequently, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> must have valid and documented
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurances</ENAMEX> that the systems and key controls on which they rely for
authorizing payments are working as intended and remain intact and
effective over time. This confidence in the systems and control
should be based on several factors; among the most significant are
the following:


•
A welldefined organizational structure and flow of work,
appropriate separation of responsibilities, and clearly written
policies and procedures governing purchase authorization, receipt
of goods and services, and examination and approval of invoices for
payment.


•
Effective application of available technology for
efficient and effective acquisition of goods and services and
processing of payment authorization.


•
Review of the invoice examination process in sufficient
scope, depth, and frequency to provide reasonable assurance that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and controls are working as intended and are
reliable.




Advancing Technology
The repetitive nature of processing most transactions and the
uniform examination procedures applied to invoice processing
usually permit extensive automation of these processes. In lieu of
the traditional practice of performing a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">100percent</NUMEX> manual
prepayment examination of invoices, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> today process large
volumes of transactions in highly automated systems with automated
controls, electronic data interchange, and computer assisted
examination techniques.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> entry edits to ensure accurate and reliable data processing
are relatively simple to develop and use. Edits are programmed to
perform various comparisons, verifications, and calculations to
produce outputs that effectively replace many of the manual invoice
processing and examination procedures. As the sophistication and
the number of edits continue to evolve and become more widely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have been revising
their automated payment processes to reflect these improvements
while at the same time making their systems more efficient.
Hard copy documentation that is necessary to support invoice
examination and payment authorizations is giving way to electronic
forms which reduce retention and storage costs while concurrently
enhancing access capabilities. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s proper application of
available technology makes it possible to perform the required
prepayment examination without assembling hard copy records from
diverse locations as in the past. With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s technology,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> can extract data from hard copy source records, input the
information into the automated system through computer terminals,
and forward the data through communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> to a
centralized location for further online processing, examination,
and payment authorization. However, implementation of available
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> does not change the requirement that audit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> of
transactions and authorizations be maintained or the rigors of
examination of invoices not be compromised.
Although automation of payment processes helps streamline
operations, the basic responsibilities of the certifying and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disbursing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> remain the same. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> must have
sufficient knowledge of the automated systems in order to carry out
their responsibilities effectively. They are still responsible for
making sure that they can rely on the quality of the automated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> to ensure that invoices authorized for payment are legal,
proper, valid, and correct.
The quality of the automated systems is to a large extent based
on the effectiveness of internal control. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control over
automated systems can be grouped into general control and
application control. General


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Signatures</ENAMEX>
Advancing Technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> applies to all information systems-mainframe,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">minicomputer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, and enduser environment. Application control
is designed to cover the processing of data within application
software.8 To ensure the quality of the automated systems,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> must provide the environment for effective
implementation of general and application controls.
Automated environments naturally require various levels of
access in order to permit data entry, appropriate data manipulation
(i.e., calculations, summarization, and reporting), program
modifications, and data review and approval. Generally, access,
authorization, and approvals are permitted through various controls
and electronic symbols or programmed data elements. The degree of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over access to automated systems for data entry,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">examinations</ENAMEX>, reviews, and approvals will vary. User identification
codes and passwords provide less control over data than do
electronic signatures. An electronic signature is a method of
signing an electronic message that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) identifies and authenticates
a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> as the source of the electronic message and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
indicates such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s approval of the information contained in
the electronic message<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>
An electronic signature is a data authentication process, which
when effectively implemented, provides assurance that data
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the signature has not been altered or changed.
Traditional user identification codes and passwords, while
permitted under certain circumstances, do not. To be effective, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
recommends that electronic signatures be
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) unique to the signer, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">signer</ENAMEX>'s sole control,
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) capable of verification. In addition, the signature should
be linked to the data in such a manner that if the data are
changed, the signature is invalidated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards and Technology</ENAMEX> (NIST)<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> has established procedures for
the evaluation and approval of certain automated signature

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enhancing Internal Control and Data Integrity</ENAMEX>
In developing electronic data authentication systems, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Title</ENAMEX> 7
recommends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX> guidance for payment approval
(payment certification). Automated approvals, when the risks
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with automated records and approvals warrant it, might
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necessitate</ENAMEX> electronic signatures that follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX> guidance. The
Government <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Elimination Act</ENAMEX> requires OMB to issue guidance
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> regarding automated systems that maintain electronic
information as a substitute for paper and use electronic
signatures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s published <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">guidance12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should
perform an assessment to evaluate the suitability of electronic
signature alternatives for a particular application. Among other
things, the assessment should develop strategies to mitigate risks
and maximize benefits in the context of available technologies, and
the relative total costs and effects of implementing those
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>.
In its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FrameworkforFederalFinancialManagementSystems</ENAMEX>, JFMIP
envisioned automated systems with standardized information and
electronic data exchange to eliminate manual processes, reduce the
risks of data loss or errors, and eliminate manual reentry and
interpretation. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> states that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should endeavor to
establish automated techniques, including data interchange, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> whenever feasible so long as the interests of the
government are protected.
Although many current payment systems are highly automated, the
technological changes envisioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFMIP</ENAMEX> have not yet been fully
realized. There are several major areas in the payment process
where technological advances have had and will continue to have a
substantial impact. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of these areas include: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the
automation of receipt and acceptance, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) electronic signatures,
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> regarding examination of claims in the
payment process.
Although some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have automated part of the receipt and
acceptance function, widespread application has not yet occurred.
As the application of advancing technology continues, systems will
be able to directly transmit receipt and acceptance data from
points of purchase to central locations for invoice examination and
payment authorization. Transmissions of receipt and acceptance data
will come from multiple locations and possibly from vendor
locations where, for example, a government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> transmits data
electronically from a fueling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' remote
locations, including field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and sea vessels. Electronically
submitted data will alleviate many of the current

"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information and Regulatory Policy</ENAMEX>."
Advancing Technology
problems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> face in locating hard copy receiving reports
and manually reconciling receipt data to invoice amounts.
Once the electronic data are received centrally, the examination
process could be more automated. Receipt and acceptance data could
be compared electronically to the ordering and the invoice
information to help ensure that payment authorization is valid and
at the same time reduce the risk of errors in the process. Also,
the cost of the examination process would be reduced due to the
elimination of manual reconciliation procedures. The time and
effort needed to locate receiving reports would also not exist, and
prompt payment requirements (taking advantage of discounts and
avoiding late payment fees) could more easily be met.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> guidance states that automated techniques should depend
upon risks, benefits, and cost effectiveness associated with the
automated applications. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies</ENAMEX> should determine whether any
electronic signature alternative, in conjunction with appropriate
process controls, represents a practicable tradeoff between
benefits on the one hand and cost and risk on the other. Electronic
signatures meeting the aforementioned criteria, however, can
provide the necessary data integrity for highly automated systems
because the signature "seals" the data once it is applied. Any
subsequent alterations to the data can be readily detected. Because
of the nature of electronic data, it is sometimes difficult to
ascertain whether the data have been altered or manipulated unless
the signature is linked to the data in such a way that the
signature verification process can detect data changes. Passwords
and identification codes generally do not provide this detection
capability.
Although implementation of electronic signatures meeting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NIST</ENAMEX> criteria may not currently be costeffective in all cases, or
may not be needed because the electronic data application is low
risk, technological advances will continue to occur, making the
signatures more affordable and widespread in the future. Combining
the automation of the receipt and acceptance process with the
widespread use of electronic signatures could be a major move
towards full automation.
With full automation, statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> of invoices prior to
payment to make inferences about the universe would no longer be
necessary since the system would perform a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">100percent</NUMEX> verification
of receipt and acceptance. Statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> would only be
needed for monitoring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system operations</ENAMEX> through periodic
testing. Aspects of the system that could be tested through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> might include verifying that the electronic recording of
receipt and acceptance was supported by other sources.
Advancing Technology
Also, under full automation, fast pay could be eliminated in
most situations. Since the system would automatically verify all
receipts and acceptances prior to invoice payment authorization,
there would be no need to authorize payment prior to verification
of receipt. Moreover, systems could be designed and operated to
contain specific control mechanisms to prevent payment
authorization either manually or in an automated environment prior
to confirmation of receipt and acceptance.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Authorization</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fast Pay</ENAMEX>)
In an effort to streamline operations and reduce costs while
taking advantage of currently available technology, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
have redesigned or modified their payment systems. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
have requested opinions from us on whether proposed new payment
system designs or proposed system modifications conform to the
requirements of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> internal controls. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX>' specific
questions regarding their payment systems for the acquisition of
goods, along with our responses, are organized into the following
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> sections. Since we did not test the proposed changes, our
responses only addressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' proposals conceptually.
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> asked whether certain changes to their existing
payment process complied with the internal control requirements of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX>. At the time of the request, their procedures required the
verification of receipt and acceptance prior to authorization of
payment. The proposed changes would allow payment on invoices under
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> prior to verification of receipt and acceptance of the
items purchased.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response Payment</ENAMEX> authorization prior to verifying receipt
and acceptance is a common process referred to as "fast pay." Since
specific authority to implement a fast pay process for the
acquisition of goods and services at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> exists as set forth
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB Circular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A12513</ENAMEX> and FAR, our permission is not necessary.
However, we responded to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> requests for assistance in
designing and implementing effective internal controls.
In responding to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' requests, we verified that
their designs met the fast pay requirements previously discussed
(limitation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX>, geographical separation, ongoing
relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, and methods to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>
abusing fast pay). If the designed procedures met the requirements,
we did not object to the implementation of fast pay. In keeping
with the fast pay requirements, we also suggested that the system
designs include procedures to identify <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and
vendors with a history of abusing fast pay.These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> would not
be eligible to participate in fast pay until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> had
satisfied itself that those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> were worthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> that
could be paid under fast pay.
In each case, we further suggested that, as part of its required
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMFIA</ENAMEX> review of its internal controls, special emphasis be given to
testing controls of the new processes to help ensure effective
implementation.
13See footnote 4.


<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Combining Statistical Sampling With Fast Pay</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> requesting guidance on internal controls when
implementing fast pay have also designed procedures to verify
receipt and acceptance of goods ordered on an afterthefact sampling
basis rather than on the basis of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">100percent</NUMEX> postpayment
verification as is traditionally done. We reviewed the proposals
involving the statistical sampling verification procedures.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> limits statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> to invoices under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500</NUMEX>.
Combining statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> with fast pay procedures increases
the risks that overpayments would occur and go undetected compared
to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">100percent</NUMEX> verification of receipt and acceptance. These risks
would be acceptably mitigated if the statistical sampling plan
provided for (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the scope or extent of invoice examination to be
commensurate with the risk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,14</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) sampling from
the universe of all invoices under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500</NUMEX> not subject to complete
examination, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) effective monitoring to ensure that the plan is
effectively implemented and the risks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> remain
within tolerable limits, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) a continuing relationship with the
vendor so that the risk of loss is minimized. We did not object to
implementing sampling so long as the plan included these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
items.
In a variation of the preceding, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> proposed to
implement a statistical sampling process where the sample
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX> was increased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500 to $25,000</NUMEX>, the same
limitation for fast pay. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> would require the purchasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to notify the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (where payment certification
took place) within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 days</TIMEX> of the receipt of the invoice only in
instances where the actual receipt of goods differed from the
order, thus affecting payment.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> would limit the use of this process to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> with
whom it had an ongoing satisfactory relationship. To ensure that
the purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> compared invoices to receiving reports
subsequent to payment authorization, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> would regularly
examine statistical samples of paid invoices, provide adequate
training for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and regularly review implementation of
controls. Our response was that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> followed through with
its proposed controls and that the benefits derived exceeded the
cost, the modifications would be in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX>. As
with other requests, we recommended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s
subsequent
14
In developing a sample plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should make sure that
their proposed procedures would produce savings while adequately
protecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savings</ENAMEX>, as defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Title</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, would be achieved when the combined cost of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) examining the
sample and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) projected losses due to undetected errors on
invoices not examined are less than the cost of examining all
vouchers. Through analysis, the plan must develop and identify a
tolerable error rate (the point at which, or below which, savings
should occur), the number of vouchers to select for examination,
and the selection method.



<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fast Pay Combined With Statistical Sampling When Weak Internal</ENAMEX>
Controls Exist
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMFIA</ENAMEX> reviews specifically emphasize testing the effectiveness
of the controls over its fast pay procedures and related
statistical sampling.
In the previous discussions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> requesting our assistance
had designed but not yet implemented fast pay. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>,
where fast pay procedures had been implemented for the acquisition
of certain goods, was moving toward verifying receipt and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> of invoices on a sampling basis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> (OIG) had asked us whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s fast pay
procedures combined with statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> was permissible. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OIG</ENAMEX> reported that, over a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5month</NUMEX> period, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 per cent</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invoices</ENAMEX> paid under the fast pay process had incorrect or missing
support. That review and process uncovered missing or inaccurate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on order forms and receiving reports. The errors occurred
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> controls existed in the review and processing of
invoices for payment.
Also, during our discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, we were told
that many invoices processed for payment were likely to exceed the
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> limitation of fast pay.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
We responded to the request by stating that although fast pay is
permitted under certain criteria, the purchases under the process
inquired about would not meet the criteria (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) where the purchase
exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> or
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) if the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10percent</NUMEX> error rate is considered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to be above the tolerable acceptable error rate.
Regarding sampling of invoices after payment authorization to
verify receipt and acceptance, we pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> limits
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> to invoices under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500</NUMEX>. Without a specific request to
raise the limitation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,15</NUMEX> we stated that verification of receipt and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> would be required for all invoices equal to or greater
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500</NUMEX>. In addition, we stated that sampling should not be
implemented if the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10percent</NUMEX> error rate is considered above the
acceptable error rate.
15
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding</TIMEX> section on the discussion of combining
statistical sampling with fast pay, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> had proposed a
design under which sampling would be done for all invoices <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX>
or less. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> responded to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s proposal as to whether it
could raise the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500</NUMEX> limitation to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX>. However, in this
request, we were not provided a design nor asked if the limitation
could be raised.



Processing Payment Without an Invoice
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> whether it would be permissible to
make purchase order or contract payments (without a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invoice</ENAMEX>) solely on the basis of a receiving report or other
documentary evidence showing receipt and acceptance. This entity
had designed a payment system whereby the acquisition of certain
goods and services made under maintenance contracts and purchase
orders would not require an invoice to generate a payment.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
We reviewed the proposed payment processes and responded by
stating that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> identifies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> typical steps to ensure
proper payment is authorized: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the acquisition of goods and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> was properly authorized as evidenced by an approved
purchase order or contract,



(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
the goods and services ordered have been delivered and
accepted, evidenced by a receiving and inspection report, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) a
claim has been made against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> as evidenced by receipt
of an invoice or bill. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vendor</ENAMEX>'s billing and government payment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> have been traditionally designed and operated with the
invoice being the primary document initiating the payment process.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX>, however, does not preclude payment from being authorized
without an invoice if adequate internal controls exist to protect
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s interest.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> specific areas where internal control should be given
special attention when authorizing payments without invoices are:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) payment is initiated only after receipt and acceptance of
ordered goods and services and is authorized only after matching
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and quantities received with those on the purchase order
or contract<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,16</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) controls exist to insure against duplicate
payment should a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> mistakenly seek payment for goods or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> for which payment has already been made, and


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
payments are made to coincide with the due dates to take
advantage of discount terms or avoid late payment penalties.17 The
proposed design contained sufficient control in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> areas
to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s interest. We did not object to the
system design so long as steps were taken to ensure effective
implementation.





Record <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Retention at Field Offices or Sites</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> requesting our assistance on designing and
implementing fast pay also asked if the key documents (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i. e.</ENAMEX>
purchase order, receiving report, and invoice) could be retained in
the field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>
16
A purchase order or contract should contain details of the type
or quality of goods or services (e.g. model, stock number,
quantity, per item price, discount, and payment due date).
17
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> blanket contracts should stipulate discount terms and
late payment dates.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
or sites where the purchase was initiated. Instead of sending
supporting documentation to the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for payment
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">certification</ENAMEX>, a purchase log or other summary information would be
maintained and all pertinent data would be entered into it, signed
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchaser</ENAMEX> and approving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, and sent to the finance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> for payment authorization. Periodically, samples of all paid
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invoices</ENAMEX> would be selected and the supporting documentation
reviewed to verify the validity of the payment. Field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and
sites would then be required to forward the related documentation
for all the transactions selected in the sample.
We stated that, although supporting documents are traditionally
maintained at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">certifying</ENAMEX>/disbursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s location, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Title</ENAMEX> 7
did not preclude the documents being retained at the field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>
or sites. However, we emphasized that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> responsible for
maintaining the documents must be familiar with the retention and
storage requirements set forth in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 8</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records Management</ENAMEX>," of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Policyand ProceduresManualand</ENAMEX> that they might be requested
to forward the documents for review by the certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>.
We suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> inform the field office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> samples of all payment transactions would be selected for
the purpose of verifying the validity of the payments and that they
would be required to forward all documents related to the selected
transactions to the certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s location for review. We
also suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provide the field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> staff
with training to familiarize them with the retention and storage
requirements. We did not object to retaining documents at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> or
site locations provided the suggestions we made were
implemented.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Imaging One</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> asked us if electronic images
(i.e.,an electroniccopyor image of a paper document) constituted an
acceptable record. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s plan was to convert financial
paper records (such as payment vouchers and related supporting
documents) into electronic records. After the conversion, the paper
documents would be destroyed and the electronic records would
become the official records of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response GAO</ENAMEX> has long recognized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> records need
not be maintained in their original paperbased form. For example,
we have found that microfilm and similar technologies are
acceptable methods for storing data originally on paper. Electronic
technology that allows data to be examined in human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">readable form</ENAMEX>,
as on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX>, stored in electronic
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/AIMD21.3.2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/00</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>, recalled from storage, and reviewed in human readable
form can provide data integrity that is equal to that of a paper
document.
Any system, regardless of the technology used, must incorporate
adequate controls to ensure the integrity of the data. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> must ensure that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the digital images accurately
represent the corresponding paper document, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) any changes to the
original digital image can be detected,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) access to the images is limited to authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> for
authorized purposes, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) the digital images are not destroyed,
but remain accessible until the applicable retention period
expires. Although authorized changes to an image may need to be
made, the unaltered copy of the original image should be maintained
to facilitate adequate audit trails.
We did not object to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s electronic imaging plan so
long as internal control was implemented to ensure that the
criteria in the preceding paragraph were met.



Streamlining the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Payment Process- Employee Travel Claims</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Vouchers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Edits</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Authorizing Payment</ENAMEX>
BasedonElectronic Validation
In an effort to streamline operations and reduce costs while
taking advantage of currently available technology, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
have redesigned or modified their employee travel claim payment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have requested our opinion on whether
newly designed systems or modified ones conform to the requirements
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> regarding internal control. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX>' specific questions
regarding these systems along with our responses are organized into
the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> sections.
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration</ENAMEX> (GSA) is responsible
for issuing federal travel regulations, which are published in the
Code of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Regulations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.F.R.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">301</NUMEX>), we have provided our
views on the internal control considerations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' system
designs pursuant to our authority to issue internal control
standards. Since we did not test <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' proposals, our responses
only address <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' proposals conceptually.
In streamlining their employee travel systems, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
designed automated systems containing electronic travel vouchers
and requested our assistance in interpreting <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> requirements
and assessing their designed internal controls.
While each of the designs had minor differences, they generally
called for a commercial software package modified to fit specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> needs. The software contained a travel voucher form in two
parts, a summary of the claims, and related detail supporting
amounts. After completing the travel, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> completed the
forms and signed the voucher electronically. The electronic forms
contained the same information as the standard government hard copy
travel voucher. After the voucher was completed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s
supervisor reviewed it. During the review of the voucher, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> could ask for supporting hard copy documents (e.g.,
hotel receipts) if additional detail was needed to verify any of
the claims on the voucher. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> would then approve the
voucher electronically. The approval signified reasonable assurance
that the travel actually took place and that the claimed amounts
were reasonable.
The supervisory approved voucher would then be forwarded
electronically to the certifying or payment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> for approval of
payment. Numerous electronic edits would be applied to the voucher
at the certifying or payment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s location prior to payment
authorization. The edits could, for example, verify that the travel
has been authorized and compare information on the voucher to
information on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> files to test the validity of the claims
(i.e., that the claims were proper, legal, and accurate).
Information to be compared could include, for example, data on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveler</ENAMEX> (e.g., name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> or social security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX>, etc.) and
limitations such as per diem amounts allowed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> where the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> stayed. If the edits did not uncover any discrepancies,
the voucher would be approved for payment.
Subsequent to payment, the designs called for a review of the
supporting documentation related to the travel vouchers. Those
vouchers which would be reviewed included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) all vouchers
exceeding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500</NUMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a random sample selected from all vouchers
for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500</NUMEX> or less. The supporting documents would be examined to
help verify the validity of the claims and the effectiveness of the
system.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> does not require payment approval of travel vouchers to
be based solely on the traditional review of supporting
documentation if adequate controls compensate for not reviewing
such documentation. In addition to the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and approval of the voucher, the primary compensating
controls designed were the automated edits and computations to
ensure that the travel claims complied with all requirements.
Although automated edits assist in determining the validity of a
claim, they cannot determine whether the claim was properly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documented</ENAMEX> nor can they fully replace the role of a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reviewer</ENAMEX>.
The plan to test vouchers on a sample basis after payment
authorization for vouchers <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,500</NUMEX> or less should give further
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurances</ENAMEX> that the claims are valid. The sample should follow a
plan that provides for voucher examination against hardcopy
documents to be commensurate with the risk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and a
sample from the universe of all vouchers not subject to complete
examination.
We did not object to the implementation of the automated travel
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, but suggested that, to help ensure effective
implementation, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> emphasize testing controls in its new
designs during its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> review of internal control as required by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMFIA</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Retaining Supporting Documentation</ENAMEX>
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> designing automated employee travel voucher systems
discussed in the previous section also asked us if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>
could retain the supporting hardcopy documentation. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
stated that part of the streamlining effort would include reducing
the time, effort, and cost of moving paper documents through a
manual system, reviewing and approving the documents, and filing
the documents at the certifying or payment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s location.
Reducing the paper flow would also result in faster payments since
the system would not be relying solely on hard copy documents.
Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> that either retire or leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> prior
the expiration of the retention period, the designs called for an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> checkout procedure whereby clearance from their travel
unit (as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>) is required prior
to receiving their last salary payment.
Traditionally, hardcopy documents have been retained at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">certifying</ENAMEX> or payment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s location for ease in accessibility.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> does not preclude the documents from being
maintained at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s location. Nevertheless, we emphasized
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> must retain the documents in accordance with the
requirements of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 8</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records Management</ENAMEX>," of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PolicyandProceduresManual</ENAMEX>.
We suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> inform all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> that random
samples of payment transactions would be selected for the purpose
of further verifying the validity of the payments and, for those
selected transactions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> would be required to forward all
related documents to the certifying or payment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s location
for review. We also suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provide travelers
with training to familiarize them with the retention and storage
requirements. We did not object to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> retaining supporting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hardcopy</ENAMEX> documents so long as the suggestions we made were
effectively implemented.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Signatures</ENAMEX>
Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> designing automated employee travel
voucher systems discussed in the previous sections did not indicate
how the data would be secured from unauthorized access and
manipulation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> requested our views on whether the
electronic signatures proposed in their designs provided sufficient
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> to ensure the integrity of the data on the vouchers after
being completed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> and approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
Regarding those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that did not disclose the type of
signature in their proposals, we pointed out that the degree to
which data on electronic vouchers are secured depends upon the type
of automated signature used. Electronic signatures meeting the
criteria previously discussed may be used to secure data on the
voucher when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> electronically sign
the voucher.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/AIMD21.3.2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/00</NUMEX>)
After our responses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Paperwork Elimination Act</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPEA</ENAMEX>) became effective, requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> to issue guidance to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> for using and accepting electronic documents and
signatures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s guidance states that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should determine
whether an electronic signature alternative, in conjunction with
appropriate process controls, represents a practicable tradeoff
between benefits, costs, and risks; and if so, determine and
document which signature alternative is the best <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to use for a
particular application.
Regarding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> requesting our views on the
signatures proposed in their designs, we stated that their
signatures must meet the aforementioned criteria. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
were working with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> (who provided the electronic
applications for the automated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>) in moving
towards meeting the criteria. We did not object to their system
being <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> tested at limited locations so long as they continued
to move toward meeting the criteria. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> agreed to follow
up by requesting our views on full implementation when the
signatures at the pilot locations were implemented.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> planning the implementation of an electronic
travel claim system asked us if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> could be reimbursed on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flatrate</ENAMEX> basis for lodging (the maximum allowed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> where
the travel took place), under the same concept of the per diem rate
allowed for meals and related incidental amounts. The agency
believed that a flatrate would reduce the administrative effort
needed to separately record all actual lodging costs incurred,
retain and submit the receipts when requested, and examine the
lodging costs on the voucher.



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FlatRate Lodging Reimbursement</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO PolicyandProceduresManualdoes</ENAMEX> not address lodging
reimbursement on a flatrate basis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSA</ENAMEX> is responsible for setting
the maximum allowable amount for a particular locality. However, we
provided the requester our views on internal control when
considering the implementation of flatrate lodging policy.
Going to a flatrate lodging basis poses a risk that the
government would incur more cost than it would otherwise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX>
who incur minimal lodging costs by staying at a government
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">facility/</ENAMEX>military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> or low cost lodging would, in many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, receive excessive travel stipends under the proposal,
especially if they stay at a location for an extended period.
We believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should analyze the costs and benefits of
going to a flatrate basis for lodging before a decision is made to
implement it. The



<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Validating Travel Claims After Payment Authorization</ENAMEX>
analysis should include consideration of the costs to process
travel vouchers as well as a review of past travel authorizations
and claims by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> compared to the maximum amounts allowed. If
the difference were minimal, justification would exist for going to
such a rate, providing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSA</ENAMEX> approved. If the difference is material,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should reconsider going to such a rate or establish
procedures to ensure travelers incur at least a significant portion
of the flatrate amount or, if not, are reimbursed at the actual
costs incurred.
Another one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> planning the implementation of an
electronic travel claim system believed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 percent</NUMEX> of
the travel claims would continue to come from small, isolated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> spend most of the time out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>)
where obtaining and operating computer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> are not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">costeffective</ENAMEX>. Travel vouchers for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at those locations were to
continue to be completed and processed in hardcopy paper documents
under a manual system. To reduce the cost of processing such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hardcopy</ENAMEX> documents, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> designed procedures whereby travel
vouchers would be certified for payment prior to the review of
supporting documentation. After completing and signing the voucher,
it would be approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, then forwarded to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">certifying</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>'s location, certified for payment, and payment
made to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>. After payment, a test of the validity of the
payment would be made on a sample basis by obtaining the supporting
documentation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> (where it would be retained) and
reviewing information in the documents to ensure the validity of
the claim. The sampling methodology would follow the sampling
requirements contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> believed that the risks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> from
implementing such a design were minimal based on an analysis it had
performed under its current system. The analysis revealed that very
low error rates were found during its prepayment testing of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vouchers</ENAMEX> and that collecting overpayments from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, by virtue
of their relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, would be easily done.
Nevertheless, to ensure that overpayments were collected, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> would take the most expedient of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> following options
to recover funds: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) obtain reimbursement from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
make deductions from other travel payments due the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
initiate action for payroll deductions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s
salary<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s goal was to
18
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> had provided clearance to the financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> regarding authority to make payroll deductions from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> for overpayment of travel claims.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
recover overpayments, using one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> collection options,
within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX> of discovering the overpayment.

The type of postpayment validation procedures the agency
proposed to implement is analogous to the form of payment known as
"fast pay," available for the purchase of goods and services. In
assessing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s design, we applied the fast pay criteria.
Fast pay is permitted primarily where there is a continuing
relationship with reliable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and a geographical separation
exists between the payment authorization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and the location
where goods and services are received.
We believed the two criteria were met; however, we offered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
suggestions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. First, the sampling plan should be
designed to ensure that the risks of overpayments are within
tolerable thresholds. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should formally
communicate to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who prepare these vouchers the process
for recovering overpayments. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should establish a
mechanism to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who make repeated errors, so their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vouchers</ENAMEX> could receive prepayment validation until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">such time</TIMEX> as the
errors are eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level. Finally,
during the initial period of implementation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> should
emphasize its review of the new process during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s annual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control review under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">FMFIA</ENAMEX>.
We did not object to this portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s new employee
travel system, provided our suggestions were effectively
implemented.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omitting Supervisory Approval of Travel Claims</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> planning the implementation of an electronic travel
claim system designed systems in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>'s approval of
travel vouchers would not be needed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> would rely on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>'s approval of the travel order (i.e., the obligating
document authorizing travel to be taken), the electronic edits, and
the review of supporting documents after payment certification. The
review of supporting documents to fully validate the automated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edits</ENAMEX> would be done on a statistically generated sample from the
universe of all vouchers.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
The primary purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>'s approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>'s
travel vouchers is to help the certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> ensure that all
claims are valid when certified. Generally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>'s
approval serves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main purposes for the certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
to indicate the claims on the voucher are reasonable and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to
verify that the travel actually took place. While the first purpose
would be achieved through the electronic edits proposed in
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/AIMD21.3.2</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/00</NUMEX>)
the design, we were concerned that payment would be authorized
before verifying that the travel actually took place.
We believe there are several alternative procedures available to
verify that travel actually took place without requiring the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>'s approval. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> could be required to
use the agencydesignated charge card for hotel and certain other
costs. When the travel voucher is being processed, the automated
system could compare the information on the actual charges
processed by the charge card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> with those claimed on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">voucher</ENAMEX>. When a "match" occurs for hotel and certain other charges,
a verification of the actual trip would be made. Where no match is
found, the travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (or certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>) could request the
hotel receipts to verify outoftown lodging costs. Properly
implemented, this approach provides reasonable assurance that a
trip occurred.
We did not object to the implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s proposal
so long as procedures were implemented to verify that authorized
trips were actually taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> prior to payment
authorization and that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> the system was

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> intended to implement an employee travel claim
procedure allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, with certain exceptions, to merely
list an aggregate amount of all expenses that individually cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX>
or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less.19</NUMEX> At thetimeof the request, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSA</ENAMEX> required all travel
expenses to be listed on the voucher; however, it granted the
requester a waiver of the requirement to itemize expenses costing
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX> or less as long as we concurred.



Summarizing Expenses of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX> or Less

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO Response</ENAMEX>
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 7</ENAMEX> requires the validity of travel claims to be
established prior to certification for payment, we believe that
listing all expenses individually on the travel voucher helps
satisfy this requirement. Such a list provides the official
administratively approving the voucher (usually the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervisor</ENAMEX>) and the certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> additional evidence for
determining the reasonableness of the claims. It also reduces the
risks of errors or fraud occurring and going undetected.
Our response contained a simple example of an error occurring
that would not be detected if all expenses <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX> or less were merely
listed in the aggregate on the voucher. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>
inadvertently summarized taxi

At the time of our response to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSA</ENAMEX> required the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveler</ENAMEX> to obtain receipts for all expenses individually costing
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX> or more.
fares costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17.99 as $71.99</NUMEX> on the voucher by transposing the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, the approving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> and the certifying
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, who might generally expect much lower taxi fares, would
have no basis to assess the reasonableness of the claim. Both
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> would lose the capability to determine whether claims
under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX> were reasonable under the circumstances.
We suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> modify its proposal to require
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> to list each expense individually on the travel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">voucher</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Financial Management Improvement Program</ENAMEX> (JFMIP) is a
joint cooperative undertaking of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Treasury</ENAMEX>,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Personnel Management</ENAMEX>, working in cooperation with
each other and with operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to improve financial
management practices throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The program was
initiated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of the Budget</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> and
was given statutory authorization in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Procedures Act of 1950</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Service Commission</ENAMEX>, now the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personnel Management</ENAMEX> (OPM), joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFMIP</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Federal Financial Management Improvement Act</ENAMEX> (FFMIA) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
requires, among other things, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> implement and maintain
financial management systems that substantially comply with federal
financial management systems requirements. These system
requirements are detailed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Management Systems</ENAMEX>
Requirements series issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFMIP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management</ENAMEX> and

requirements documents identify (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a framework for financial
management systems, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) core financial systems requirements, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> other financial and mixed systems supporting agency

in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s overall systems architecture.
Systems standards are important for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> streamlining
operations by redesigning or modifying systems to take advantage of
technological advances. The standards provide the criteria to help
ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> include effective internal control and meet
the requirements imposed for central reporting and complying with
laws and regulations.
