(i)
Cost-benefit analysis

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>, in its report to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>, states that it was not
required to prepare and did not prepare a cost-benefit analysis of
the final rule.


(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act, 5 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 603-605, 607</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">609</NUMEX>


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> prepared both an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
and a Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX> in connection with the
proposed rulemaking and the final rule, respectively.
The analyses describe the reason for the rule and the legal
basis for it. They also include descriptions of the number of small
entities affected by the rule; discussions of the recordkeeping,
reporting, and other compliance requirements; and the steps taken
to minimize the burdens on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
The final rule eliminates installment payments in the auction of
the lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Category</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> MHz
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized Mobile Radio</ENAMEX> service. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Balanced Budget Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>
requires that all proceeds from auctions be deposited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 30, 2002</TIMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> points out that
installment payments are not the only tool available to assist
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and that the final rule provides for higher bidding
credits, in lieu of installment payments.
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13570</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> comments and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> reply comments were

The final rule contains a revised information collection
requirement which is subject to approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>). The preamble to the final rule sets
forth the information required by the act, including the need and
use of the information, the estimated number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, and
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> burden <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> imposed.
The information collection is entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Auction Forms and License</ENAMEX>
Transfer Disclosures. The previously approved collection involved
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> and a total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> burden hour estimate of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">773,000</NUMEX> at a cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$46,347,350</NUMEX>. The additional requirements will
not increase the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> but increase the burden
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,500</NUMEX> and the cost by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$612,650</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> has requested emergency approval by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> of the revised
collection by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2, 1998</TIMEX>, and will accept comments on the
