<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cost-Benefit Analysis</ENAMEX>

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> indicated in its submission to us that it was
not required to prepare and did not prepare a cost-benefit analysis
of the rule.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 603</ENAMEX>: Initial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
The preamble to the proposed rule stated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that
would be required to comply with the rule are public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> and
transmitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> that do not fall within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>'s definition of small entity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1 60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">66197-8</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> certified, pursuant to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 605</NUMEX>(b), that the rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and did
not prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66198</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 605</ENAMEX>(b) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that the certification and
explanatory statement shall be provided to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Counsel</ENAMEX> for
Advocacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>). In response to
our inquiry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> explained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> did
not provide a separate certification and statement to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> because
it considers publication of the certification in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register</ENAMEX> to be notice to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> has confirmed that
some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> follow this practice, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> has not objected to
it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 604</ENAMEX>: Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
1Section 601(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>, provides that
the term "small business" generally has "the same meaning as the
term 'small business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>' under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 3</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business</ENAMEX>
Act." <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 3</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Act</ENAMEX> defines a "small business
concern" as a business which is independently owned and operated
and which is not dominant in its field of operation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â</ENAMEX>§
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">632</NUMEX>(a).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-12</NUMEX> In the preamble to the final rule, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
reiterated that the rule would only apply to public and
transmitting utilities and again certified that the rule would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>. See
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21762</NUMEX>. Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> did not conduct a
final regulatory flexibility analysis under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 604</NUMEX>(a). One
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commenter</ENAMEX> expressed concern that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> would extend the
requirement for an open access same-time information system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASIS</ENAMEX>)
to nonpublic, not-for-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cooperative utilities</ENAMEX> and stated that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> would then be required to analyze the requirement's
effect on those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX>. In response, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> emphasized
that the rule would only apply to public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> that own,
operate, or control transmission facilities subject to the
Commission's jurisdiction. See <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21763</NUMEX>. By letter of
May <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> of its certification.
In light of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s determination that the rule would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, sections 605(a) and (c), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">609</NUMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inapplicable</ENAMEX>.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii) Agency Actions Relevant</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sections 202-205</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532-1535</TIMEX>

The rule requires public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> to create or participate in
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASIS</ENAMEX> designed to provide potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> with information
by electronic means about available transmission capacity and
prices. According to the preambles to the proposed and final rules,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> reviewed its proposed information collection and,
among other things, assessed the need for the information, how the
information would be used, and the associated burden. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.

evaluated comments on the proposed information collection. The
Commission specifically solicited public comments on the need for
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of the information; the accuracy of the burden estimate
contained in the preamble to the proposed rule; ways to enhance the
quality, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, and clarity of the information to be collected;
and suggested methods for minimizing the burden. See <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
