Preface
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> assists congressional decisionmakers in their deliberative
process by furnishing analytical information on issues and options
under consideration. Many diverse methodologies are needed to
develop sound and timely answers to the questions that are posed by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. To provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> evaluators with basic information
about the more commonly used methodologies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s policy guidance
includes documents such as methodology transfer papers and
technical guidelines.
This methodology transfer paper on case study evaluations
describes how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> could use case study methods in
performing our work. It describes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> applications of case study
methods, including the purposes and pitfalls of each, and explains
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarities</ENAMEX> and differences among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>. This paper presents an
evaluation perspective on case studies, defines them, and
determines their appropriateness in terms of the type of evaluation
question posed. The original report was authored by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lois</ENAMEX>-ellin
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datta</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1987</TIMEX>. This reissued (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>) version supersedes the
earlier edition.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX> is one of a series of papers issued
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Program Evaluation and Methodology Division</ENAMEX> (PEMD). The
purpose of the series is to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> evaluators with guides to
various aspects of audit and evaluation methodology, to illustrate
applications, and to indicate where more detailed information is
available.
We look forward to receiving comments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of this
paper. They should be addressed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor Chelimsky</ENAMEX> at

Introduction
At his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>-required anti-terrorist training session
recently, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> for a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX> said,
"The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of information were so few and far between that people
weren't even paying attention. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight-hour</TIMEX>
course entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> only to change videotapes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> were
talking; they were doing other things, including reading the
paper." (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Inquirer</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>)
This is a case instance. It is an effective way of drawing
attention to a problem such as training quality. Such anecdotes are
remembered and they are convincing. What they are not, however, is
generalizable: that is, an anecdote doesn't tell whether it is the
only such instance or whether the problem is wide-spread. And
anecdotes usually don't show the reasons for a situation, and thus
are of limited value in suggesting solutions.
The challenge for evaluators is how to use those aspects of an
anecdote that are effective for our work-the immediacy, the
convincingness, the attention-getting quality-and, at the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, fulfill other informational requirements for our jobs, such
as generalizability and reliability. Case study methods, while not
without their limitations in this regard, can help us answer this
challenge.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> already does a lot of case studies-or at least, what we
ourselves call case studies in describing our methods. There are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> case studies in many areas-urban housing, weapon systems
testing, community development, military procurement contracts,
influences on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">export-import balances</ENAMEX>, how programs
aimed at improving water quality are working, and the
implementation of block grants-to name <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few</NUMEX>.
Most of these case studies are either "illustrative" or
"critical" instance applications. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> type of
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
application illustrates findings established by other
techniques, supplementing, for example, national findings on clean
air from administrative records and other sources, with in-depth
description on how funds have been used and with what results in
selected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type of application is in-depth
analysis of a case of unique interest, such as whether funds have
been awarded and managed properly in a specific community health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> or if a certain former government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> had done anything
improper before or after leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. There are,
however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other applications of case studies that are less
often used at present but that could be appropriate for our jobs.
In brief, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> types of case study, which we examine in chapter
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, are as follows:



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illustrative</ENAMEX>. This case study is descriptive in
character

and intended to add realism and in-depth examples to other
information about a program or policy.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Exploratory. This is also a descriptive case study but is
aimed at generating hypotheses for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> investigation rather than
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrating</ENAMEX>.



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Critical instance. This examines a single instance
of

unique interest or serves as a critical test of an assertion
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a program, problem, or strategy.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Program implementation. This case study investigates
operations, often at several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, and often
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normatively</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
Program effects. This application uses the case study to
examine causality and usually involves multisite, multimethod
assessments.


Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Cumulative. This brings together findings from many case
studies to answer an evaluation question, whether descriptive,
normative, or cause-and-effect.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX> is a review of methodological issues
involved in using case study evaluations. It is not a detailed
guide to case study design. It does, however, explain the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarities</ENAMEX> and differences among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> kinds of case study and
discusses ideas for successfully designing them. It also gives
guidance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who, in reviewing completed case studies,
wants to assess their strengths. Finally, it presents an evaluation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> on case studies, defining them and determining their
appropriateness in terms of the type of evaluation question
posed.
The methods and types of case studies outlined here are not
definitive. The case study as a research method has evolved over
many years of experience but evaluative use of the method has been
more limited. Indeed, the history of the case study as an
evaluation method is little older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>. Therefore,
discussion of some of the applications described here is based on
relatively extensive field experience (with questions in such
domains as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX>, education, welfare, environment, housing, and
foreign aid), while the discussion of some of the other
applications is based on more constrained experience.
We have paid particular attention to the conventional wisdom
that case studies are always subjective and nongeneralizable. In
many uses of case studies, there is no need to generalize.
Nonetheless, we find that there are steps that can be taken to
generalize from case studies when this is desired. However, we did
not devote any particular emphasis to the popular idea that case
studies are inexpensive to conduct (issues of research management
common to all
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
designs were outside the scope of our work). However, one thing
that should emerge quite clearly from the discussion of design
features intrinsic to the case study is that it can be a rather
costly endeavor, given the time required, the rich in-depth nature
of the information sought, and the need to achieve credibility.
This reinforces the importance of weighing carefully the decisions
to employ the case study method in program evaluation.
In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we have taken positions on many issues, expecting
to revise these as experience accumulates and as we receive
reactions from evaluators and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is intended
to transfer what we believe to be good practice in case studies and
to help establish the principles of applying case studies to
evaluation. Thus, while the document offers preliminary guidance,
it is also a point of departure. For example, we are developing the
variation that we call the "cumulative" case study. It can entail
prospective and retrospective designs and it permits synthesis of
many individual case studies undertaken at different times and in
different sites.
The quality of case studies can be variable. Some score high on
reasonable tests of quality; others have lower scores. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
problems often encountered have to do with matching the question
the evaluator set out to answer and the method for selecting the
instances examined, reporting the basis for selecting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, and integrating findings across several instances when
the findings in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> were inconsistent with those in another.
The next sections of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> will first present some new ways
of thinking about a familiar method, the case study, and then
introduce the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> applications, describing what is required, in
terms of methodology, to get the benefits case studies can offer.
In the last

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX>, we turn to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic questions: What do we need to take
into account with regard to the objectivity of case studies and
their generalizability?
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>


What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Are Case Studies</ENAMEX>?
Almost everyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> probably has worked on a case study at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time or another yet may be unfamiliar with what is meant,
methodologically, by a case study. The methodological meaning is
important in understanding what differentiates a case study from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noncase</ENAMEX> study and a good case study from a not-so-good case
study.
What is a case study? The exercise in table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> describes a job
we might be asked to do and a design for it and asks you to decide
whether or not this is a case study. Take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10 minutes</TIMEX> to think
through this example and write out your answer. It is important
that you try this out yourself, so please do it before
continuing.

The answers some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> gave may illustrate the range of
definitions surrounding case study methods.
To some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> evaluators, the instance was an application of the
case study method, because we were looking at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or
because we could not generalize or because "actual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are
being used for analysis of a specific question." To some, the
instance was clearly not an application of the case study method,
because "we do not know if the instances are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">universe</ENAMEX>," and "there doesn't appear to be enough done at each
site." To still others, it was not possible to tell whether this
was a case study because looking at instances was what we do in all
our methods, and there was no differentiation between this job and
a compliance audit.
The definitions given also varied greatly. To <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, a case
study involves looking at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. To another, a case
study examines a clearly defined site and reports on that one site,
so that multiple site studies would not be case studies. To
another, case studies involve getting a great deal of information
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a single</NUMEX> site or circumstance, when generalizability isn't
important. To others, "a random sample is necessary for a case
study," "case studies are nonnormative research that investigate a
situation without prejudice," "where we could look at a limited
number of cases that would represent the universe overall," and "a
review of relevant conditions in a specific environment with no
attempt to project to a larger universe." There were almost as many
definitions as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and few of them had elements in common.
While exact uniformity isn't expected or perhaps even possible when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are asked to recall a definition, the extreme variability
illustrates that we could be talking about very different things
in
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>

What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Is Meant by "a Case Study"</ENAMEX>?
a proposal or report when we discuss case study methods. Thus a
decision to "do case studies" could lead to the collection of
irreconcilably dissimilar information from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> working on the
same job.
We have developed a definition of case studies that leads to
appropriate uses and says something about how a good case study is
conducted. It is somewhat technical, so we turn next to giving this
definition and to discussing each of its elements.
"A case study is a method for learning about a complex instance,
based on a comprehensive understanding of that instance obtained by
extensive description and analysis of that instance taken as a
whole and in its context."
For example, if we were asked to study what caused the Three
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mile Island</ENAMEX> disaster and scoped the job to describe whether
required safeguards were complied with, this would not be a case
study. If, however, we scoped the job to examine in depth events
leading up to the disaster, what went wrong, and why it went wrong,
this would be a case study. For a second example, if we were asked
to study the safety of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in general, we might select
as our method a survey of self-reported compliance with safeguards
in all existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. This would not be a case study. If,
however, we scoped the job to examine in depth recent problems in
appropriately selected nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> including among others Three
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mile Island</ENAMEX>, seeking to understand why the safeguards either were
not complied with or were not sufficient, then we would have
selected the case study method to answer the question.
As we will discuss later, several methods can be used in one
job; these examples are only intended to highlight what is not, and
what is, a case study.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
Examining the elements of the definition also may help make this
distinction clear.
"A complex instance" means that input and output cannot be
readily or very accurately related. There are several reasons why
such a relationship might be difficult. There could be many
influences on what is happening and these influences could interact
in nonlinear ways such that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of change in the input can be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with quite different changes in the output, sometimes
increasing it, sometimes decreasing it, and sometimes having no
discernible effect.
Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> gives an example of a less and a more complex
instance. "Are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> following required <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and
international security procedures for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>?" is a less
complex question because the criterion is fairly clear, the focus
is narrow, the influences on compliance are likely to be relatively
few, and the relation of input and output is likely to be fairly
direct. Staff knowledge of procedures ought to play some role in
following these procedures, for instance.
Some questions are more complex, however, such as the question:
"Are security procedures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> sufficient to protect the
safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and equipment?" This is more complex because
the criterion of "sufficient protection" is much less certain; the
focus is broader; the influences on actual achievement of
sufficient procedures are likely to be many; and the relation of
input and output is not only likely to be both direct and indirect
but also difficult to measure.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> key element in our definition is "a comprehensive
understanding." Here the situation is more straightforward. This
means that the goal of a
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
case study is to obtain as complete a picture as possible of
what is going on in an instance, and why.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> key element, "obtained by extensive description and
analysis," has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> components. These are summarized in table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX>.
Case studies involve what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methodologists</ENAMEX> call "thick" descriptions:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX>, full information that should come from multiple data sources,
particularly from firsthand observations. The analysis also is
extensive, and the method compares information from different types
of data sources through a technique called "triangulation." That
is, reliability of the findings is developed through the multiple
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> within each type. This is akin to corroboration as
discussed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Policy Manual</ENAMEX>, chapter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>. The
validity
of the findings, particularly validity with regard to
Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Complexity of Questions Example Characteristic</ENAMEX>
A less complex question
Are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> following required <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and international
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> procedures for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Criterion</ENAMEX> is fairly clear: "required <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and international
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> procedures"
Focus is narrow: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>"
Influences on compliance are likely to be relatively few: staff
knowledge of procedures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> training in their implementation,
functioning equipment, number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> compared to workflow, degree
of supervision, staff screening and selection
Relation of input (influences on compliance) to output (that
required security procedures are followed) is fairly direct

Example Characteristic
A more complex question
Are security procedures in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> sufficient toprotect the safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and
equipment?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Criterion</ENAMEX> is less clear: what would be sufficient under present
conditions and with existing and possible technologies? Focus is
broader: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and equipment (although still fairly well
specified)
Influences on achievement of sufficient procedures likely to be
many, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the art of detection technologies,
number and militancy of potential threats to security, and the
willingness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and airport personnel
to accept different costs and forms of protection
Relation of input (influences on security) and output (safety)
likely to be difficult to measure and to be both indirect and

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, together with the systematic ruling out of
alternative explanations and the explanation of "outlier" results.
Examining consistency of evidence across different types of data
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> is akin to verification. There are specialized strategies
for making these comparisons-namely, pattern matching, explanation
building, and thematic review. The technical how-tos for these
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strategies will be summarized later in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. They
involve techniques such as graphic data displays, tabulations of
event frequencies, and chronological or time series orderings.
Generally, data collection and analysis are concurrent and
interactive-that is, "yoked" in case study methods.
The next element of the definition is "taken as a whole." As
this list indicates, the size of the instance can be as small as
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> or as large as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. The instance as a whole can
be


•
An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand Marcos</ENAMEX>).


•
A site (<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Three Mile Island</ENAMEX>).


•
A function (joint test and evaluation
program1).


•
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (program evaluation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX>).


•
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX>).


•
An event (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> missile crisis1; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger</ENAMEX>
tragedy).


•
A region, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chesapeake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> water
cleanup efforts, democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX>).


•
"Nested" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in a large or complex case study (note
that the instance or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> must be specified and data appropriate to
it collected).


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> case study that examines an individual is
our examination of whether or not a

senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> behaved improperly with regard to influence and
accepting money before and since leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> (U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 11, 1986</TIMEX>). Another example would be
a request to examine in detail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX>' use of funds
intended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for military or civilian purposes for
his personal benefit. At the other extreme, an instance may be as
large as an event, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> missile crisis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allison</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>)
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> flu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neustadt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fineberg</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>), which have
been the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> well-known case studies, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger</ENAMEX>
tragedy. It can be a region (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chesapeake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> water cleanup
programs), a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> (democracy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>), or an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX>). Moreover, it is possible to have questions
that require nested case studies. For example, to answer a question
about how programs to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped children</ENAMEX> are working, we
might select the cases of preschool and elementary programs; we
might further select within preschool programs, those for the
hearing impaired and those for the orthopedically impaired. Each of
these nested studies is treated, in terms of specification of the
unit of study and collection of data appropriate to it, as any
other case study would be.
The last key element of the definition is "and in its context."
Context means all factors that could affect what is happening in an
instance. As an example, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger</ENAMEX> tragedy, inquiry began
with trying to locate the technology that failed as the reason for
the explosion. The righthand booster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rocket</ENAMEX> was identified as the
source of the explosion and, within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rocket</ENAMEX>, technological
attention focused on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">O-</ENAMEX>rings. The inquiry expanded very
quickly, however, from asking what technology failed to an
examination of contextual influences, such as
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>


•
decisionmaking on whether or not to go, in relation to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">O-</ENAMEX>rings;


•
decisionmaking on whether or not to go, in relation to
other components, such as tiles;


•
decisionmaking more generally in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> with regard to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor-astronaut</ENAMEX> relations and
responsibilities;


•
influences on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, such as alleged pressures not to
cancel flights;


•
quality control tradeoffs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> generally and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.


That is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger</ENAMEX> inquiry could be seen as similar to a
case study in some ways. The rapid spread of inquiry from an
examination of the technology to an investigation of decisionmaking
on that flight, to inquiry about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> as it affected the
Challenger disaster generally, is what "taking the context into
account" means. In case study methods, to understand what happened
and why, context always is considered, and it is this consideration
that gives the case study its strength as a way of understanding
cause and effect.



Some Common <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Benefits Expected From Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
Doing a good case study is more than just looking at what is
happening in a few instances. It is a special systematic way of
looking at what is happening, of selecting the instances,
collecting the data, analyzing the information, and reporting the
results.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> features of case study evaluations that merit
special discussion. Each of these features-if carried out-confers
certain benefits in terms of the product. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the features
relate to design, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to data collection, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to analysis, and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to reporting. These features and their benefits are shown in
table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>. For example, with regard to design, information over
time-the longitudinal feature of the
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
design-provides assurance that the final product represents what
is happening and is not registering an atypical situation.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Instance Selection</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Studies</ENAMEX>
These features are the price of admission to the expected
benefits. One frequent question about case study methods is how
rigorously these features have to be followed. Obviously, the more
closely the requirements are followed, the more benefits can be
expected. It is a judgment call as to how much the features can be
compromised before the "case study" becomes a site visit or turns
into a survey. Probably the most critical features are appropriate
instance selection, triangulation, and the search for disproving
evidence. And of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, probably the most critical is
appropriate instance selection.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> general bases for selecting instances:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">convenience</ENAMEX>, purpose, and probability. Each has its function and
can be used to answer certain questions. A good case study will use
a basis for instance selection that is appropriate for the question
to be answered. Using the wrong basis for selecting an instance is
a fatal error in case study designs, as in all designs. Such a case
study is a not-good case study, and it is irredeemably flawed
despite any methodological virtues it may have in terms of data
collection, analysis, and reporting.
Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> summarizes the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> general bases for selecting
instances and the questions each basis can answer. Of particular
interest may be the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> varieties of purposive site selection:
bracketing, best cases, worst cases, cluster, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>,
typical, and special interest.
Instance selection is crucial to generalizability and to
answering the evaluation questions appropriately. Only rarely will
convenience be a sound basis for instance selection; only rarely
will probability sampling be feasible. Thus, instance selection on
the basis of the purpose of the study is the most appropriate
method in many designs.

Representative "In instances chosen to represent important
variations, what is the program like and why<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
Typical "In a typical site, what is happening and why<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
Special interest "In this particular circumstance, what is
happening and why<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
Probability "What is happening in the program as a whole, and
why?"
The match between the question asked and the method of purposive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX> chosen can be tricky. For example, studies that attain
"representativeness" by conducting a few case studies in a rural
setting, a few in a suburban setting, and a few in an urban setting
will produce a report in which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> settings receive more or
less equal weight. If, however, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> or sites
for the program are rural, such "representativeness" may
appropriately capture the range of site experiences
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
but be rather unrepresentative of the program as a whole, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX> will be needed to generalize only to the range of settings and
not to the program as a whole.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aCosts</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> per day, charged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> to funder
(hypothetical data).
bProblem rates include all problems considered under contract as
serious, such as escape, acts of violence by or toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vandalism</ENAMEX> requiring more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> to repair, and suicides. Rates
are number of such instances per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100 days</TIMEX> per year (hypothetical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>).
To illustrate what each variety means, and how it might be
operationalized, consider the information in table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX>. This gives
hypothetical data about a real situation in designing a
study-selecting instances (in
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
this study, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> or locations) for an assessment of the costs
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> of federal detention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> managed by private
contractors under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB Circular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-76</ENAMEX>. There are not many such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>-so the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> represent what we
might actually find in such a study. The following paragraphs
describe what a sample would look like if it were chosen according
to the bases in table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX>.
Convenience If our location were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denver Regional Office</ENAMEX>, a
convenience sample would be sites 8 (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
Samples
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salida</ENAMEX>). That is, ease of collecting data and minimizing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> required would have driven our choice.

were looking at something about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> rather than about
low-problem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. We could do this by selecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
percent), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amarillo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 percent</NUMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
percent).
Worst <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cases Sites 5</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> problems) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clearwater</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX>) stand out as worst cases. Selecting an
out-of-state comparison, if we wanted it, is harder here. The next
highest problem rate (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salida</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 percent</NUMEX>) is run by a
different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and costs much less. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> has a site in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, which costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-percent
problem rate. The costs of site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>) are higher,
but this site serves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and has a low problem rate. The best
choice probably is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>): it serves the same group
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>) and is run by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>).
Cluster We might be interested in administrative
arrangements-in, for example, how administration works out when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>
alone is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX>, when responsibility is shared with another
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Prisons</ENAMEX>), and when responsibility is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. One cluster of sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3, 8, 9</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>) is administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> alone. Another cluster (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) is shared between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>, and the last cluster (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7,</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8, 12</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>) is run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. We could pick one or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> from each cluster to get a sense of how agency auspices
may affect program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Representative One</ENAMEX> issue we might need to examine could be
efficiencies of operation-particularly in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> size.
Here we might select numbers 1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> beds), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clearwater</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> beds), and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> beds). All are run by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAIM</ENAMEX>, and all serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>. We would have to limit our
generalizations to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, but
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> should give a good sense of the size and
operations issue.
Typical This would be a challenge. In terms of size, there is a
"typical" bed size (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 beds</ENAMEX>); in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> served, there is
a "typical" population (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>); and in terms of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of
operation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years</TIMEX> is "typical," with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 years</TIMEX> a close runner-up. In
terms of costs, however, the distribution is trimodal-that is,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> values appear about equally often-and for percent of
problems, it is almost flat with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> outliers. Also, there is not a
single site that matches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> "typical" characteristics well.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>, for example, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> beds and serves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, but it
has been in operation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 1 year</TIMEX>, costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> per day,
and has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-percent problem rate. The best approach would be to
indicate that it is not possible to pick one site that is "typical"
of such distributions.
Special Interest Any one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> might be examined as a
result of special congressional interest. Such interest usually
would be based on information extraneous to the data in the table:
a complaint might be received, for example, about conditions in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> site, or allegations might be made that the high costs of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> site were due to mismanagement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Probability Samples Probabilistic</ENAMEX> sampling is the method of
choice for answering questions about "how much," or how extensive a
problem is in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Properly carried out, it provides
strong generalizability and assurance of representativeness. A
probability sample is one in which all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the population
have a known and equal chance of being selected. If we used a table
of random numbers, and selected as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sites those
corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1 and 16</TIMEX> in the
table, we would have selected a probability sample. Each site
would
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-in-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> chance of selection, and that chance would be
equal among <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. A fair objection to this statement is that the
laws of probability operate on large numbers, and selecting fewer
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> instances does not always provide the generalizability to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as a whole that probability samples promise.
However, in terms of actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, which we want to illustrate
here, the method just sketched is a probabilistic one, and some
case studies have involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> or more sites selected on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">probabilistic</ENAMEX> basis. (See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEMD</ENAMEX>'s transfer paper entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Using</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Sampling</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General</ENAMEX>
Accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 15, 1986</TIMEX>) for more information.)
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who want to check out their skills in applying
different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purposive</ENAMEX> selection, appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">II</ENAMEX> gives
information for a job involving the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (a fairly common
situation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>), a form for indicating which you would select
for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purposive</ENAMEX> selection, and our
answers, for comparison against yours.
In many jobs, what is a "case" and what dimensions are important
to consider in selection will be clear. For example, the population
of detention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> contracts can be defined
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">legally</ENAMEX> (by the contract awarded), and the relevant dimensions
(length of time in operation, facility size, detainee mix) are
straightforward. There are, however, more problematic
circumstances. An example would be a study of the extent to which
voluntary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have taken up any slack in welfare
supports. What is a voluntary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> can be defined broadly,
as "any nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>," or narrowly, as "a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">service-oriented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> do not receive payment for
their work."
Dimensions of potential relevance for the outcome of interest
are many, and the empirical basis for selecting any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dimension
over others few. In such situations, the evaluator can turn to past
experience, a search of the appropriate theoretical as well as
empirical literature, the advice of knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, an
examination of key issues in proposed or pending legislation,
customer guidance, and similar techniques. That is, while it is
important to recognize the difficulties, there are ways of dealing
with them in case definition.

Case Study Applications
As noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> types of applications for case
study methods-illustrative, exploratory, critical instance,
implementation, program effects, and cumulative. But case study
reports commonly use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> applications: illustrative
and critical instance. Greater use could be made of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> others
in selecting alternative ways of answering questions, because these
may be able to give information that is more valuable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>
than other techniques. Also, improvements can always be made in how
even the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches already used frequently are carried out,
especially in the area of selecting instances for study. The next
sections summarize, for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> types, the evaluation
questions they can answer, the functions they perform, their design
features, and their pitfalls. The last section shows what basis for
selecting sites is appropriate for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
applications.
As table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> indicates, illustrative case studies

Illustrative
primarily describe what is happening and why, in one or two
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, to show what a situation is like. This can help in the
interpretation of other data, particularly if we have reason to
believe most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> know too little about a program or situation
to understand fully the information from surveys or other
methods.

Design features
Site selected as typical or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of important
variations; small number of cases to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s interest; data
often include visual evidence; analysis concerned with data quality
and meaning; and reports use self-contained, separate narratives or
descriptions
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitfalls May</ENAMEX> be difficult to hold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s interest while
presenting in-depth information on each illustration; may not
adequately represent situations where considerable diversity exists
(in such situations, it may be impossible to represent variety well
enough to use illustrative case studies); and may not have time
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">on-site for in</ENAMEX>- depth examination
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has many examples of such illustrative use. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, for
instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CED</ENAMEX> examined housing block grants through a survey
supplemented by case studies. The results of the survey were
published in the main report (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 13, 1982</TIMEX>). For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>), individual reports described what each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was like
with regard to housing and housing-related activities and how the
money was
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
used in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and included before-and-after pictures of what
rehabilitation meant for individual neighborhoods and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> (U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 24, 1982</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 30, 1982</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 1982</TIMEX>). In a similar application, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRD</ENAMEX> described the projects
funded under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Emergency Job Appropriations Act of 1983</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 26, 1985</TIMEX>;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 27, 1985</TIMEX>;
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 25, 1985</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 6, 1985</TIMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illustrative</ENAMEX> case studies are used by evaluators in other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> was
trying out delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> Start services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
in their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Home Start</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> supplemented
a formal assessment of the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> before and
after the program with case studies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High/Scope Educational</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research Foundation</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>). These case studies described what
services were delivered, the conditions in rural as well as urban
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>, and what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Start</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> did during the home visits
and generally provided a surrogate or vicarious experience for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> who might never have visited a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Head Start or a Home Start</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. The case studies told, too, of the development of the
program over time and helped give a realistic sense of problems in
start-up and implementation, how changes in staffing were
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accommodated</ENAMEX>, and the impact of shifting federal guidance on
efforts to carry out the program in the field.
Case studies such as these are well accepted as a valid way of
amplifying a more systematic presentation via the realism and
vividness of anecdotal information. There are, however, pitfalls in
presenting illustrative case studies. The most serious is selecting
the instances. The case or cases must
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
adequately represent the situation or program. This is
relatively easy if the program is small and homogeneous. Where
considerable diversity exists, it may not be possible to select a
"typical" site, and the diversity may be so great that to represent
it adequately would require more case studies than most people
would want to read for illustrative purposes. In the example of
privately operated detention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, an illustrative case study
might run the risk of oversimplifying a more complex situation. The
example was contrived to illustrate exactly this point: that
sometimes we cannot select a site that fits our needs and thus the
method is not appropriate.
However, in many real-world situations, it is possible to
represent diversity adequately for illustrative purposes and to
obtain the benefits of this application: helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> feel,
hear, see, "be there" when this kind of surrogate site experience
is necessary to undo stereotypes or explain a situation otherwise
inaccessible for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Such a situation might be a bilingual education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, about
which stereotypes can abound, or life aboard a
nuclear<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-weapon</ENAMEX>-equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX>, a situation few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> will
ever experience themselves but may need to get a feel for in order
to understand staff selection, training, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> on modern
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">submarines</ENAMEX>.
The exploratory case study is a shortened case study,
Exploratory undertaken before launching into a large-scale
investigation. Its function is to develop the evaluation questions,
measures, designs, and analytic strategy for the bigger study. As
table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX> indicates, it is most helpful where considerable
uncertainty exists about program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, goals, and results.
Also rather than initiate a job requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> staff <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> or
more,
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
when we do not have an adequate on-the-shelf set of designs and
measures, an exploratory case study can save time and money in
implementation as well as improving the confidence we have in our
results. We can aim more precisely and hit the target more
often.

Functions Where considerable uncertainty exists about program
operations, goals, and results, exploratory case studies help
identify questions, select important measurement constructs,
develop actual measures for these, which can be used later in
larger-scale tests; formulate expectations; safeguard investment in
larger studies (for problems or programs that are not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-developed</ENAMEX>)
Design features
Site selected: needs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> site that represents each
important variation to make a convenience sample acceptable; number
of cases sufficient to cover diversity; data focus on program
operations and on-site observation, are not longitudinal but need
enough time to find out what is going on; analysis is closely
concurrent with field work but does not require strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of
evidence or audit trail; reports are usually internal or parts of
larger, longer reports
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitfalls Temptation</ENAMEX> to prolong the exploratory phase; site
selection only for convenience, inadequate coverage of diversity;
prematurity -exploratory findings released as conclusions;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-involvement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">evaluator</TIMEX>'s own hunches so that initial
findings are confirmed rather than tested
Some of our scoping work already may involve exploratory case
studies. For example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGD</ENAMEX>, a design study was done as a separate
job, culminating
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
in a briefing, prior to an in-depth study of the implementation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bail Reform Act of 1984</ENAMEX>. The methodology included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
interviews, observations, and data analysis from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court districts</ENAMEX> selected purposively for their characteristics
on significant variables. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in the field were
also interviewed. An expert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> was used to give feedback at
various points to make sure we had a comprehensive picture of the
situation. The product of this exploratory case study was a
briefing, with the study design choices described, including
detailed research questions, outlines of data sources, significant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, extant data bases, and site selection criteria. From
this, a larger study was designed to meet the needs of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">requester</ENAMEX>. Other jobs may involve similar efforts that are not,
however, reported as separate jobs and thus are less visible as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exploratory</ENAMEX> case studies.
Also reports that include some features of exploratory case
studies have been issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, for example, NSIAD
examined emerging issues in export competition through a case study
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> market (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 1985</TIMEX>). Combining site visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, interviews with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
and from the private sector, examination of official government
files, and a questionnaire survey of high technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> active
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> market, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> amassed a rich array of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contextual</ENAMEX> and focal information and identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> trade
practices considered to be key factors in export competitiveness in
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> markets. These were bilateral trade accords,
countertrade, export financing, and compliance with trade-related
industrial policy. Although to meet the requirements of the job,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSIAD</ENAMEX> did not need to test these factors for generalizability to
other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> through a later
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
study, the product would permit such testing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSIAD</ENAMEX> is using the
findings in this way, as part of its ongoing work on bilateral
initiatives. Of particular methodological note in this report is
the detailed explanation of why export competitiveness in Brazilian
markets (the instance) was selected for the case study.
The exploratory case study has been used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX>, for example, supported an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exploratory</ENAMEX> case study of the career criminal program (Chelimsky
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dahmann</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>). The career criminal program aimed at "swift and
certain" justice by trying to expedite and strengthen processing of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who had long criminal histories at the time of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apprehension</ENAMEX>. The exploratory study looked in depth at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine</TIMEX> demonstration sites prior to conducting a program effects
evaluation. The evaluators identified the key elements of the
programs as implemented and what measurable changes were likely to
occur and developed measures of the outcomes, as well as designs
for testing cause and effect in the subsequent larger study
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chelimsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sasfy</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>).
The greatest pitfall in the exploratory study is prematurity:
that is, the findings may seem so convincing that it can be
difficult to resist pressures to report on these as if they had the
strength of the larger study. Also, care must be taken to scope and
sequence the exploratory study so that it yields enough information
to be worthwhile and in time for use in the larger study but does
not unduly delay answering the questions through the larger study.
In addition, it is inappropriate to use the scoping phase as an ad
hoc exploratory case study accompanied by an urge to issue the
product at the end of scoping, when the necessary procedures for an
exploratory
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
case study with regard to such issues as instance selection have
not been followed.
The critical instance is the most frequent application


Critical Instance
of the case study method in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, so much so that it may be seen
as a "usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> review" rather than recognized as what it can be-a
case study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 22, 1981</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 1982</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 30, 1985</TIMEX>). The advantage of recognizing the
approach as an application of case study methods is that some
aspects of the method-such as the close yoking of data collection
and analysis-that may not be widely used now could be applied in a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> that increases timeliness without reducing quality. (This
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX>, discussed in more detail in the section on analysis, can
increase efficiency by reducing collection of data and large-scale
analyses of these data that subsequently do not prove useful.)
The critical instance case study examines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, or very few,
sites for one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> purposes. First, a very frequent application
is the examination of a situation of unique interest, such as Three
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mile Island</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger</ENAMEX> disaster, or allegations concerning
funding for a specific presidential campaign. There is little or no
interest in generalizability. The instance is not "selected" by us;
rather, we are called to it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> conducts many critical instance studies. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example,
already mentioned, was our review of the representation of foreign
interests by former very high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General</ENAMEX>
Accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 11, 1986</TIMEX>). Another is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEMD</ENAMEX>'s review of the
readiness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Eye Bomb</ENAMEX> for production
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 23, 1986</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yetanother</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCED</ENAMEX>'s review of a construction contract award at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jean Lafitte</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Historical Park</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 1987</TIMEX>) and
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
their examination in a separate report of the park service
actions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Water Gap National Recreation</ENAMEX> area in awarding
a lease, closing a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp ground</ENAMEX>, and raising a house rent (U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 28, 1987</TIMEX>).
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, rare, application is where a highly generalized or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> assertion is being called into question, and we are able
to test it through examining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance.
In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGD</ENAMEX> examined whether national policies,
procedures, and practices with regard to cargo imports were causing
problems in port <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1986</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port of New York</ENAMEX> offered a critical test
because, given the diversity of imports and the volume of work, if
problems were occurring, they would be likely to show up clearly in
this site. If no problems were observed, problems in other sites
were unlikely. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GGD</ENAMEX> used observations, interviews, and document
analysis at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port of New York</ENAMEX> and supplemented
these with a small number of less intensive observations at other
sites. The method, in this instance, was sufficient to permit
recommendations that were systemwide and generalizable with the
single case.
Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX> summarizes the features of the critical instance case
study. As noted, the method is particularly suited for answering
cause-and-effect questions about the instance of concern. It
provides assurance that we have not prematurely overlooked
important factors, that we have not been swayed by information from
limited or perhaps biased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, and that we have taken context
into account, thus giving a fair and balanced picture of the
situation.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
Perhaps the biggest pitfall in this application is insufficient
specification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>'s question. That is, the job may be
presented to us as if only that situation is of concern, but the
underlying question may call for a broader look at the issue. A
request to investigate the reasons for the bank failures in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>,
for example, may reflect an interest only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, but it could be
a "tip of the iceberg" question. What the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> may really want
to know is whether other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are likely to have similar
problems. In such a situation, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> might be selected as a site to
examine but we would also need to look at other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or use other
approaches to achieve the generalizability needed. This then rules
out the critical instance method as appropriate for this job. The
importance of probing the underlying questions in a request to
achieve good specification of the evaluation question is not
unique, of course, to the critical instance case study but it is
crucial in its appropriate application.

We frequently are asked whether a program has been implemented
and, often, whether implementation is in compliance with
congressional intent. The program implementation case study is
helpful where enabling legislation offers considerable flexibility.
In such cases, a wide variety of expenditures or actions could be
consistent with legislation and compliance with
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
Design features
Site selects itself in specific problem-for decisive testing,
have to assume uniform system with regard to issue and so
convenience sample acceptable; number of cases is usually one
instance; comprehensive data for specific problem-for decisive
testing, need more modeling, hypotheses, and targeting to know what
to study; data analysis and collection concurrent and interactive:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> feed new collection, and emphasis on ruling out alternative
causes; report describes instances, presents conclusions about
cause, gives evidence
Pitfalls
Inappropriate selection of this technique as real issue may not
be specific problem (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> bank failure) but more general
questions; premature closure may narrow causal search too early;
overgeneralization from evidence


Program Implementation
intent may be a matter of understanding the process by which
decisions were made, who was involved, and whether the actions are
meeting local needs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> legislation
consolidating many small categorical grants into larger block
grants, the funds for which could be spent very flexibly.
Another situation where program implementation case studies may
be called for is when concern exists about implementation problems.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">In-depth</ENAMEX>, longitudinal reports of what has happened over time and
why can set a context for interpreting a finding of implementation
variability: that is, whether there seem to be basic structural
problems or if the program understandably requires time for
installment, adaptations, and building an infrastructure.
In some instances, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has been able to follow fairly
intensively the implementation of programs or activities. One
example is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGD</ENAMEX>'s series of reports on how the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> census was
conducted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> evaluators, in addition to being "on the scene" due
to their location at the major audit site accompanied enumerators
into the field and examined, in depth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX> procedures at field
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. In other instances, we have spent somewhat less elapsed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in the field, with less direct observation, and with greater
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliance</ENAMEX> on interview and documentary evidence. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, for
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCED</ENAMEX> was asked how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Interior</ENAMEX> was
implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-76</ENAMEX>,
dealing with privatization of all appropriate services. The request
overlapped with another similar request. This request reflected a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX>'s special interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glacier National Park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>.
The evaluators were able to combine the jobs in a review that
eventually involved information from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park Service</ENAMEX>
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">402</NUMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The report aggregates
findings across these
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
sites and concludes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have been slow to implement
the circular, although progress has been made since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> (U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 15, 1985</TIMEX>).
Another example is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s review of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' efforts
to implement the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Managers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Financial Integrity Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>.
A series of case studies, together with an overview report, was
produced. Among these, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCED</ENAMEX>'s review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Commerce</ENAMEX>
implementation, to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> report, examined the actions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>
took that were intended to improve internal controls, such as
training senior financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> in evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX> in the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDA</ENAMEX> business loan program and overhauling
the way in which computer resources were used for the National
Weather Service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCED</ENAMEX> also examined the results of these efforts
and highlighted priority areas for further improvement, such as
better information on results for internal management purposes.
Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> summarizes the design, data collection, analysis, and
reporting features of program implementation case studies. Usually,
in such studies, generalization is wanted and care is required to
negotiate the question with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> (best situations? worst?
typical?) and to match instance selection carefully with the
questions. Unless the program is small and homogeneous, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evaluator</ENAMEX> faces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possibilities. The first possibility is that
the number of instances will need to be fairly large in order to
achieve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generalizability</ENAMEX> wanted, and, as a consequence, skill
will be needed to manage data collection with sufficient
flexibility to obtain the insights case studies offer and
sufficient structure to permit cross-site aggregation of findings.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> possibility is that the diversity will be so great that
it would be impossible to have enough instances to

meet needs for generalizability and still manage the data
collection and analysis.

Design features
Site selection cannot be convenience because usually
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">generalization</ENAMEX> wanted, and purposive sample can be typical and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of diversity and best and worst cases; number of
cases depends on program diversity since generalization usually
wanted; data rely on common instruments, published documents, and
observation; reports are varied in theme, site, chronology, and
narration
Pitfalls
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bias</ENAMEX> detection methods may be inadequate; may fail to take into
account diverse views about program goals and purposes; competence
of all on-site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> may not be sufficiently high; can be
costly due to study size; the demands of data management, data
quality control, validation procedures, and analytic model (within
site, cross site, etc.) may lead to cutting too many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX> to
maintain quality
An important requirement for good program implementation case
studies is investment of enough time on site to get longitudinal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> and to obtain
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
breadth of information. If the purpose is to report what is
happening in a descriptive sense only, short site visits together
with administrative records may provide adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> for
findings. If, however, the evaluation question requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to
report on how satisfactory progress is or the reasons for problems
in implementation, the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who can be on site over time,
with the richest or "thickest" base for examining the situation as
the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved see it, the sounder our causal conclusions
and subsequent recommendations will be.
The multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> usually required for program implementation
questions impose demands on training and supervision needed for
quality control. Because of tight resources, lack of travel funds,
and the need to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with uneven experience and skills, this
becomes critical in situations involving many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> working in
different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. That is, time is needed to train staff
adequately in such case study techniques as the note-taking
required for thick descriptions, which is in turn required for the
content analysis of themes in the instance. It is possible, for
example, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> to interview the same informant and find
that one has used a one-sentence summary for a detailed, rich,
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-minute</TIMEX> discourse while the other captured much more of the
complexity and essence of what was said and what was happening.
Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> illustrates such a difference.
Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Illustration of Differences in Note</ENAMEX>-Taking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Situation Technique Characteristic</ENAMEX>
In an interview with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rich</ENAMEX> notes "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Director</ENAMEX>
indicated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Science Foundation</ENAMEX> procedures had
changed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> program for grants to small times since the inception
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>, the following question is program. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, asked: "How does your program announcements were mailed to
the inform the eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> named as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in the opportunity to apply for grants?" listing, for the
same year, of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Association of Small</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Colleges</ENAMEX>. Because applications were
very sparse, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30%</NUMEX> of
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> applying, the
procedure was changed to a
two-stage mailing, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to find out the name of the
official in charge of federal programs
and then to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>. This worked
well for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5-year</TIMEX> period, in terms of
receipt of applications from over
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX>, but
when overall federal funding for
research was reduced, the positions
of federal program coordinators
were abolished and applications fell
to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40%</NUMEX> of eligible institutions
responding. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years ago</TIMEX>, the
decision was made to mail copies to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> listed as chairs of the
relevant science <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> in
appropriate professional association
listings. This has increased the cost
of outreach by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $15,000</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 25%</NUMEX> more than the prior
system. To date, returns are at the
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> rate again."
Thin notes "The current system is to mail copies of the
announcements to the chairs of relevant science <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, such
as chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science."


Program Effects
Case studies can determine the effects of programs and reasons
for success (or failures). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCED</ENAMEX> examined the
progress made since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970</TIMEX>'s in cleaning up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s air,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and land, finding that while strides had been made toward
meeting the established goals (cleaner air, properly treated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wastewater</ENAMEX>, more drinkable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>), deadlines had been extended and
unresolved issues made meeting even these deadlines difficult (U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 21, 1982</TIMEX>). We pointed to lack of
flexibility as a source of cascading problems and delays. The bases
for these conclusions were in-depth case studies of three sites
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>) together with information
from reports prepared by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and by environmental
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and public interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and interviews with
Environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protection Agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. Particularly notable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methodologically</ENAMEX> in this report is the integration of case study
findings with other sources of information throughout the first
volume.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEMD</ENAMEX> report has focused on water quality: the effectiveness of
efforts to improve water quality and the reasons for successes and
failures. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">In-depth</ENAMEX>, very extensive case studies of several water
catchment areas were conducted, and the final report is based on a
synthesis of the findings from the case studies-another example of
integration of findings across diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General</ENAMEX>
Accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 17, 1986a</TIMEX>, b; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 19, 1986</TIMEX>). This
series of reports also is useful for illustrating the way in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causality</ENAMEX> is established in case studies: through development of
internally consistent explanations of what led to what and the
conscientious use of information from within the site and from
contrasting sites to rule out alternative explanations.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
For another example, to determine whether actions taken by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970</TIMEX>'s to address medical malpractice
insurance reduced insurance costs, the number of claims filed, and
the average amount paid per claim, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRD</ENAMEX> conducted case studies in
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>). Work included obtaining views of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> on perceived problems, actions taken to deal with them,
results of these actions, and the need for federal involvement.
Other information came from surveys of nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> about
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, coverage limits, and costs and claims from leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and, for comparison, the same type of
information from a nationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. The results are presented
separately in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> case study reports and aggregated in the overall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 1986</TIMEX>).
Other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have used the case study method
successfully in answering program effects questions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Foundation</ENAMEX>, for example, assessed the effectiveness of a
cooperative science program aimed at increasing innovation and
knowledge transfer between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> and industry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
case studies were undertaken of a carefully selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> that ranged from computer language systems through nuclear
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> to fisheries biology and chemical engineering. Of note is
the methodological detail given on project selection, data
collection, analysis, and case format. In a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> report,
results from a survey of grant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> are analyzed, giving both
a quantitative and a qualitative sense of how the program was
working. Results from the two methods were not integrated; both
suggested, however, that the program was generally working well
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Science Foundation</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>).

Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX> summarizes key features of program effects case
studies. Like the program implementation case study, the evaluative
question often requires generalizability and, for a highly diverse
program, it may not be possible to answer the questions adequately
and still have a manageable number of sites.

Design features Site selection depends on program diversity,
cannot be used with highly diverse programs; best, worst,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>, typical, or cluster bases appropriate; must keep
number of cases manageable or risk becoming minisurvey, can use
survey before or after to check generalizability or mix survey with
concurrent case studies selected for special purposes; data rely on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> and structured materials, often combine qualitative and
quantitative data; analysis uses varying degrees of formalization
around emergent or predetermined themes; reports are usually
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thematic</ENAMEX> and describe site differences and explain these; variation
in degree of integration of data across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and of findings from
different methods
Pitfalls Not collecting the right amount of data; not examining
the right number of sites; insufficient supply of well-trained
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evaluators</ENAMEX>; difficulties in giving evaluators enough data
collection latitude to obtaining insight without risking bias
There are some methodological solutions to this problem. One
solution would be to conduct the case studies <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in a set of
sites chosen for representativeness and to verify the findings from
the case study through targeted examination of
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
administrative data, prior reports, or a survey. A second
solution would be to use these other methods <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. After
identifying the findings of particular interest, case studies would
be conducted in sites selected to maximize the ability to get the
specific understanding required. Both of these approaches have been
used with good effect in program evaluation.
This relatively new and not as yet widely used



Cumulative
application of case study methods brings together the findings
from case studies done at different times. The applications
previously discussed that involved multisite case studies are
cross-sectional: that is, information from several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is
collected at the same time. In contrast, the cumulative case study
aggregates information from several sites collected at different
and even quite extended times.
The cumulative case study can be retrospective, aggregating
information across studies done in the past, or prospective,
structuring a series of investigations for different times in the
future. The techniques for ensuring sufficient comparability and
quality and for aggregating the information are what constitute the
"cumulative" part of the methodology.
That is, the cumulative case study is similar to an evaluation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, in that it is a method for aggregating the findings of
several studies. It differs from an evaluation synthesis in that
special techniques are required to aggregate the qualitative
information that often is a feature of case studies and to maintain
the sense of the "instance as a whole" in its complexity that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distinguishes</ENAMEX> case studies from surveys of several sites. For some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jobs</ENAMEX>, both case study and noncase study reports can be
aggregated,
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
each using the appropriate techniques, in order to produce
capping reports or similar products.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> does not appear to have done a cumulative case study using
our own case study reports or other case studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reports have
been used with good results, however, in cumulative case studies
published by others outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is a book on
bureaucratic failures, which is based entirely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reports of
management problems in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> over a considerable
period of time (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> began with a set of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hunches</ENAMEX> or hypotheses about what can go wrong in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>,
and what would be evidence supporting-or contradicting-these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotheses</ENAMEX>. He reviewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reports in detail, analyzed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in terms of his framework, and aggregated the
results in his final chapter.
Other examples of cumulative case studies come from two
international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. A retrospective cumulative case study was
conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> in its examination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> in-depth
case studies of the effectiveness of educational programs. These
case studies were intended initially as stand-alone assessments of
the programs but were brought together to learn about the
effectiveness of the evaluations themselves in the context of
educational programs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Searle</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>). A prospective cumulative case
study was commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Agency for International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX>. The purpose was to identify input and process
components of economic assistance that could be quantitatively
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with differences in outcome measures. The method was the
specification of a common set of data (both qualitative and
quantitative) to be collected over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5-year</TIMEX> period as projects were
initiated, together with a means of coding the data across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
studies eventually completed. The coded results were
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
analyzed quantitatively in the final report (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finsterbush</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>).

Aspect examined Characteristic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitfalls Publication</ENAMEX> basis may severely limit generalization;
inadequate or uncertain quality of original data; quality of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>-reduction procedures may be very difficult to determine; the
effects of changes in many contextual factors over time may be
difficult to separate from effects of the programs
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> features of the cumulative case study, shown in table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX>,
are the case survey method just described as a means of aggregating
findings (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heald</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yin et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>) and
backfill techniques (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>). The latter are helpful in
retrospective cumulation as a means of obtaining information from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> that permits an otherwise unusable case study to be
included in the aggregation. Knowing the basis on which the case
instances were selected, for example, is crucial in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cumulation</TIMEX>;
otherwise it is not possible to know whether best case, worst case,
typical, or the like instances are being aggregated. Some published
case studies do not provide sufficient detail on this. In
backfilling, the evaluator might call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, visit the author
to review the original data, or contact others who were
knowledgeable about the design decisions in order to get adequate
information on instance selection.
Opinion varies as to the credibility of cumulative case studies
for answering program implementation and effects questions. One
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> notes that publication biases may favor programs that
seem to work, which could lead to a misleadingly positive view
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>). Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> are concerned about the quality
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
of the original data and analyses and problems in verifying
their quality (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoaglin et al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>). For the cumulative
use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reports, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> are less important, since we
already use the "audit trail" procedures recommended in the policy
and other manuals for verification of data collection and analysis
quality. We do, however, have the opposite concern: that is, we
would need to be sure there was not "bad news" selectivity in a
particular area, associated with killing jobs that did not identify
problems during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">scoping</TIMEX>.




<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design Decisions and Case Study Applications</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> sections, we discussed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> for purposive
selection of instances and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> applications of the case study
method, each of which was associated with a different evaluation
purpose or question. Bringing this information together, table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX>
shows the relations among case study applications and design
decisions. For example, if the purpose of the study is
illustrative, an appropriate basis for site selection could be
typical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>, or cluster; the case studies would be
conducted concurrently with other methods used in the main study;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prestructuring</ENAMEX> or guidance to the evaluators in the field would be
low to moderate to permit the thickness and richness of insights
needed; data could be qualitative only or both qualitative and
quantitative; the case studies probably would be analyzed within
sites only; and the reporting would probably be narrative.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Collection and Analysis</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Collection</ENAMEX>
We have said that the features distinguishing case studies from
other methods are how sites are selected, how the data are
collected, and how they are analyzed. In the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, we
covered instance selection. We turn now to other elements that
distinguish a case study from a not-case study and a good case
study from a not-good case study. The discussion is an introduction
to the approaches.
In other transfer papers on program evaluation, we have
emphasized the importance of validity. Validity involves
measurement and also design. A valid measure-that is, one with
construct validity-reflects what it claims to reflect and not
something else. For example, whether or not there are active
opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> may be a more valid measure of whether a country
is a democracy than how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> vote in an election. A valid
cause-and-effect design-that is, one with internal validity-rules
out alternative explanations of results by comparing what happened
with an intervention to what happened in the absence of the
intervention. For example, in a study of the effects of an
employment training program, greater employment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
after the training than before must be shown to be due to the
training and not simply to better economic conditions, which also
could increase employment.
Measurement Case study methods can use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tactics for achieving
measurement validity: multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of evidence

and using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-of-evidence technique in data reduction.

used-sometimes all of them in the same study-to collect information
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neustadt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fineberg</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yin</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>).

Many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> techniques are discussed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Policy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manual</ENAMEX>, chapter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX>. Of these ways, the approaches that most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">differentiate</ENAMEX> case studies from other techniques are direct
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> observation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has used both approaches in its jobs. For example, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSIAD</ENAMEX>'s study of conditions on submarines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> spent time
aboard submarines in a variety of situations, getting firsthand
knowledge of life in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>. Their direct observations form
the primary data source for our report. We went to sea in this
instance, however, in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> role, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and evaluators and
so-it could be argued-might have seen what special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> see and
not what life would be like for the average sailor.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
To get more authentic information, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> have sometimes
become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in situations, not identified to the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> involved as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example of how we have adapted
this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant-observer</ENAMEX> approach was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGD</ENAMEX>'s study of the
services available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> reduced the
number of public information agents
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 5, 1984</TIMEX>). Wedeveloped a
set of standard income tax questions about which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> typically
would call <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, obtained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> agreement on the correct answers to
these questions, and then, on a probabilistic sampling basis,
called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to seek help. We used names
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald A. Office</ENAMEX> in these conversations but did not say we
were from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. We were able to report how long it took to get the
phone answered, how long it took to get information, the
consistency of information, and general helpfulness of the
responding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Such an approach gave more authentic information
than relying only on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> records of calls received, or a survey of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> would have no record of time
before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> could get through to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and of "discouraged
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX>." In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, a survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> would have to be
very large to get a good "hit" rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who sought
assistance, and the diversity of individual questions would have
blurred ability to interpret variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> responsiveness. HRD
used a similar approach in reviewing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
Administration's telephone inquiry program; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 4,000</NUMEX> calls were
made, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> taking the role of ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in
asking the randomly selected, prepared questions (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General</ENAMEX>
Accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 29, 1986</TIMEX>).
One element of data collection that distinguishes case studies
from other techniques is that comprehensiveness of interviewing is
very important.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
In order to learn the meaning of events to those involved in
them, a key element of case studies, the views of more senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are not given greater weight than views of less highly
placed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. In fact, a case study where the only people
interviewed were senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> would be seen as a not-good case
study, in contrast to one where the views of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> at all
levels affected was obtained.
For example, if we wanted to learn about how noncompetitive
awards were reviewed in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, a good case study would obtain
information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> head, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the procurement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector general</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, the contracts officer
responsible for selected awards, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> involved in the reviews for
these awards, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart persons</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>' procurement
and program operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and the legal divisions within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>. We might shadow several noncompetitive
procurements, following their life history from initiation through
actual awards, sitting in on meetings, and studying, over time, how
the awards were handled.
Chain of Evidence A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of evidence is the sequence from
observation to conclusions. In a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of evidence, an
independent <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> evaluator could follow the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> evaluator from
original observations, the "raw" or unreduced data, through all the
steps of data aggregation and analysis, and conclude that the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evaluator</ENAMEX>'s findings were justified by the evidence and fairly
represented it. This requires careful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the files of
original observations, complete documentation of the conditions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collection that are relevant to the trustworthiness and
credibility of the information, and making transparent and
reproducible the manner in which the evaluator moved from phase to
phase of the analysis. Some
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
evaluators call such a procedure "building an audit trail" and
use procedures similar to indexing and referencing to establish
both the construct validity of the measures reported and the
convincingness of the causal explanations developed in the case
study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Halpern</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>). That is, they have an independent evaluator
review the equivalent of their workpapers rather than providing so
much detail in the report itself that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> can come to the same
conclusion.
Some information in a case study is likely to be judgmental,
particularly when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant-observer</ENAMEX> modes of data
collection are used. And the collection process involves judgment
calls of promising leads and the meaning of initial information.
While documenting the basis for judgments can be more difficult
than documenting nonjudgmental information, overall the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of
evidence or audit trail techniques should not pose any greater
difficulty for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> evaluators than our documentation procedures for
other evaluation methods.
Case studies, obviously, can generate a great deal of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX> data, data that need to be analyzed sufficiently
and with appropriate techniques in order to be useful. Much is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX>. As table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.1</NUMEX> indicates, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> general features
of data analysis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> are essential to case study methods:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iteration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OTTR</ENAMEX>, triangulation, and ruling out rival
explanations.
A unique feature of case studies is that data collection and
analysis are concurrent. In most methods, we plan for data
collection, then we collect the information, then we analyze it,
and then we write the report. In case studies, the data coming in
are analyzed as they become available, and the emerging results are
used to shape the next set of observations.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
The sequence in which this takes place is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OTTR</ENAMEX>, which stands
for "observe, think, test, revise." After observations have been
made in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase (and during the observations, because that
is a natural way for our minds to work), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> think about
the meaning of the information: what does it suggest about what is
happening and why? What else could explain what is going on?

<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, or "think," phase ends with specification of what new
information would be needed to rule out alternative explanations or
confirm interpretations. This triggers the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> phase: test. In
this phase, the
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
evaluator collects more information, as required by the
specifications from the "think" cycle. The data collected in the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> phase are not specified before the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase: they emerge,
often with surprises, from the initial observations. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
phase is examination of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of data collection and a
revision of initial interpretations and expectations-the "revise"
phase. The revise phase may lead to another test phase, if
information from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of data collection was
insufficient to rule out alternatives, or if, during revision, new
interpretations emerged. This iterative process ends when a
plausible explanation has been developed and, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of a</TIMEX>
"revise" phase, there are no outlier or unexplained data, no
further interpretations possible, or it is clear that despite the
most diligent search for information, more is not available to
further refine description and explanation.
In case study methods, causality is established through the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> consistency and plausibility of explanation, derived
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">additively</ENAMEX> through the OTTR sequence. This is in considerable
contrast to other evaluation methods, where control and comparison
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are used subtractively to rule out other reasons for a
finding and establish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> attribution.
Several techniques have been developed recently forHandling
handling multisite case study data sets. These includeMultisite
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> setting up a matrix of categories, graphic data Sets displays,
tabulating frequencies, developing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-tabulations</ENAMEX>, and time series analysis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix of Categories</ENAMEX> In this technique, a coding scheme is
developed prior to data collection. It is modified during data
collection and the OTTR process and finalized after the evaluation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> has read through all the case
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphic Data Displays</ENAMEX>
materials. The categories are related to the evaluation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subquestions</ENAMEX>; for example, if a subquestion was "How does the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> monitor the conditions of
confinement in privately contracted detention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>," coding
categories might include who is responsible, how these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> get
information, what they do with information received, evidence that
minimum standards are met, evidence of shortfalls, changes over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in monitoring, and conflicting guidance or responsibilities.
These categories might be put into a matrix by facility size or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> served. The approach is similar to content analysis, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEMD</ENAMEX> transfer paper on content analysis gives further how-to
information (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1982</TIMEX>).
This is a family of techniques, some of which have been adapted
for computers and some of which use wall-space. The evaluators
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immerse</ENAMEX> themselves in information on a site, following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OTTR</ENAMEX>. Their
initial story of what is happening and why is displayed as a
flowchart with a series of critical paths for action. Evidence
supporting the story is arrayed in the display. The materials then
are searched for counterevidence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiary</ENAMEX> or branching paths
are laid out. As a satisfactory graphic is developed for one site,
the evaluators turn to the next site. The evaluators could at this
point either modify the first graphic, based on information from
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> site, or prepare an independent flowchart. In the second
approach, aggregation would come after all the sites had been
charted, and the charts would be used as the data base for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX>.
The graphic techniques can be applied to an instance as a whole
or to subcomponents. For example, if an analysis of
life-threatening or fatal incidents at
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tabulating Event Frequencies</ENAMEX>
national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> were needed, the evaluators might develop
separate graphics for events leading up to the incidents, the
incidents themselves, and postincident actions. More complex case
studies might need several "layers" or graphics; less complex,
few.
Another technique for analyzing multisite case data is
identifying events within each case study ("meeting between Jones
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>"; "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> staff prepares recommendations") and tabulating
their frequency of occurrence. Such a simple tabulation can draw
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">evaluator</ENAMEX>'s attention to events that may be significant or to
informal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and give a sense of actual (as contrasted to
on-paper) organizational relationships. Divergences between
observed and expected patterns can be examined further to see what
happens as a result of these meetings and identify potential
problem nodes: for example, when an expected high-communication
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">node</ENAMEX> turns out to be, relatively speaking, a low-communication
spot.
Complex Tabulations
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>-tabulations of events can identify interactions and check
the developing story more formally. For example, service
coordination is a popular remedy for limited funds. An evaluator in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> may observe that coordination among local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> funded
through the same federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is more frequent than coordination
among local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> funded by different federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>.
Tabulations of actual meetings and of consequent actions for
same-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> funded and different-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> can help
check out whether this impression is reliable.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Series Analysis Organization</ENAMEX> of information within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
site by time of occurrence, coupled with a systematic analysis of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contextual</ENAMEX> influences on events, permits a
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Basic Models</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>
nonquantitative time series analysis for case study data. The
flow of events over time for each significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> and for
significant points in the series of events forms the organizing
framework for data analysis within each site. Such comparisons of
when key actions occurred, how well (or poorly) they were carried
out, and what influenced both timing and quality of performance can
be particularly helpful in case studies of program
implementation.
In some instances, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> component of a case study may be
analyzed in this way. For example, a case study of the
effectiveness of a job training program might need to take into
account general economic trends, such as unemployment rates in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. A time series comparing local unemployment rates with
placement rates for job training program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> could be
computed quantitatively and changes interpreted through the more
qualitative time series data about the program.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> basic models of data analysis are pattern matching and
explanation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Pattern matching requires using past
experience, logic, or theory before the job begins to specify what
we expect to find. The analysis then compares actual findings to
expectations. When the findings fit, the pattern is confirmed. When
the findings don't fit, the evaluator adjusts the expectations or
elaborates them, building a subroutine that can explain the
unexpected findings. Explanation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is the inverse procedure:
starting with the observations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">evaluator</ENAMEX> develops a picture of
what is happening and why. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are used to fill in the initial
hunches, to change them, to elaborate on them. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strategy
matches findings to hypotheses or assumptions. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> uses the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to structure the hypotheses or assumptions.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
In either strategy, the evaluator needs to search the full data
base thoroughly for disconfirming evidence, in order to avoid the
pitfall of premature conclusions and data analysis ends when the
best fit possible has been reached between the observations and a
statement about what they mean.
In either strategy, expectations and explanations can be
expressed as themes: a job dealing with bank failures, for example,
might have as themes decisions about credit risks, procedures for
reviewing decisions, or controls over the accuracy and recency of
information on bank solvency. A job dealing with employee training
might have as themes decisions about training needs, how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
are selected for training, how course quality is monitored, or how
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> view the purpose of training.
Themes, in turn, can be analyzed within individual sites <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
then findings on each theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aggregated</ENAMEX> across sites. Alternatively,
all themes within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one</NUMEX> site can be analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>; then data from
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (and subsequent) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> can be examined. Theme analysis
also can proceed in matrix fashion. On the PEMD AFDC study, for
example, evaluators were assigned as site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, responsible for
understanding across themes all there was to know about the issues
for their site. They also were assigned to individual themes, such
as health and employment, responsible concurrently for looking
across all sites for information on their topic. This organization
proved helpful in ensuring that reasons why a site showed up as an
outlier for a given theme could be discussed by someone who knew
the site as a whole.
Case study methods, like any other method, offer


Pitfalls and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Booby Traps</ENAMEX> plenty of opportunity to go awry. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> frequent
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
concerns are the risks in using other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s studies and in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generalizability</ENAMEX>.
Impartiality The biggest risk when we use other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s case
studies is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> standards of impartiality may not have been
met. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> meanings of impartiality, one of which does
not create problems. Case studies use as data the impressions and
judgments of the evaluator, which are inherently subjective. For a
case study methodologist and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, if proper care is taken, this
should not be a problem. If we want to illustrate, for example,
working conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant laborers</ENAMEX>, we can report what the
thermometers registered and we can also report, firsthand, how
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were sweating and what it felt like to be out in the fields.
Such observation is part of the richness, immediacy, and "thick"
description of a case study. However, case studies, like any other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">method GAO</ENAMEX> uses, have to meet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other criteria of impartiality:
accuracy and lack of bias, in the sense that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">evaluator</ENAMEX>'s
personal, preconceived opinions about a situation do not distort
reporting and that the evaluator is scrupulously evenhanded in
examining all sides of a situation.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> on evaluation methods believe that case studies
reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s values in ways that can be difficult to
detect. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> conclude that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> actions, taken together,
are sufficient safeguards for lack of bias and adequate accuracy.
These are (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) submitting reports to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from whom data were
collected and printing their critiques with the report, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) use of
multiple data collection methods within case studies, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
adoption of the audit trail or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-of-evidence technique.
Adequate supervisory controls also are recommended. Complying with
these safeguards should give us no
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
major problems in our own jobs. The guidance would mainly expand
the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>. We already conduct exit conferences and,
following the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Yellow Book</ENAMEX>" and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Manual</ENAMEX>, submit draft
reports for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> comments. We often use multiple methods, and the
audit trail technique now recommended for case study use was itself
adopted from such auditing procedures as workpapers and
referencing, which are standard practice with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. We also require
adequate supervisory control through such means as prompt review of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workpapers</ENAMEX>. We would need to assure ourselves, however, that case
studies whose results we are going to use have adopted the same
procedures for ensuring impartiality. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix III</ENAMEX> gives a
checklist for reviewing proposed or completed case studies for
quality.)
Generalizability We often are asked questions where the customer
wants in-depth information that is nationally generalizable, but
frequently the issue may not yet be ripe for a national study or we
do not have the resources to collect in-depth data from nationally
representative samples. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> as case studies
might be feasible, but we would still need to be concerned about
the risks in generalizability. A main point of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is that
generalizability
depends less on the number of sites and more on the right match
between the purpose of the study and
how the instances were selected, taking into account
the diversity of the programs.
An example of an efficient combination of careful specification
of the purpose of the study matched with appropriate site selection
is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGD</ENAMEX> study of the productivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
Administration's (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX>'s) regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. This review examined
in depth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> region (U.S.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11, 1985</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> was
selected because it had the best productivity among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> regions;
if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> could demonstrate opportunities for improvement in the most
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">productive SSA</ENAMEX> region, then similar improvements might be possible
in the less productive regions. Following the case study, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inexpensive</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> staff <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>) check was made on productivity data and
trends from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> regions, and similarities were noted. While
other problems might be affecting these less productive regions,
the findings from the single site plus the trends were so
convincing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> concluded the single instance examination had
national implications. Subsequent analysis of regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> plans
for productivity improvement led to the conclusion that their
implementation could save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $60 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
Sometimes, however, it is not possible to answer the evaluation
question using case studies, if the program is diverse and the user
needs national generalizability. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> may prefer to sacrifice
in-depth information for generalizability and we will have to use
other methods, such as surveys or secondary analysis of existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. However, it often is possible-with appropriate instance
selection-to obtain adequate generalizability with a manageable
number of instances. In addition, the evaluator can apply the case
survey method to increase the generalizability of findings and can
combine case studies with other methods. Taken together, these
strategies can permit the use of the case study technique with
enough generalizability for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' purposes. That is, for the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of case studies (illustrative, exploratory, and
critical instances) generalizability, if needed, cannot be achieved
unless they are combined with other methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generalizability</ENAMEX> can
be achieved for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other types, however, even when they

Summary
We can summarize this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> in the answers to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> questions:
What are case studies? When are they appropriately used in
evaluation? What distinguishes a good case study from a not-good
case study?
The case study is a method of learning about a complex instance,
based on a comprehensive understanding of that instance obtained by
extensive description and analysis of the instance taken as a whole
and in its context. Applying this definition means learning
virtually everything about the instance being studied, including
how it operates and what it does, in relation to the extrinsic or
contextual events it is part of.
Case studies often use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or only a few instances, because
collecting and analyzing comprehensive data are prohibitively
difficult for large numbers of sites. However, not all studies of a
small number of instances are case studies. Some studies collect
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from a small number of sites but have no other features in
common with case studies and offer none of their advantages. Thus,
the fact that a study involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> or a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> does not
automatically make it a case study. For example, the evaluators may
not have selected the sites appropriately for the generalizability
needed or they may have collected minimal information with little
depth of inquiry.

What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Are Case Studies</ENAMEX>?
When <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Are Case Studies Appropriately Used in Evaluation</ENAMEX>?
We discussed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> types of case study that differ considerably in
their requirements for site selection, data collection, and
analysis, among other things. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> types are illustrative,
critical instance, exploratory, program implementation, program
effects, and cumulative. Together, they cover a wide range of
evaluation questions, although clearly not all

What <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Distinguishes a Good From a Not-Good Case Study</ENAMEX>?
evaluation questions. For example, case studies are not well
suited for answering the question, How often does something
happen?
Some applications of the case study to evaluation purposes have
been tried fairly extensively-for example, program implementation
case studies. Others are relatively untried-for example, cumulative
case studies. The latter is a particularly promising method for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, because it can capitalize on the large number of
case-study-like reports that are available, on the quality of the
documentation that supports their findings, and on the general
methodological framework that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s standards provide. We have not
stressed, in our analysis, the costs, feasibility, and timeliness
of case studies, since these are management criteria that are
considered in all designs rather than issues of particular concern
to case studies. However, the implications of the design features
discussed here are that, contrary to what many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think, the
case study is not necessarily inexpensive, easy to conduct, or
quick. It may require in-depth data collection dependent on
sensitivity to the setting that takes time to acquire and involve
extended periods for data analysis, interpretation, and
reporting.
We have addressed quality in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. One is prospective and
intended to help those who plan evaluation to know the minimum
features of the various case study applications. The other is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retrospective</ENAMEX> and intended to help those who review case study
reports to assess the quality of completed case studies. Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">summarizes</ENAMEX> common pitfalls that we have mentioned throughout this
paper.

Study stage Common pitfall
We have presented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> types of case study evaluations and for
each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> described features such as number of sites, site
selection, data collection, data analysis, and reporting. Our
descriptions represent a "floor" of quality for each evaluation
application. The features of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> types of case study are not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interchangeable</ENAMEX>. That is, the features of a case study that are
appropriate for answering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind of evaluation question are not
necessarily appropriate for answering another kind of evaluation
question. Evaluators considering the case study as a design for
evaluation must first decide what type of evaluation question their
specific question is and then examine the strengths and limitations
of each type of case study for answering it. The crucial next step
is to look at the features of each type and decide whether it will
be possible to meet these methodological requirements in the
specific situation.
For example, the basis on which instances can be selected
differs for the different case study applications. Usually, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrative</ENAMEX> case study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> should be typical of the program being
examined
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Overgeneralization</ENAMEX>, compared to actual basis for site selection,
number of sites studied, and requirements for inference in the
design; inadequate interpretation, unintegrated narrative, results
not adequately related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> questions; inadequate attention to
threats to impartiality and the extent to which these have been
avoided
Quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evaluation Design</ENAMEX>: Reviewing
while exploratory case study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> should bracket the diversity
that is likely to be encountered in the program, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and
setting of a larger study. Usually, sites for program effects case
studies should be selected with great care for criteria such as
whether there is evidence that the program has been implemented at
the site, whether the site has been subjected to changes that could
have the same effects as the program or that could mask its
effects, and how the addition of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of sites
being studied supports the generalizability of the findings.
Turning to ways of assessing the quality of completed case
studies, we have provided guidelines for reviewing case study
reports in appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>. These guidelines are intended to apply to
all types of case study applications.
On matters of design, the guidelines discuss the clarity of
issues, the relationship of the evaluation question to the case
study application selected, the basis for case study selection, and
the time span of the study. The data-collection guidelines
emphasize appropriateness of data-collection methods, evaluator
training, and information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. Guidelines for data-base
formation and analysis deal with explicitness of procedures and
techniques, interpretation differences, and the relationship of the
findings to those of similar studies. With regard to reporting, the
guidelines emphasize constraints on the study, arguments for and
against various resolutions of the issues, and the role of judgment
in reaching conclusions. With regard to impartiality and
generalizability, the guidelines emphasize that a good case study
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> (or, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> purposes, job documentation) describes both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evaluators</ENAMEX>' training and work on related studies, presents

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impartiality</ENAMEX> and Generalizability
comments on the draft report, and supplies adequate information
for judging generalizability. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reviewers</ENAMEX> will need to refer in
addition to the features of each special type of case study
application for supplementary guidance on what to look for in
individual case studies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partiality</ENAMEX> and-in some instances-the inability to generalize
from the findings can limit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of case study methods for
evaluation. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main threats to impartiality:
subjectivity, inaccuracy, and bias. The case study method
inherently requires subjective and judgmental elements. When proper
procedural safeguards are used, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> alone do not
diminish the value of case study methods. However, inaccuracy and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> are unacceptable in any case study. Some ways of detecting and
preventing bias, such as the audit trail, have been well developed.
Their applicability to case study evaluations outside of settings
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is being explored.
Many evaluation questions do not require a high degree of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generalizability</ENAMEX>. Certain case study applications provide high
degrees of generalizability with small numbers of instances. When
both broad generalizations and in-depth understanding are required,
designs that cumulate case studies over a wide number of sites and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX>, or that combine case study methods and other methods in
one concurrent effort may meet this dual need (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General</ENAMEX>
Accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2, 1984</TIMEX>). However, the diversity of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to which generalization is required is a limiting factor
in case study applications. It is also true that without careful
attention to standards, case studies are prone to the kind of
overgeneralization that comes from selecting a few instances,
assuming without evidence that they are typical or representative
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and then offering national projections. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
Project <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manual</ENAMEX> cautions against overgeneralization from any method.
For case studies in particular, there must be an empirical basis
for instance selection and assurance of adequate population
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homogeneity</ENAMEX>.
Appendix I



Theory and History
As a research method, the case study originates in the social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sciences</ENAMEX>, particularly in the fieldwork of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anthropology</ENAMEX> and
sociology. Within these disciplines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have defined the
case study and discussed its critical elements in a variety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>. In general, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> appear frequently: purpose, type of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collected, method of data collection, design, method of data
analysis, and reporting.
The research case study has been defined as a method
Purpose for learning the "right" questions to ask (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoaglin et</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>). That is, the purpose of case studies is said by some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to be to generate hypotheses rather than to test or
confirm them. The method involves an in-depth, longitudinal
examination of a single instance. The product is a sharpened
understanding of what might be important to look at further in
similar situations and what explains why the instance happened as
it did. Because such inquiry explores <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> situation, it is
argued that it cannot contribute directly to the testing of general
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">propositions</ENAMEX>, although it can contribute powerfully to the
invention of hypotheses.
Some other methods have a similar purpose. Exploratory analyses
of large data bases are often used to select a smaller number of
variables for additional testing, on the basis of interesting
patterns that emerged from various combinations of the elements of
the large data base. Promising relationships are singled out and
those that seem uninteresting are set aside. Like findings from
case studies, the result is considered as contributing not answers
but a better understanding of what questions to ask and how to ask
them.
An analogy might be drawn also to "evaluability assessment."
Such assessment may provide
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
information valuable in itself about how completely a program
has been implemented. It is undertaken prior to testing the effects
of the program, chiefly, however, as an indicator of appropriate
evaluation design.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> regard case studies as not only a different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> of knowing but as a better way (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rist</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1982a</ENAMEX>). More
specifically, they emphasize the method's unique value in many
complex situations of importance, such as studies of school
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">desegregation</ENAMEX>, or economically distressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, or the
Challenger tragedy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason they give is that skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewers</ENAMEX> can make judgments and valuations about factors
that are otherwise very difficult to assess, such as how much
effort a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> made to get information before a key decision was
made or how much that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> knew about what was going on. Also,
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> believe, in complex situations the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
who are significantly involved have different "realities" in their
explanation of events and even in their perceptions of what
happened, and this is best matched with a method that gradually
represents and reconstructs these multiple realities, rather than a
method that assumes a single "truth" exists.
As seen by such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>,
"there is no single reality on which inquiry may converge, but
rather there are multiple realities that are socially constructed,
and that, when known more fully, tend to produce diverging reality.
These multiple and constructed realities can not be studied in
pieces (as variables, for example), but only holistically, since
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> are interrelated in such a way as to influence all other
pieces. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> themselves are sharply influenced by
the nature of the immediate context."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Methodologists</ENAMEX> who focus on case studies express their criteria
of good research in different language, although they may deal with
underlying concerns
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
similar to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> from more experiment-oriented
traditions. Some criteria, however, are seen as unique to case
studies and qualitative approaches. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is fairness or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> that a study has presented a balanced view of the many
constructions of reality and the values underlying these. Another
example is authenticity; another, realism. Each of these criteria
is associated, in the literature on case study methods, with
performance standards such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triangulation</ENAMEX> believed useful in
ensuring-if they are carried out-that the study will be a good
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.


Type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
In some textbooks on evaluation, case studies are synonymous
with qualitative data-that is, data that are subjective or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgmental</ENAMEX>. Such data include narratives of events written by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant observers</ENAMEX>, accounts of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> understood
about an event, reports of what was said at a meeting or an
interview, observational records of how an event took place, and
statements of impressions about what was going on, why it was
happening, and how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> felt about it, themselves, or each
other.
To illustrate differences among types of information, we might
base the conclusion that "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> was hot" on data from an
instrument that records the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature (numerical and
objective), a record of the atmospheric temperature as written down
by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> checking a thermometer (numerical and relatively
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonsubjective</ENAMEX>), a survey asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> how hot they felt
(nonnumerical and subjective), and a "thick" description of what
clothes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were wearing, how much they perspired or shivered,
whether they turned up the furnace or the air conditioner, and how
much energy they seemed to have for work (nonnumerical and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">judgmental</ENAMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> describe case studies as using
qualitative data, they usually mean the "thick" description. If the
evaluation question involved an understanding of working conditions
for migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in heavy industry, a thick
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">description</ENAMEX>, even including information on how exhausted the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evaluator</ENAMEX> felt in the heat, would be more appropriate-according to
some case study methodologists-than only recording that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermometer</ENAMEX> registered <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">95 degrees</NUMEX>.
Suppose we needed to know about the availability of housing for
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> records were adequate, good
quantitative measures of availability might be the number of
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> applying for housing relative to the number of
units that met minimum standards and cost within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of
household income or the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> on waiting lists for such
housing and how long they had to wait. We might also be able to
report the number of applications for housing construction permits
and how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> suitable for low-income housing were coming on
the market within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>. Often, however, the records are not
adequate. Here we might rely on qualitative information, such as
the estimates of knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of demand and supply
(judgmental,
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>


Method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Collection</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">numerical</ENAMEX>) or of severity of the problem (judgmental,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonnumerical</ENAMEX>). We might also interview selected low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
with regard to their experience in seeking housing or we might, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant-observers</ENAMEX>, pose as low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> and report our
own experiences in finding housing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of different sizes
and within different payment ranges (judgmental, numerical, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonnumerical</ENAMEX>).
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who write case studies use qualitative data
because they believe them to be richer, more insightful, and more
flexible than quantitative data. They believe that the meaning of
an event is more likely to be caught in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the qualitative</TIMEX> net than on
the quantitative hook. For example, qualitative data permit dealing
fairly directly with values, politics, and factors that may be an
important part of many situations. A frequency distribution of
events-such as a table showing the number of decision points in a
community economic development program and a decrease in the
probability of action as the number of decision points
increases-are about as numerical as qualitative data are likely to
be in a research case study, according to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>.
To some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, case studies are synonymous with methods of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collection deriving from anthropology, psychology, and
sociology. The techniques include fieldwork, ethnography,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> observation and have in common that an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observer</ENAMEX> is physically present at a site, stays at the site for a
fairly long time, has flexibility in deciding what data to collect
from whom and under what circumstances, and can organize the
inquiry according to the meaning of events to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
rather than having to decide beforehand
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
on a closed set of constructs or data elements. In most
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> is the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Mead</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Samoa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Lewis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>
are famous examples.
The greatest difference, to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> other methods
and case studies is the distinction between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
beginning by presuming, a priori, to know the relevant constructs
and variables, measuring their incidence, and finding out how
changes in them may be influenced by other events and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) entering
into an event to learn what is significant in it to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. As this implies, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, the case study is an
intensely personal method, dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, insights, and skill in noticing many things, recording
them, and producing a narrative that suggests a pattern of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>-or that recognizes the pattern that is there in the
culture in its own terms. It is a demanding method, requiring
specific skills (such as fluency in the language of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>) and general self-awareness to maintain the fine
balance between seeing things as others see them and identifying
their perspective wholly with one's own. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> must weigh
the value of experiencing what it is like to be part of the culture
against the hazard of internalizing the experience too fully, which
can jeopardize the capacity to see the culture from many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspectives</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, some of the best reports have come from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> who entered as fully as possible as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the
event being investigated.
The case study method is further distinguished by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>'s self-conscious effort to understand what the observed
events mean to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> can enter a scene
without preconceived ideas, but they can be set aside. Thus, a
study of how a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is organized economically might begin with
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
finding out what is valued in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and how items of value
are exchanged. They might not be goods or services, and exchanges
might not be equal.
For example, in a basic research study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belle</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> lived for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX> among them as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>, confidantes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, listening to what they said
and noting what they did. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found that turning to
someone for even modest help (like minding a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>) had
the cost of later demands for a return of the favor and that this
cost was nearly intolerable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found expected
stresses like the loss of a check in the mail and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> of
loved ones. They found also, unexpectedly, that any change at all
was stressful: being promoted to a higher-paying job, the
graduation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, falling in love, even the
restoration to health of a loved one who had been ill. In terms of
the purposes of the study-finding out what was stressful to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and why the incidence of mental health problems among them
was so high-the case study method disclosed the importance of any
change in life circumstances as a source of stress rather than
merely confirming change that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> might have thought
stressful a priori.
Case study methods have been defined by some
Design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> as designs that focus on a single instance or
a few instances. They also are identified with designs that are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexperimental</ENAMEX> in the sense that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> is not
deliberately manipulating some variable to see its possible effects
on the system being studied. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> classic aims of inquiry are to
understand the nature of events and to understand their causes.
Since case study designs center on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or a few cases and lack the
controls usually thought necessary to an understanding of causal
relationships, knowledge that
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
results from case studies is controversial with regard to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generalizability</ENAMEX> and causality.
With regard to generalizability, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methodologists</ENAMEX> see case
studies as above all particular, seeking to describe and understand
the aspects of an instance without much concern for knowing whether
they arise in or are characteristic of a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The
focus is on this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, this emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, this military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>,
or this nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> can choose relatively
freely which instance to study on any one of several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>,
depending on the questions to be examined.
Thus, in a case study design, an instance may be selected
because it is a unique event of national interest, such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> missile crisis or the distribution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> flu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX>,
both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of research case studies. The instance may be
selected because it has been affected by events of interest, such
as the desegregation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. It may be selected as an unusually
effective or unusually ineffective instance. However, whenever the
purpose is an understanding of the particular, the relationship of
the instance to the various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that it is part of is less
important than the assurance that the selected instance can be
fully examined.
With regard to causality, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> using case study methods
cannot rely on familiar ways of ruling out alternative
explanations. Case studies do not compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to
others randomly assigned to different treatments. Case studies do
not use statistical adjustments to facilitate comparison. Case
studies do not estimate statistically the influence of the many
variables on the instance being examined. To understand a single
case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> must develop hunches about what is happening
in the instance under study and systematically seek within it
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
evidence consistent or inconsistent with the hunches. As
evidence accumulates, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> tier of evidence is looked for that
would be consistent or inconsistent with alternative explanations
for why the hunches did or did not take the shape of a coherent
pattern. That is, a very high standard of inferential logic is
needed.
When this method produces a coherent, plausible story, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> can assert a relationship between cause and effect. When
conflicting evidence cannot be resolved, the careful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>
indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">causality</ENAMEX> cannot be established. The standard for
making this judgment requires the diligence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> in
formulating alternative explanations of what is happening, in
specifying the kind of evidence that would be supportive or
nonsupportive, in searching intensively for evidence that would
rule out initial hypotheses, and in thoroughly considering the
reasons for inconsistent patterns of evidence in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> tier.
These techniques, of course, have parallels in other research
traditions.
The ability of the case study to capitalize on insight, to shift
focus as the data demand, and to let disparate pieces of evidence
fall into place in ways that are not always easy to describe or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> is believed to yield a richer, fuller, and truer
explanation of why things look the way they do than the more
limited number of tests of a priori hypotheses that other methods
use. In case studies, the criterion for deciding whether casuality
has been established is the coherence of the evidence, its
consistency with the patterns ascribed to it, and its inconsistency
with other explanations. In research designs based on statistical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inference</ENAMEX>, the criterion for establishing casuality is whether the
findings are likely to have occurred by chance following
appropriate comparisons to eliminate alternative
interpretations.

Method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Analysis</ENAMEX>
In both instances, comparisons must be appropriate if
alternative explanations are to be ruled out.
Still another distinguishing feature of case studies, according
to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, is a nonstatistical approach to data analysis.
The elements of analysis are familiar: the identification of
regularities, patterns, and relationships and the assessment of
their importance of meaning. In quantitative methods, the
regularities are identified by manipulating numbers to produce
indicators agreed on as sensible descriptions of the patterns. For
example, an average is a convention that creates a single number to
represent the collection of all the numbers in a set. Importance or
meaning is assessed in part by estimating the variability within
the set of numbers to obtain a probability that the regularity
represents the characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of instances.
The logic of analysis in case studies is the same; the
techniques for identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regularities</ENAMEX> and assessing their meaning
are different. Consider first the regularities. The case study
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> is trying to build an accurate description and explanation
of events as both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> frame them. There
would be little point in trying to identify a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> as an
accurate representation of something this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> searches for clusters or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> in the data, using
verbal notes and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">graphic aids</ENAMEX>, reviewing field data and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> of observations, until a pattern is evident. Then the data
base is searched for further evidence that confirms or conflicts
with the pattern. When the evidence is more inconsistent than
consistent, the pattern is rejected. When the evidence is more
consistent than not, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> confirms the pattern and looks for
others related to it. When all the
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
evidence is consistent, no further examination is needed. An
array of techniques such as graphic displays has been developed to
help standardize case study analysis.
A key element of case study analysis is the selection and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of material to account for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> and
interactions of the events. The rules are judgmental, not
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">probabilistic</ENAMEX>. Have all the pieces of pertinent information been
considered? Has adequate attention been given to the outliers? Does
the pattern seem plausible or forced? Have inconsistencies been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensibly</ENAMEX> resolved?
Using an analogy, we can say that the case study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> seeks
to explain <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> of the variance by relying on a data base
that includes more variables than most quantitative studies can
accommodate, over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> points in time, and on a method that draws
on the integrative powers of the mind, which computers do not have.
The method inherited from sociology and anthropology entails early
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immersion</ENAMEX> in the setting, recorded observations, reflections on the
spot, and analysis that occur throughout fieldwork, as data are
being collected. Analysis is infused throughout the research
process in case studies; it is not a step after the completion of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collection.
Case studies are usually reported as narratives that
Reporting read like chronologies of what led up to an event and
what happened during and after it. They have been called
"then-they-did-this" studies. In order to be comprehensive and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cohesive</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> provide a great deal of detail and
description and quote directly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' own words and
vignettes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>' field records.
To some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of case studies, the credibility of the
method depends on what they call "naturalistic generalizability."
By this they mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> compare their own observations,
experience, and belief to the narrative and regard the parts of the
investigation that are consistent with these as confirmed. What is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inconsistent</ENAMEX> tends to be examined more closely and may be rejected
as less credible, unless-so the argument runs-there is enough
detail that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> can "see it with their own eyes." For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>
who know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped child</ENAMEX> or have an aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, for example,
a case study report of conditions in residential care for the
severely handicapped or the aged may compare dramatically with
vivid personal experiences. The case study report can provide an
organizing framework for thinking about these and other
experiences.
The usefulness of case study reports, therefore, depends to some
degree on how well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> has portrayed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> of thinking about what happened and on how divergent the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>'s analysis is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>'s ways of thinking about
the subject. The credibility and authenticity of the case study
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> may depend on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>'s having provided extensive detail
and description, making unexpected conclusions as difficult to deny
as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> had been part of the event. In this respect, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">narrative</ENAMEX> mode is not a stylistic choice; it is inherent in the
purpose of case studies and the nature of their inquiry. It becomes
an obstacle only when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> seek publication through outlets
whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> generally ask for brief details.
The traditional case study belongs to research, notThe Case
Study evaluation. To apply case study methods toAdapted for
evaluation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> have had to adapt what derived Evaluation
largely from sociological and anthropological
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fieldwork</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patton</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>). Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, however, evaluation case
studies were similar to research case studies. They were
longitudinal, were made by on-site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> who sought
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant-observer</ENAMEX> roles, and constituted an inquiry structured
from an evolving understanding of events and their meaning to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> involved in them. There was usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> research
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>, and the data consisted of descriptions, observations,
impressions, unstructured interviews, and existing materials
gathered at the site that were organized intuitively and
informally. The case study report was a narrative whose purpose was
to illustrate or portray what a program was like, how it was being
implemented, and how those who were part of it both affected it and
were affected by it.
In these early uses of the case study method, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> wrote
their reports to stand alone. Little effort was made to integrate
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of data, even when the evaluation design
included them, although simple references might be made to the
number of times a feature of other sites was also characteristic of
the site reported in the study. The case study was useful for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> interested in what a particular program was like or what
happened to a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX>.
Early in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>'s when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> wanted to design studies
that would capture some implementation or outcome features that
were different or expensive to measure reliably on a large
scale-for example, the way a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> handled a complex
innovation or the effect of an education program on motivation to
learn or growth in self-confidence-they felt caught between risking
considerable effort in trying to quantify qualitative variables and
risking the criticism that they were ignoring really important
things because they could not be measured. The case study seemed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> out. It
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>


The Study Questions
offered a relatively inexpensive, low-risk supplement to the
large-scale collection of other information that could be measured
more cheaply and reliably than with large-scale studies. By and
large, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> commissioned to carry out the early case study
evaluations had been trained in the academic disciplines with the
strongest fieldwork traditions, and they had to struggle with the
extent to which their research method could be adapted to
evaluation, retain its integrity, and yield positive benefits. The
struggle is not yet fully over.
The first adaptation was a shift of the specification of study
question from the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> during the period of study
performance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who commissioned the study in advance of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> collection. For example, those who supported an evaluation of
a training program might want the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to find out whether
the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' self-concepts, self-esteem,
task orientation, work habits, and personal and social traits
seemed associated with the program or with something else.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> from fieldwork traditions would have argued that
they could provide the most useful information by spending some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> at the site of the training program, trying to understand what
the program meant to those who were involved in it, and reporting
on what was happening from the perspective of those who were making
it happen. Since this might have everything to do what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' chance to socialize with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in a nonthreatening
environment and nothing to do with self-esteem or work habits, it
seemed to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> that it was therefore logical not to
decide on the evaluation questions until their appropriateness
could be determined.
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
The compromise that has developed is to include in the
evaluation the questions of interest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and to permit
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to determine what data elements are relevant to
these questions and from whom and how they should be collected. It
allows the evaluator to remain alert to other questions that might
prove more salient if allowed to emerge.
How satisfactory is the compromise? The final reports of some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-GAO</ENAMEX> case studies show little or no resemblance between the
final questions and those in the approved study proposal, and a
number of issues about this have not been resolved. We do not know
whether the discrepancy is more frequent in case studies than in
other methods. It may be that the final questions are the ones the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> wanted to look at all along, so that the methodology
is vulnerable to subterfuge. Possibly the emergent questions were
those that should reasonably have been expected to come into
focus-and whose emergence may be why case studies rather than
surveys are used. From the perspective of the authenticity and
integrity of results, the larger public interest may have been
served. If the method is highly susceptible to this kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> change, the appropriate scope for case studies should be
examined. When the case study involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site and modest expense,
the price for identifying better questions early may seem
affordable.
This is not to say that all case study evaluations show
divergence between the questions that were asked and those that
were answered or that an appropriate balance between the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evaluator's</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>'s needs is never reached. However,
applying the case study methods of research to evaluation requires
dealing with matters of control, power, and responsibility that
were less visible in the work of
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>


The Number of Sites
academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> before their methods were adapted to
evaluation.
The demands of evaluation led to other adjustments in
ethnographic methods. One such demand was that a method developed
for understanding the particular had to be modified for learning
about the general. Another was the need for something more adequate
than "naturalistic generalization" for evaluation purposes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX>
was the problem of site variation, which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970</TIMEX>'s was
identified in quantitative studies as an ill-understood source of
greater differences in a program's outcomes than the program
itself.
The case study method seemed born to help, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and cost associated with making multisite evaluations led to
considerable adaptation. First, since evaluators often needed
simultaneous study at several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, they needed several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>,
which created issues of coordination and interpretation. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,
the cost of maintaining a trained full-time field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> at a site
runs high, so that evaluators had to settle for shorter
observations or untrained field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> or both.
All these changes-to multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>, professionally
supervised but not professionally trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>, and shorter
observation times-led to others. The across-sites data base got
much larger as the number of sites in a study rose. The
within-sites data bases became less extensive as observation times
were shortened. It became a challenge to integrate the work of
different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> if they focused their attention on different
topics from site to site. And this much larger, much less
extensive, probably less reliable data base had to be analyzed and
reported in a much shorter time than that of fairly
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
leisurely academic research. Not surprisingly, analysis has
become a major methodological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, and more structured and
perhaps more efficient approaches to analysis have been
developed.
To these adaptations, another was added. The case study was
given a purpose-program evaluation-beyond that of illustration,
exploration, or generation of hypotheses. As the examination of
program implementation and program effectiveness became more
central to the case study, so did the ability to generalize
findings. In turn, quantitative methods in case studies
expanded.
Quantitative methods were incorporated in the case study in two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was in triangulation: the use of several forms of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> within a single case study in order to give many reference
points for verifying patterns and ruling out alternative
explanations in order to achieve what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evaluators</ENAMEX> call "internal
validity." The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> was in the combination of case study methods
with other methods, particularly surveys, in order to achieve the
generalizability that evaluators called "external validity." These
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adaptations</ENAMEX> created the need for a better understanding of the
relationship between case study techniques and other techniques and
between quantitative and qualitative approaches within case
studies.


Quantitative Methods
Summary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table I.2</ENAMEX> summarizes the changes that have been made to adapt
the research case study to evaluators' needs. Adapting the research
case study to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">evaluator</ENAMEX>'s needs has entailed a number of
changes. Less time is spent at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. Information is collected by
junior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> working under the supervision of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>
trained in case study methods. More time
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
is allowed for training and monitoring quality. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are
combined from several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> to allow generalization; and data
collection has been given greater structure. Methods of assessing
the reliability of observations, techniques for transforming very
large amounts of qualitative data, and methods for aggregating
qualitative data or findings from several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> have been
developed. The ability to generalize has become a matter of design
and analysis. Reporting methods have changed.




Case studies in evaluation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> have made these adaptations in
different degrees. Some studies have not only generalized but also
tested hypotheses. Some case studies rely wholly on quantitative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Some rely wholly on information collected by others, not
trained as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX> or anthropologists, rather than on
firsthand observation. Some aim for uniformity or comparability of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> both within a site with multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> and across several
sites. Some use inferential statistics as well as descriptive
statistics.
Some present findings and conclusions in forms closely
resembling those of other methods.
These adaptations are not uniformly valued. Some case study
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methodologists</ENAMEX> work with structured evaluation questions,
structured data collection, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> untrained as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anthropologists</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX>, but they believe that case studies
offer a qualitative way of knowing that should not be merged with
quantitative results. Others believe that case studies cannot be
used for making the kind of generalizations that probabilistic
models are used for, so that little is to be gained and so much is
to be lost from increasing the number of sites. Still others
believe in using many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in case studies for evaluations and see
the next step as establishing more explicit procedures for
analyzing data and reviewing quality.
"Case study" means different things to different methodologists,
who reach different conclusions about how to do case studies, how
to report them, and their overall appro-priateness for answering a
specific question. If case studies can vary so greatly, how can we
assess their usefulness for evaluation? <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way is to develop a
working definition of the case study that embodies its essential
methodological features and then to examine the strengths and
limitations of case studies for different evaluation questions.
This is the approach taken in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> in developing our initial
definition.

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Question 1: Instance Selection</ENAMEX>
Imagine that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, within an effort to estimate the extent of
tax revenues lost or delayed from the failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> to file
returns, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> examined revenue shortfalls
to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Imagine we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170,076</NUMEX> such instances (a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">national</TIMEX> projection based on a sample) and estimated that,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cumulatively</ENAMEX>, over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX> was lost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Our report
attracted much congressional interest. Variation among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in
the rate of such "missing returns" was of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.
Imagine we now have been asked to examine in more detail what
explains differences among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in "missing returns," since
cumulatively the effect is to make states look poorer than they
actually would be if they collected revenues authorized by their
own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislatures</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypothetical</ENAMEX> data for this example are given in

Best Case <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have missing returns (unfiled) rates of
less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX>. These are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> are relatively small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> has implemented
a special initiative. Adding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> unfiled rates to
the pool would not add larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, however, since these are
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>. It may be
that the correlation between "smaller" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and very low rates of
unfiled returns is a "real" phenomenon that should be examined and
the initial cut of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1 percent</NUMEX> should stand.
Worst Case <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is an outlier, with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-percent</NUMEX> unfiled rate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-percent</NUMEX> rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 percent</NUMEX>. The next
closest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX> each.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Selecting Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> would be a reasonable
worst-case choice.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster Except</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, no information is given about
programs or state initiatives. Using only the data in the table,
several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> for clustering could be considered. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> frequently
used basis is "size of the problem": that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> account for
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 45 percent</NUMEX> of all unfiled returns (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>). This basis
for selection should be ruled out for this job, however, because
there is no meaningful cluster from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, except that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are all among the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The rationale for the job
is bolstering each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s revenue, not the national
pooled aggregrate. Since there are more smaller, semirural states
than big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, the well-being of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> would not
necessarily be best served by examining what happens in the few
larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Another basis might be a
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/PEMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Case Study Evaluations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crosstabulation of state</ENAMEX> size and rate of unfiled returns; here
selection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> could give a reasonable fix on reasons for
the problem but would essentially reproduce the strategy used in
the representative sample. We would conclude that the data in the
table are not sufficient for drawing a cluster sample.
Representative The distribution of unfiled rates is positively
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skewed</ENAMEX>, which means that instances are piled up at the low end and
scattered out over the high end. With such a distribution,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>" in terms of unfiled rates would sensibly mean at
the low (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1 percent</NUMEX>), lower middle (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 3</NUMEX>
percent), upper middle (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX>), and high (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, and
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX>) points. Assuming state size would be a "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> cut"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>
percent), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX>) could be one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to study, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1 percent</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 percent</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 percent</NUMEX>) could form a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of
smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Together, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> also would provide
reasonable geographic representativeness, as well as industrialized
versus more rural spreads.
Typical A frequency distribution of unfiled rates shows that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> had rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, which turns out to be both the mode and the
median for this distribution. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> in this category include
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>. With no other information (for the
purpose of this exercise), if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than 14</NUMEX> case studies were to be
made, selecting states typical in size such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> would make sense.
Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interest New York</ENAMEX> would be of special interest as a
large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with a very low rate of unfiled returns. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> also
is unique in implementing relevant legislation that might have some
national potential.
While it might be possible, given the data in table II.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
Question <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to select <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">purposive bases</ENAMEX>,
would the evaluation question itself present a situation in which
we would want to consider case studies at all?
Answer Yes, but not as a stand-alone method. We have been asked
to examine the reasons for state variation in unfiled returns. One
plausible reason is that the differences are the result of how
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> solicit returns, monitor compliance, and penalize failure to
file. We could obtain tax codes and procedures for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
examine these, interview selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and generate some
plausible patterns. However, understanding reasons for behavior as
complex as not filing is well suited for case studies. Explanations
could range from (for example) failures of managing returns
actually filed, which are quite susceptible to improvement, to
economic cycles that affect business circumstances and that may be
less susceptible to change. Since the underlying concern is that
many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> may be asking for federal assistance when they would
have resources to handle more of their own needs if they collected
revenues owing to them, case studies of a representative sample of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> coupled with examination of the special interest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> could
be an efficient strategy for ensuring that we had a comprehensive
understanding of what was happening and why. To provide the
generalization desirable, the case studies could be followed by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> survey of state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, checking out the findings from
the in-depth studies. Such a sequence could be quite

efficient, since the national survey would not be a fishing
expedition but targeted to verify initial findings. It also would
offer considerable assurance that we had accurately determined
reasons affecting most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
Appendix III




Guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reviewing Case Study Reports</ENAMEX>
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least six</NUMEX> different types of case study application
in evaluation, and their strengths and limitations are different.
Choosing an appropriate method depends on understanding the
evaluation question. What is technically right for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> question is
not necessarily right for another. However, there are standards
that can be applied to all case studies in evaluation. Studies that
fail to meet them have questionable merit. These quidelines present
the minimum standard of quality in case study evaluation, taken in
conjunction with the guidance in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Yellow Book</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Policy Manual</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Manual</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Are the evaluation questions stated clearly and
Design explicitly? A good study informs the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> early in the
report about the questions that were answered and the issues that
were investigated.



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Is the case study application clearly described? Is
it

appropriate? A good case study describes the case study
application that was used. It explains why this application is
appropriate for the kind of evaluation questions that were answered
(descriptive, normative, cause-and-effect). Where several methods
were used, the relationship of the case study to the other methods
is clear and appropriate.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Was the time span of the study long enough to


address the core issues fairly? A good case study
reports how much time the investigation covered in relation to
the history of the instance or program. Case studies aiming at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> analysis of an event as a whole begin as early as
possible in its

history and continue through its completion or stabilization.
Evaluation case studies have covered shorter periods and involved
less on-site investigation than research case studies
characteristically do. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> should recognize, however, that as
time shortens, so may the value of the method as a way of
presenting a comprehensive understanding of the event as a
whole.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Is the basis for case selection presented? Is it
appropriate for the purpose of the case study? A good
case study presents the reasons for selecting the instances that
were examined. The reasons are appropriate for the case study
application, an issue of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> if a generalization of
the findings is intended. For assessing the study's adequacy, the
kind of site selected is as important as the number of sites
selected. Attention should be paid to the physical setting, to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are served by the program, and to variations in
treatment.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Are the methods of data collection presented? Are

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Collection</ENAMEX>
they appropriate for the purpose of the case study?
Unstructured methods may be appropriate for illustrative and
exploratory applications. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Semistructured</ENAMEX> approaches may be
appropriate for critical instance case studies involving multiple
sites, particularly if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> was responsible
for collecting data for several sites.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> collected the data,
how were the other evaluators selected, trained, and
supervised? There is considerable agreement that the consequence
of the many variants in data collection for multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is
uncertain, but providing detailed information on the procedures
that are used and an explanation of the reasons for the approach
are essential to a good case study.

Guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reviewing Case Study Reports</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data Base Formation and Data Analysis Techniques</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Are information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> described clearly and
fully? Are they appropriate? A good case study
presents in detail the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of evidence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX> is
greater than that required in other methods. A good case study
report gives the numbers and positions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> interviewed
and the evidence that they were appropriate for the evaluation. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> should be able to judge from the information that is given
in the case study report how credible the conclusions are in terms
of the appropriateness and completeness of information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
Are the procedures for the formation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>

base described? A good case study describes how the data bases
were formed and presents a justification for decisions that were
made about the qualification, precision, and detail of information
in the data base at each site.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Are the techniques of data-gathering and


data-processing explicitly described? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Readers</ENAMEX> of a
good case study should know how the data were collected and,
step by step, how they were analyzed. If semistructured packets of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX> were used to guide field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> through the issues, a
good case study describes them or includes them in technical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appendixes</ENAMEX>. All the steps of data reduction and coding are
described, along with the basis for transformations in these steps.
The analytic techniques are explicitly described. What data sources
were used in triangulation? In what order? How were discrepant
findings resolved? The validity of case study methods partly
depends on the resolution process. At each step, safeguards should
have been taken for completeness and the reduction of the threat of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>.
Appendix III <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guidelines for Reviewing Case Study Reports</ENAMEX>



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Were there interpretation differences, and if so
how

were they resolved? A good case study is explicit about
differences in the interpretation of evidence and events between
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> of the draft
report. The case study method often uses data that are more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgmental</ENAMEX>, interpretive, and subjective than other methods. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are often less accessible to secondary analysis. Thus, a good
case study states the argument and evidence more plainly than most
reports have to.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
If other studies, investigations, or
experiments


relevant to the issue are available, have their results
been presented and reconciled with the case study
findings? A good case study presents the findings and
conclusions for other studies on the same issue. When the findings
do not converge, the case study reconciles or explains the
differences as far as possible. Completeness of information
requires this step.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Are methodological strengths and limitations
Reporting identified clearly? A good case study reports
methodological strengths and limitations for answering the
evaluation questions and explains the tradeoffs that were
considered and who influenced the decisions. When several
decisionmakers were involved, a good case study describes the types
of decisions each one made and the constraints on those
decisions.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Are the arguments for various resolutions of the
evaluation question presented? Most case studies are
on topics about which some kind of opinion has been formed. In a
good case study, the conceptual framework for organizing the
inquiry is quite explicit about expectations. A good case study
identifies the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impartiality</ENAMEX> and Generalizability
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the issue that was examined and presents the initial
arguments in favor of the various resolutions and the findings of
the study that support these resolutions.



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Are the arguments against various resolutions
of

the issue presented? A good case study presents the initial
arguments against the various resolutions of the issue that was
considered. Case study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> are supposed to seek evidence
that confirms and evidence that contradicts the observations and
conclusions. Explicitly stating the initial arguments for and
against various resolutions helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> know how thoroughly the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> considered the issues and how thoroughly they sought
evidence on both sides.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
Does the case study identify the factors
explaining


the phenomena that were observed and state clearly
whether the identification of these factors was based
on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insight</ENAMEX> and recognition or on quantitative
techniques? Case studies are undertaken for their explanatory
power and their superior ability to identify the reasons for
problems and the nature of events. A good case study explicitly
identifies alternative explanations, lays out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reasoning</ENAMEX>, and makes clear which conclusions rest primarily on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>' insightful recognition of patterns of evidence and
which have been recognized in other ways.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. What is known about the competence and
impartiality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>? A good case study
provides information about the experience of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
with case study methods and what they have written previously about
the questions that were answered. The more evidence there is that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have had appropriate training in case
Appendix III <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guidelines for Reviewing Case Study Reports</ENAMEX>
study methods, and that they have addressed related issues in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> that seem impartial and are intended to reduce bias, the
greater confidence the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> can have in the quality of the work.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reports, the job documentation should contain evidence that
the evaluation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> as a group possessed the skills required and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> that there were no impediments to impartiality among
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team members</ENAMEX>. For others' reports we plan to use in our
studies, we should seek similar assurance in a report itself or
from knowledgable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>.



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
Are comments on the draft report available?

Perhaps because case studies require more detail than other
methods, case study reports are sometimes criticized for failing to
be convincing about their impartiality. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way that a good case
study counters this criticism is by the inclusion of a technical
appendix that gives the full comments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">informants</ENAMEX> who
reviewed the draft.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
Is there adequate information for judging


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">generalizability</ENAMEX>? The basis for claiming generalizability is
explicit in a good case study. It provides the evidence, of
whatever type and detail, that is needed for assessing this claim.
In a good case study, generalizations do not exceed the basis for
these, considering program diversity and how the cases studies were
selected.
We provide a checklist of the guidelines discussed in this

Glossary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Backfill Techniques Techniques</ENAMEX> used in cumulative case studies
to collect information needed if the study is to be usable for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX>; these techniques include, for example, obtaining
missing information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> on how instances studied were
identified and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> for instance selection.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bias</ENAMEX> The extent to which a measurement, sampling, or analytic
method systematically underestimates or overestimates the true
value of an attribute.
Case Study A method for learning about a complex instance, based
on a comprehensive understanding of that instance, obtained by
extensive description and analysis of the instance, taken as a
whole and in its context.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convenience Sample Instances</ENAMEX> selected where the only basis is
feasibility or ease of data collection. Rarely useful in evaluation
and is usually hazardous.
Construct An attribute, usually unobservable, such as
educational attainment or socioeconomic status, that is represented
by an observable measure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Construct Validity</ENAMEX> The extent to which a measurement method
accurately represents a construct and produces an observation
distinct from that produced by a measure of another construct.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">External Validity</ENAMEX> The extent to which a finding applies (or can
be generalized) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, objects, settings, or times other than
those that were the subject of study.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Validity</ENAMEX> The extent to which the causes of an effect
are established by an inquiry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longitudinal Data</ENAMEX> Sometimes called "time series data,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX> collected over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of time</TIMEX>; the sample (instances
or cases) may or may not be the same each time.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix of Categories</ENAMEX> A method of displaying relationships among
themes in analyzing case study data that shows whether changes in
categories or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">degrees</NUMEX> along <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dimension are associated with
changes in the categories of another dimension.
Normative Question A type of evaluation question requiring
comparison between what is happening (the condition) to norms and
expectations or standards for what should be happening (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">criterion</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Open-Ended Interview</ENAMEX>
An interview in which, after an initial or lead question,
subsequent questions are determined by topics brought up by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person being</ENAMEX> interviewed; the concerns discussed, their sequence,
and specific information obtained are not predetermined and the
discussion is unconstrained, able to move in unexpected
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Outliers Instances</ENAMEX> that are aberrant or do not fit with other
instances; instances that, compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, are at the extremes on relevant dimensions.
Program Effectiveness Evaluation
The application of scientific research methods to estimate how
much observed results, intended or not, are caused by program
activities. Effect is linked to cause by design and analyses that
compare observed results with estimates of what might have been
observed in the absence of the program.
Program Evaluation The application of scientific research
methods to assess program concepts, implementation, and
effectiveness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purposive Sample Instances</ENAMEX> appropriately selected to answer
different evaluation questions, on various systematic bases, such
as best or worst practices; a judgmental sample. If conducted
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">systematically</ENAMEX>, can be widely useful in evaluation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qualitative Data</ENAMEX>
Information based on judgments (such as the estimated speed of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">UFO</ENAMEX>) which may be expressed in numerical or nonnumerical ways and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> that may not be based on judgments (such as state of birth)
but are not meaningfully expressed numerically. The data sources
are often textual and observational and expressed in words.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantitative Data Information</ENAMEX> based on measures that do not rely
on judgments and that are meaningfully measured. These are usually
expressed numerically and often use continuous rather than discrete
or categorical levels

of measurement and scales with interval or ratio properties.
Reliability The extent to which a measurement process produces
similar results on repeated observations of the same condition or
event.
Representative A sample that has approximately the same
distribution of characteristics as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from
Sample
which it was drawn.
Simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX> A method for drawing a sample from a population
such that all samples of a given size have equal
Sample
probability of being drawn.
Structured Interview An interview in which questions to be
asked, their sequence, and the detailed information to be gathered
are all predetermined; used where maximum consistency across
interviews and interviewees is needed.
Triangulation
The combination of methodologies in the study of the same
phenomenon or construct; a method of establishing the accuracy of
information by comparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more types of independent points
of view on data <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> (for example, interviews, observation, and
documentation; different investigations; different times) bearing
on the same findings. Akin to corroboration and an essential
methodological feature of case studies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yoked Concurrent with</ENAMEX>. For example, data collection and analyses
in case studies are iterative and concurrent-that is, are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yoked</ENAMEX>.
