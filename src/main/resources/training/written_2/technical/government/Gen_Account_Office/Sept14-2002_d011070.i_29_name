Dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voinovich</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> are the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s most valuable asset in
managing for results, and you have emphasized the importance of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empowering</ENAMEX> and involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> achieve their
goals and improve government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. As our studies of private
and public sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have shown, high-performing
organizations focus on valuing and investing in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>--human capital--and on aligning their "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> policies"
to support organizational performance goals. However, strategic
human capital management is a pervasive challenge in the federal
government, and is one of the governmentwide areas that we have
identified as high risk<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>
In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX>'s emphasis on workforce planning
and restructuring will require federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to examine how they
can flatten their organizational hierarchy and improve their work
processes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 8, 2001</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bulletin</ENAMEX> called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to use workforce planning to
redistribute higher-level positions to front-line, service delivery
positions that interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>.2 Effective workforce
planning and restructuring efforts will build upon implementation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Performance and Results Act of 1993</ENAMEX> (GPRA) to
address results-oriented goals, improve performance, and assure
accountability. To optimize the provision of services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>,
it is crucial that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> understand the connection between
their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> work activities and the results their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
seek to achieve.

At your request, this report examines selected experiences <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have had in implementing practices that helped empower or
involve frontline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. Our objectives were to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) identify
and provide examples of the key practices <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> used to empower
and involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) identify some of the barriers that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
experienced and strategies they used to address them, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
provide examples of reported performance improvements from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empowering</ENAMEX> and involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. As agreed, we have examined
selected employee empowerment and involvement practices at specific
components within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>), the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Personnel Management</ENAMEX> (OPM), and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Veteran</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benefits Administration</ENAMEX> (VBA). The practices we examined
at specific agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> were selected from those initiatives
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> identified that had, in their view, successfully
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empowered</ENAMEX> and involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we reviewed used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> key
practices in the initiatives that

we reviewed to empower and involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> used them.

•
Demonstrating top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> commitment. Top leadership
commitment is crucial in instilling a common vision across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> and creating an environment that is receptive to
innovation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency organizations</ENAMEX> we reviewed
envisioned needed changes, communicated openly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, and
instituted organizational changes. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Logistics Center</ENAMEX> decided that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> needed to operate more
like a private sector business. He met in open forums with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to discuss his vision and, with the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and
union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, reorganized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>.


•
Engaging employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>. Effective labor-management
relations help to achieve consensus and solve problems
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expeditiously</ENAMEX>. In some cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> participated in
predecisional discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> before changes
were implemented. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> involved its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> in
pre-decisional discussions about proposed new policies.


•
Training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to enhance their knowledge, skills,
and abilities. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provided formal or on-the-job
training to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to support the changes that were being made.
For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> provided on-the-job cross training to a retirement
processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> could adjudicate retirement claims
under both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Service Retirement System</ENAMEX> (CSRS) and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Employees' Retirement System</ENAMEX> (FERS).


•
Using employee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to help accomplish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> missions.
All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to help accomplish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> missions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teams</ENAMEX> helped flatten <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> by merging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and
enhanced flexibility in meeting job demands. For example, VBA
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> created self-directed employee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and merged
divisions to process veterans' benefits claims from beginning to
end. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> learned new skills and had more flexibility to
help each other accomplish tasks.


•
Involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in planning and sharing performance
information. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to varying degrees in
planning and shared performance information with them. For example,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> division used an employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to help develop its
strategic plan and shared performance information. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> shared performance information was by
posting performance data in charts, graphs, and tables throughout
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> could see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>'s progress toward
achieving organizational goals.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Delegating authorities</ENAMEX> to front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX>
at each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had been delegated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. In some
instances <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were formally authorized to approve specified
dollar levels of program assistance or procurements. For example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>'s public assistance coordinators were authorized to approve up
to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> in financial assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> adversely affected
by natural disasters or other emergencies. In other instances,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were provided new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to make decisions
related to their work processes, workloads, training needs, and
work schedules.


For the initiatives we reviewed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> undertook changes
that represented a significant shift from their traditional
operations and, as such, encountered organizational and cultural
barriers that needed to be overcome as they sought to empower and
involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. These barriers included a lack of trust,
resistance to change and lack of buy-in
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1070</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Capital</ENAMEX>
from front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, and a variety of
implementation issues, such as workload demands. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
developed strategies to address these barriers, such as maintaining
open communication and reassigning and hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> adapted to the changes at their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> over time,
particularly once they perceived benefits, such as improved
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>, from the new practices.
In implementing the practices to empower and involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> identified a range of examples to demonstrate the
performance improvements these efforts have accomplished.
Performance improvements cited included increased efficiency and
improved customer satisfaction. For example, operating as a team
has allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> to substantially reduce the time
needed to make emergency radar repairs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> generally agreed with the contents of
this report. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> did not comment on the report.



Background
No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> issue facing federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> could be more
critical to their ability to serve the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> than their
approach to strategic human capital management, including
attracting, retaining, and motivating their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
High-performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in the private and public sectors
have long understood the relationship between effective "people
management" and organizational success. However, the federal
government, which has often acted as if federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were
costs to be cut rather than assets to be valued, has only recently
received its wake-up call. As our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Performance</ENAMEX> and
Accountability Series reports made clear, serious federal human
capital shortfalls are now eroding the ability of many federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>-and threatening the ability of others-to economically,
efficiently, and effectively perform their missions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> The problem
lies not with federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> themselves, but with the lack of
effective leadership and management, along with the lack of a
strategic approach to marshaling, managing, and maintaining the
human capital needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to discharge its
responsibilities and deliver on its promises<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> we reviewed have experienced challenges
in managing their human capital. Each has implemented management
changes in response to the challenges they face, including
implementing strategies to empower and involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> faces challenges, including the need to enhance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and teamwork, and to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with the
training and skills they need to operate effectively. For example,
we have reported on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s implementation of management reforms,
including delegating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, to improve its
rulemaking processes<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> In our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX> report on aviation
rulemaking we recommended, among other things, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Administrator</ENAMEX> take steps to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) empower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> by giving them
the authority to coordinate with the associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>
(which would eliminate a separate review and approval step), (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)

At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> we identified the challenges the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> faces in
revamping its human capital policies to help achieve its
congressionally mandated transformation to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that better
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">balances</ENAMEX> service to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> with enforcement of the tax
laws<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> has made major changes to modernize its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
operations and comply with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRS Restructuring and Reform Act</ENAMEX> of
1998.7 These changes present major management challenges and will
require considerable time to successfully implement them, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are still learning how to work effectively
in the new environment. In revamping its performance management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, for example, we reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>' new system is weakest at
the front line, where interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> occur<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> However,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> is conducting customer satisfaction
surveys to enhance its knowledge about what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> can do to
better meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>' needs.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> faces challenges in processing veterans' benefit claims
accurately and in a timely manner. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its fiscal year 2000</TIMEX>
performance report, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Administration</ENAMEX> reported that
performance declined with respect to its rating-related
claims-processing timeliness and national accuracy rate. Among the
reasons it cited for this decline was underestimating how long it
would take to realize the impact of initiatives such as increased
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staffing</ENAMEX> and improved training<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> We reported that many experienced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">claims-processing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> are expected to retire and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s
training and recruitment programs may not be adequate to ensure a
sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> of competent claims processors<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> VBA
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us that, in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> we raised that
many of the training modules might not be available in time to
train new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> has stepped up implementation of its plans
to use a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Training</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Performance Support System</ENAMEX> (TPSS)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is intended to provide standardized training to new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who will replace the wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> expected to retire
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several years</TIMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, they are
currently using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TPSS</ENAMEX> training modules to facilitate the training of
some new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, but the training modules needed for other newly
hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> will not be available until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2001</TIMEX>. In the
interim, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> is using a web-based "field guide" to train those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. The field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> uses a variety of delivery mechanisms
including satellite broadcasts, video teleconferencing and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centralized</ENAMEX> and localized classroom instruction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> also faces special mission-related challenges, including
providing timely responses to disaster aid requests, preventing or
reducing harm and losses from future disasters through
cost-effective mitigation efforts, and working effectively with
other federal, state, and local programs. To address its strategic
human capital management challenges, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> has started an initiative
to reduce middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> layers and streamline its

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scope And Methodology</ENAMEX>
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> we report on-OPM-downsized significantly during

significantly since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> plans to modernize its
retirement systems. This modernization is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s central strategy to
meet the long-term customer service and financial management
objectives for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERS</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its fiscal year 2002</TIMEX> performance
plan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> reported that, beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>, it will
phase in a new business model for retirement claims
processing<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>
To meet our objectives, we asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to
identify initiatives they had that empowered or involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
From the inventories of the initiatives they developed in response
to our request, we asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to identify those agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> and initiatives that, in their view, had successfully
involved and empowered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. We sought to identify practices
that were commonly implemented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 5</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. In some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> focused our attention on practices
that began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>.
We interviewed agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">front-line</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, and union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to discuss how
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> had implemented these practices to empower and involve
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, and we analyzed related documents and information they
provided. We did not attempt to verify the performance data that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provided.
We included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> in our review because it has certain exemptions
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Acquisition Regulations</ENAMEX> designed to facilitate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delegating</ENAMEX> procurement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to lower levels. We included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> in our review, given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>' exemption from certain title 5
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">personnel</ENAMEX> provisions and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s human capital leadership role in the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> were selected because a literature
review of relevant articles indicated that front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
from those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had been empowered or involved in key agency
decisions or operations.
Because we were seeking to review initiatives that had
successfully empowered and involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, we asked
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to identify organizational components for

designed to provide examples that could be considered
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of all the employee empowerment and involvement
initiatives at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> reviewed or the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in
general.
We conducted our work from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000 through August 2001</TIMEX> in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> we reviewed implemented key empowerment and
involvement practices as part of making organizational changes
intended to realign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and processes to improve
performance. The practices were (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) demonstrating top leadership
commitment; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) engaging employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> in making changes; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to enhance their knowledge, skills, and
abilities; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) using employee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to help accomplish agency

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frontline</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Demonstrating Top Leadership</ENAMEX>
Commitment
Top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> commitment is crucial in developing a vision,
initiating organizational change, maintaining open communications,
and creating an environment that is receptive to innovation. In
earlier reports and testimonies, we observed that top leadership
must play a critical role in creating and sustaining
high-performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Without the clear and demonstrated
commitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, organizational cultures will
not be transformed, and new visions and ways of doing business will
not take root<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.14</NUMEX>
Consistent attention to employee empowerment and involvement
issues helps to ensure that changes are sustained. Agency leaders
need to commit their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to valuing and investing in
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> by empowering, involving, and providing them the
tools to do their best, and by implementing the modern performance
management and incentives systems needed to focus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>'
efforts on achieving agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and goals. Top leadership
commitment entails time, energy, and persistence in providing
incentives and establishing accountability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> must
commit their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to valuing and investing in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and focusing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' efforts on achieving stated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency missions</ENAMEX> and goals<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> While top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> commitment can be
demonstrated in many ways, the following are examples <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> identified for the selected initiatives we reviewed at
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
• Think strategically about areas where innovation would make
good business sense. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX> conceptualized new approaches to
improve performance and engaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in shaping
the implementation of that vision. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> saw the need for operating more like a
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector business</ENAMEX> and envisioned the organizational and
operational changes that would be required to do that. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> helped to ensure that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> his vision by discussing proposed changes with his top-level
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and by meeting with front-line

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to obtain their input about
potential changes.


•
Reorganize and integrate operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX> implemented
their visions by realigning their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to improve
performance and increase the coordination of mission-related
activities. For example, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s Retirement and
Insurance Service enabled a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to improve claims processing
by, among other things, providing cross-training for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to
handle both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERS</ENAMEX> claims.


•
Create an environment of trust and honest communication.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX> made themselves available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, promoted
open and constructive dialog, and were receptive to ideas and
suggestions from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at all levels. Following an approach to
change management that is transparent and highly participatory is a
key element in involving and empowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. For example,
several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> held <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>-hall meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to
discuss workplace issues and provide a forum for input and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feedback</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> said that they felt that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> used
the information they provided about proposed changes.


•
Target investments and provide incentives to facilitate
change.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX> provided funding and created financial and other
incentives to support new ways of working and to encourage
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to attain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' goals and objectives. For
example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Logistics Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> committed to providing
every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500</NUMEX> cash award if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> met all of its performance targets for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>. At
the time of our review, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> was on track to meet
or exceed its goals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">• Participate</ENAMEX> in efforts to benchmark successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that were models for
enhancing organizational flexibility and maintaining quality
standards. By visiting and benchmarking model performance
practices, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> demonstrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> their personal
commitment to making the changes needed for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> or units
to become high-performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.16 For example, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> visited several private sector
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> to observe how they processed claims and ensured
accuracy. The insights gained were factored into the changes made
in regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> claims operations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benchmarking</ENAMEX> is a critical part of an effective improvement
program because it helps an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> identify outstanding
levels of performance that have actually been achieved.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benchmarking</ENAMEX> therefore helps define specific reference points for
setting goals for improving performance. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managing</ENAMEX> for Results:
Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Actions for Measuring Performance</ENAMEX> 
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/T-GGD/AIMD-95-187</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 20, 1995</TIMEX>).

• Use a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree performance feedback system. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> used
input from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s performance. An OPM
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> who supervises the cross-trained claims processing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> implemented <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 360</TIMEX>-degree feedback system for assessing both
her and her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' performance. Under that system, team
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> provide her with input on her performance as a team coach
as well as input on the performance of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. She then
uses that information for self-assessment and in providing
performance feedback to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team members</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engaging Employee Unions</ENAMEX> Involving employee
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, as well as involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> directly, is crucial to
achieving success. Major changes can involve redesigning work
processes, changing work rules, developing new job descriptions,
establishing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">new work hours</TIMEX>, or making other changes to the work
environment that are of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>.
Obtaining union cooperation and support through effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">labormanagement</ENAMEX> relations can help achieve consensus on the planned
changes, avoid misunderstandings, and more expeditiously resolve
problems that occur. The following are examples of how agencies
engaged employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>.


•
Develop and maintain an ongoing working relationship with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agencies</ENAMEX> worked cooperatively with employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> and
found that an ongoing relationship enhanced communication. For
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> maintained a continuous dialog through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> meetings
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to share information and
address workplace issues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retirement Operations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boyers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Federation of Government</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> (AFGE) said that their excellent working relationship
helped facilitate the adjustments made to incorporate new
technology at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>. They said when new technology reduced the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>'s need for file <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> and management officials
worked together to ensure that affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> received advance
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> about upcoming changes, training in new skills, and
information about available job opportunities.


•
Document formal agreements. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies</ENAMEX> had formal
agreements to serve as a foundation setting forth the manner in
which labor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> would work together. For example, the
agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Treasury Employees Union</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTEU</ENAMEX>) was designed to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are adequately
represented and informed of proposed new policies and have input
into the proposals.




Training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> to Enhance Their
Knowledge, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Skills</ENAMEX>, and Abilities
The agreement also provides for continuous improvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>
operations in part by providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> the authority, resources,
and other inputs they need to effect changes and to be accountable
for performing effectively, and provides for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTEU</ENAMEX> participation in
various forums, such as business process improvement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>.


•
Build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> over time. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have undertaken a
long-term effort to create an environment of trust and openness in
working cooperatively with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>. For example, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and NTEU
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> credited the excellent working relationship they
developed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> for helping to reorganize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> stated that the reorganization has resulted in
operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> that are focused on serving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> and
flatter decision-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> with clear end-to-end
accountability. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTEU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> was willing
to expedite some negotiations on mission-critical issues because a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trusting</ENAMEX> relationship had developed and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> felt that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> used the information they provided in shaping the new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>.



•
Participate jointly in making decisions. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Agencies</ENAMEX>
involved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> and incorporated their input into proposals before
finalizing decisions. For example, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> provided
suggestions about how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should share performance information
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. In another instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations Center</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFGE</ENAMEX> worked jointly on predecisional matters, such as the hiring of
a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations Center</ENAMEX>.

Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> viewed training as a critical
factor in learning how to work in new and different ways. To
improve customer service, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> may need new skills, such as
the ability to analyze and improve work processes or the ability to
work effectively together on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. In addition to job-specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and work processes, training in teamwork and communications
and encouragement and coaching through mentoring and networking can
help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> adapt to new ways of working that involve changes in
their roles and job expectations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, for instance, told
us that, along with providing various training modules, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
also need on-the-job training, coaching and mentoring to enhance
their expertise through actual experience in processing claims. The
following are examples of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in new
processes.


•
Provide a mix of on-the-job and formal training. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Agencies</ENAMEX>
used a variety of training techniques to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> adjust to
organizational and operational changes. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> provided
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">on-the-job</ENAMEX> cross training so that a claims processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> could
adjudicate both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERS</ENAMEX> claims. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Branch</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX>, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> received cross-training, it was able to
help another division reduce its backlog of FERS cases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> also
provided formal training to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> in how to make decisions in
setting goals, planning and assigning work, and scheduling overtime
and training.

Provide training on building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> relationships and new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> of working. When making significant changes to their
operations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provided training to help facilitate change.
For example, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> undertook a major reorganization, its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ogden</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Center</ENAMEX> trained its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the new ways of
conducting business. The training workshops included (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) learning
how effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> function;



(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
improving working relationships among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stewards</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) enhancing effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, union <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stewards</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>;


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
increasing discussions about ways to improve work
processes and meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>' needs; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) creating a more
positive workplace environment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> we interviewed said
that training on effective working relationships was especially
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX> because they got to know their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> and gained an
appreciation for each others' views.




•
Commit sufficient funding and time to training. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Agencies</ENAMEX>
considered training needs in budget decisions and their workforce
planning. For example, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> was being
reorganized to operate in a more businesslike manner, it trained
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> about the need for, as well as on how to develop, quality
work processes. This enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to document information that
was required for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> to receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standardization</ENAMEX> (ISO) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9000</TIMEX> certification for
quality work processes<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX> To receive this certification, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> must show that it has standardized, high-quality
processes that result in products and services that are provided in
a timely manner.


17ISO is a worldwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">federation</ENAMEX> of national standards bodies
representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISO</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9000</TIMEX> certification recognizes
standardized quality processes established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to
produce consistently high-quality products or services.

Using <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Employee Teams To Help Accomplish</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency Missions</ENAMEX>
Adopting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>-based approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> can improve
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> morale and job satisfaction by creating an environment
characterized by open communication, enhanced flexibility in
meeting job demands, and a sense of shared responsibility for
accomplishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> goals and objectives. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> can also
assist in integrating different perspectives, flattening
organizational structure, and streamlining operations. In a prior
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> report on best practices, we said that commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> began
using integrated product <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> as a way to get better
results faster<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> An integrated product <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is a concentration of
product expertise within a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who, together, have
the authority to design, develop, test, manufacture, and deliver a
product. In examining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s efforts to modernize its air traffic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> systems, we stated that although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has identified an
integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> approach as key to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s efforts to deploy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> that meet performance goals, major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> still tended to
function in stovepipes that inhibit an integrated team
approach<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX>
The following are examples of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were used in the agency
initiatives we reviewed.
• Create <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who represent multiple
organizational functions and different grade levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Agencies</ENAMEX>
flattened their organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> by including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
from various organizational functions and grade levels on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>.
For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> consolidated regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> operations by merging
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and creating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from both functions
who could process claims from beginning to end. In some cases,
forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> provided opportunities for front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to
assume leadership roles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Fire</ENAMEX>
Administration provided opportunities for front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to
lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> included a mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervisors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies</ENAMEX> also took steps to streamline their processes
by using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> approach. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> streamlined its claims
process by allowing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> to handle all aspects of a claim,
instead of requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to write referrals and wait for
responses from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> approach also

enhanced accountability to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were
responsible for handling specific claims.


•
Establish an integrated working environment with common
goals. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, this provided an
environment in which individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team members</ENAMEX> were encouraged to
work together toward achieving team goals. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> throughout the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> met on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> basis and identified ways
to implement over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">170</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Visitors</ENAMEX> recommendations for
improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Administration</ENAMEX>'s operations. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>
facilitated communications and employee involvement by maintaining
a focal point for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, working toward consensus, and
posting performance data showing progress toward addressing these
recommendations.


•
Assign team responsibilities and provide an environment
for learning. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> assigned a broad range of responsibilities
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to help each other and learn new
skills. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s claims-processing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were responsible
for controlling claims from when first received until finally
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjudicated</ENAMEX>. That required the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to conduct a full range of
claims functions, including receiving and controlling the claims,
contacting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> to obtain information, and making
benefit decisions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were able to assist other team
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> when needed, which helped develop team <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>' skills in
functions they did not previously perform. To enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to
efficiently meet their objectives, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were also responsible
for setting their work schedules and managing their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workload</ENAMEX>.


•
Hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> accountable for results. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> held
teams accountable for accomplishing their work, and working
together in a team environment encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team members</ENAMEX> to share
accountability. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> made decisions about how to do their
work, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> told us they felt greater accountability for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>' overall performance. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX>'s integrated product <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were accountable for
all aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>'s products, including maintenance,
repair, storage, and shipping. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>' performance was measured
on a regular basis, providing direct feedback to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>.




Involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning</ENAMEX> and
Sharing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Performance Information</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">• Physically</ENAMEX> collocate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> when appropriate. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Agencies</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collocated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> had been working in the
same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. Although technology is being used to
help bring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that are geographically dispersed together in a
virtual environment, to the extent that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are already
located nearby, moving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to a shared location improved
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and enhanced efficiency<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> For example, collocating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> facilitated the sharing of
information among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and led to improved work processes and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction.
Involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in planning and sharing performance
information can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> understand what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is
trying to accomplish and how it is progressing in that direction.
Involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the planning process helps to develop agency
goals and objectives that incorporate insights about operations
from a front-line perspective, as well as increases <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>'
understanding and acceptance of organizational goals and
objectives. Involving front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the goal-setting
process also helps create a clear "line of sight" throughout the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> so that everyone understands what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is
trying to achieve and the goals it seeks to reach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> we met
with appeared committed to working toward the goals of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> and to providing high quality service.
20 Advances in the use of information technology and the
Internet are continuing to change the way federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">communicate</ENAMEX>, use, and disseminate information, deliver services,
and conduct business. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Government</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Challenges Must Be</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Addressed With Effective Leadership</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management</ENAMEX> ( 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">959T</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 11, 2001</TIMEX>).

Sharing performance information can provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with a
more meaningful perspective about how their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> activities
contribute toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s goals and objectives. Sharing
performance information also allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> to provide clearer
and more specific feedback to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on
their expectations, progress, and performance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX>' use of
performance information can be improved. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX>, we reported
that, based on a survey of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, at no
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 7</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> surveyed did <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> or more of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> respond that they used performance information to a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> or very great extent<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX> However, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> we visited,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> used performance information and shared this information
with front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> through various mechanisms. Some of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, used a balanced scorecard approach,
which is intended to provide a balanced perspective regarding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> results, customer satisfaction, and employee feedback. At
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, for example, computerized
information is continuously displayed on video screens providing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with current performance information.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> we met with were aware of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' and
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>' performance goals and objectives, and they said that
sharing performance information had enhanced communications across
all levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> told us that sharing
performance information provided everyone with a focus to work
toward and a status report on their progress. They also said that
sharing performance information generated more performance-related
discussions, including at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>-hall meetings, other meetings with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, and during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> meetings.
The following are examples of how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in
planning and sharing performance information.
• Create mechanisms to involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the planning
process.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> used various mechanisms to develop strategic plans,
gather feedback from internal stakeholders for identifying gaps in
existing strategic plans, and obtain employee input and feedback.
For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> division used an employee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to help to
develop its strategic plan. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> ensured that all division
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> had opportunities to

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delegating Authorities</ENAMEX> to Front-line
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX>
provide input, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> used that input as part of its
efforts to develop a balanced set of goals and objectives for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">• Post</ENAMEX> performance information throughout the workplace.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies</ENAMEX> shared performance information with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> by
posting it through a variety of means, including charts, graphs,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">newsletters</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> intranet postings. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> posted performance charts and graphs in the entry
foyers of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and at the entrances to its organizational
units. Such postings permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to easily see how their
units' performance was contributing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> goals and objectives.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> also had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> newsletter for sharing
organizational performance information and providing an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to share information.


•
Share performance information in meetings. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Agencies</ENAMEX>
frequently held <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and other meetings to discuss program
performance and organizational issues. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>-hall
meetings to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> better understand how their work efforts
contributed to overall organizational success. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>-hall
meetings also provided a forum in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
could discuss organizational changes and suggest operational
improvements. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
we interviewed said that for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time regular and effective
communications between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> was occurring.
They said that, in addition to listening, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> were taking
action on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' suggestions, which made the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> see that
their input was valued. Frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> meetings provided <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
an opportunity to obtain feedback about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> performance. For
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> shared performance information at weekly
meetings, information that helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> assess their progress
in meeting performance goals.


•
Survey <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on their views regarding organizational
direction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> used surveys to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' views, such
as input regarding the direction of organizational changes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wage and Investment Operating Division</ENAMEX> surveyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on the
strengths, opportunities, and priorities for each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX>, shared survey results with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, and implemented
changes as a result.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Delegating authorities</ENAMEX> to front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> involves the
transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who are
closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> and provide services and information as part of
their day-to-day activities. Providing delegated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> can
enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to control their own work processes and schedules.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Delegating authorities</ENAMEX> also gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> the opportunity to look
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> needs in an integrated way
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1070</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Capital</ENAMEX>
and effectively respond to those needs. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Delegating authorities</ENAMEX>
can benefit agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> by streamlining processes.
Furthermore, delegating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> gives
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> greater opportunities to concentrate on problems or
policy-level issues. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> believe they have the authority
to tackle goals and objectives beyond their formal job descriptions
and assigned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, then when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> have legitimate complaints,
empowered front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> can "make it right" immediately
rather than having to wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to get involved.
The following are examples of how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> delegated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>
to frontline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agencies delegated authorities</ENAMEX> and empowered front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
to exercise responsibilities to more fully address <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> needs.
For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> public assistance coordinators are on-site at the
disaster or emergency to observe the conditions and to coordinate
public assistance. They were delegated the authority to determine
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>' eligibility, to approve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $100,000</NUMEX> in public
financial assistance, and to help to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> are
kept fully informed throughout the public assistance
process.


•
Eliminate layers of review. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> reduced the number
of approvals needed for various activities and delegated greater
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> to front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to make decisions. For example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeronautical Center</ENAMEX> delegated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to its audiovisual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to make decisions while on location, such as the need to
visit locations in addition to those originally planned and
approved. This allowed the audiovisual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to more efficiently
meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> needs. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>, delegating authority to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assistance Coordinators</ENAMEX> eliminated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional state reviews of
applications for assistance and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other reviews by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>.


•
Provide more time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to focus on problem areas
or policy matters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>' skills on more
difficult problems or policy areas by delegating some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>
to front-line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said they were
able to use their time more efficiently after delegating day-to-day
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">claims-processing authorities</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. They said that by
delegating these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, they could concentrate on policy
matters and more difficult problems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were unable to
handle.


•
Establish a new position with appropriate authority. Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> identified situations in which new positions of authority
could help benefit operations. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>, as part of its
efforts to





<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agencies Addressed Barriers To</ENAMEX> Efforts
That <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empowered And Involved Employees</ENAMEX>
reengineer its claims processing, established a new decision
review <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> position and provided <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in those positions
the authority to review and change claims decisions that veterans
appealed. Prior to this, veterans' appeals were addressed under a
formal hearing process. Because decision review <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> have more
flexibility to address appeals informally, creating this new
position provided the opportunity to streamline the process and
save time.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> we reviewed undertook changes that represented a
significant shift from their traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and, as such,
encountered organizational and cultural barriers that needed to be
overcome as they sought to empower and involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. Some of
the barriers included a lack of trust, resistance to change and a
lack of buy-in, and implementation issues. Despite encountering
these barriers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> we met at each of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> perceived benefits from the employee empowerment and
involvement practices that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had implemented. To
address the barriers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> used such strategies as open
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>, a commitment to change, and providing performance
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feedback</ENAMEX>.
All of these efforts entailed cultural transformations, and
therefore there was some natural resistance that took time and
effort to overcome. Nevertheless, the experiences of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> can make progress in addressing
barriers to empower and involve their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. The following are
some examples of the barriers encountered and the strategies used
to address them.
Lack of Trust The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> identified a
lack of trust as a barrier they experienced in their efforts to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">empower</ENAMEX> and involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. A lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> can frustrate agency
attempts to implement major changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' day-to-day
working environment. Throughout our review, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> continuously emphasized the importance of trust in
gaining acceptance for changes. For example, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> feared
for their job security as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> began to implement
more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> like operations. However, they told us that they
learned to trust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> as they recognized
the need for the changes.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were skeptical that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> would listen to
their input for planning purposes. They were also concerned that
performance data

Resistance to Change and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lack</ENAMEX> of
Buy-in
would be used to justify punitive actions, rather than to
increase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' understanding about the direction of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s performance. In addition, working in a more open
environment requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to trust and help each other, which
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> said initially was a barrier to working as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>.
Maintaining an open door policy that encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to share
their views and demonstrating a vision and commitment to change
were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> used to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX>.
Another barrier that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> experienced was resistance to
change and a lack of buy-in. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> resisted making
changes because they had to work in new and unfamiliar ways. Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> found it difficult to transition from working under
direct supervision to working on a team with little direct
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX>. For example, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, some team
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> continued to seek <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and guidance from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>,
did not trust other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and were reluctant to speak out
in the team environment until they eventually adjusted to working
in a team environment.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
found it difficult to operate in a new environment of more open
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and feedback. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> were
reluctant to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to have delegated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in areas
such as budgeting, procurement, and time and attendance report
approval. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeronautical Center</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with
contracting responsibilities were initially uncomfortable
exercising newly delegated procurement authority to purchase goods
or services up to a certain dollar amount without supervisory
approval. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> said that they gained confidence as they
became more experienced in exercising the new authority, and some
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who initially resisted changes
adjusted to them gradually over time. In some cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> we
visited made managerial and supervisory changes when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
were unable to adjust to a more open work environment.
A lack of buy-in resulted in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> being
reluctant to fully participate in training. They tended to view the
changes being made as another "flavor-of-the<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-month</TIMEX>" initiative.
Thus, they were not as open to receiving new information or
adopting new ways of working. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> provided an example of a solution
to this barrier. To encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to buy into team concept
training, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> has decided to train section <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> who will then
train <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in their work units.


Implementation Issues
Implementation issues, such as workload demands and performance
incentive issues, also presented barriers to change. Although
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> generally appreciated the changes made to work in a team
environment, high workload demands affected some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>'
ability to exercise their delegated authority. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>, for example,
has a large, and growing, backlog of compensation and pension
claims. 22 Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had the authority to set their
schedules and determine their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> work priorities, heavy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workload</ENAMEX> demands prevented them from being able to plan and manage
their work. Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s decision review <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> also told us
that their ability to exercise their delegated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> had been
limited by the claims-processing backlogs.
Another implementation issue that affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> involved the
incentives that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> to encourage
performance. For example, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> said that working on teams
was demotivating when poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> obtained an equal share of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> rewards. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said that not enough
money was available for rewarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that met
their goals and objectives. Such issues were commonly addressed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> meetings and in individual performance feedback.
The timing of training was another implementation issue that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> cited as a barrier. For example, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> told us
that it would have been helpful if they had received training
before being reorganized into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, rather than after. Because
training was not provided prior to moving to a team environment,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were immediately faced with the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to
take time off of the front lines for training and skill <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
Providing training at the appropriate time for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> can
achieve better results.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> The accurate and timely processing of compensation and
pension claims is one of the major management challenges we have
identified at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Veterans Affairs</ENAMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Major</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agencies Cited</ENAMEX>

performance can be improved in
implementing the practices to empower and involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. As we
have reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">before</TIMEX> when looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Performance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> reform
efforts, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of
numerous initiatives and external factors that affect each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency'sImprovements</ENAMEX> environment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX> For example, external factors
such as legislative changes
that resulted in reopening <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 100,000</NUMEX> veterans' claims and
the
increasing complexity of these claims have affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX>'s
results in
addressing its claims backlog.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> attributed improved operations
to the employee empowerment and involvement initiatives they had
implemented, and the specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> we visited had achieved
successes in implementing the practices we reviewed in this report.
Therefore, these examples are presented to illustrate how
performance can improve through the contributions of empowered and
involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">• FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center Radar Product Division</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> addressed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emergencies</ENAMEX>, as well as routine tasks, more quickly. Established in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX> is an integrated product <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> and electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX>, who perform all of the
functions required to repair ground-based radar systems. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> surveillance radar at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> was
ripped from its mounting pedestal during severe weather conditions,
severely reducing the number of flights in and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Airport</ENAMEX>. Working together, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, along with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and
non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, made extensive repairs and restored radar
service within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">58 hours</TIMEX> after the incident. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>, a
similar problem occurred at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, and the team
restored service within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">56 hours</TIMEX>.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logistics Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, prior to working as an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> product <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, it required longer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> to coordinate a
response to similar emergencies and fully restore service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said
that collocating all of the logistics functions including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Engineers</ENAMEX>, Items <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technicians, Equipment Specialists</ENAMEX>, etc,
allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to work together on priority areas. Collocation
also eliminated communication barriers, such as the need to write

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>'s customer surveys show improved satisfaction.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>, one of its goals was to transform the public
assistance program into a customer-driven and performance-based
program, thereby improving the quality and delivery of service to
state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>. Customer surveys conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>
after each disaster where public assistance was provided showed
that customer satisfaction has improved. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fiscal year 2000</TIMEX> survey
results showed that

<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.6 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were satisfied with the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s retirement claims processing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> helped another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retirement and Insurance Service</ENAMEX> reduce a backlog
of retirement claims. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2000</TIMEX>, there was a backlog of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12,000</NUMEX> FERS retirement claims, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s management
instituted a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-point plan to address this problem. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
components of the plan was to provide an existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of CSRS
benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> with cross training in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERS</ENAMEX> claims
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjudication</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s flexibility, attitude, and
work ethic played a significant role in the success of this effort,
which was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cross-training initiative. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPM</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s contribution, along with reallocating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, hiring, and
improved automation, led to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,000</NUMEX> case reduction in the backlog
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> 2001.24


24 As reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its fiscal year 2000</TIMEX> performance report, CSRS
claims processing time increased to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44 days</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 days</TIMEX> in fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1999</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FERS</ENAMEX> processing times increased

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>' Substitute for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Return Authority</ENAMEX> has expedited
taxpayer compliance. In some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are authorized to
prepare substitute tax returns for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> that did not file or
filed a false return. Instead of referring requests to a different
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> as was done in the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> has delegated this authority to
revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>. This allows one-stop case resolution, because the
revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> now maintain complete control of the case through
collection of any balance due. By streamlining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>' processes,
additional taxes are being assessed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 to 8 months</TIMEX>, much
faster than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 months</TIMEX> it usually took before. This also
benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>, because the amount of penalties and interest
added to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> accounts is reduced when assessments are more
timely. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> reported that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a fiscal year 2000</TIMEX> pilot program,
revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> with delegated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> prepared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX> non-filer

When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> established its decision review officer
position, it first used a pilot program to test the new operational
approach at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> locations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VBA</ENAMEX> found that during the pilot phase,
which ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2000</TIMEX>, the number of appeals resolved at

In this report we have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> key practices used in
selected initiatives to help to empower and involve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in
identifying and implementing needed changes. These practices
are


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> Comments


•
providing sustained leadership commitment to open
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> and support culture change,


•
engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> to include all perspectives in achieving
consensus about needed changes,


•
using a variety of formal and on-the-job training
approaches to facilitate the development of new skills,


•
encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to combine their resources and
talents by working together in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>,


•
involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in planning and sharing performance
information so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> help shape <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' goals and better
understand how their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> activities contribute to results,
and


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empowering</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> by giving them the authority they need
to make decisions and effectively conduct agency
operations.


Each federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will need to consider the applicability of
these practices within the context of its own mission, needs, and
culture. Nevertheless, we believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can improve their
performance, enhance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' morale and job satisfaction, and
provide a working environment where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> have a better
understanding of the goals and objectives of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
and how they are contributing to the results that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>
want. We believe that the practices we identified should be
considered by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> as they seek to improve their unique
operations and respond to the challenges they are facing.
