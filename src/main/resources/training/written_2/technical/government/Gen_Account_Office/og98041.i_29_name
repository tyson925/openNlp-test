ENCLOSURE
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS</ENAMEX> UNDER <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 801</NUMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)(i)-(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) OF A MAJOR RULE
ISSUED BY THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES</ENAMEX>, HEALTH
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ORGAN PROCUREMENT</ENAMEX>
AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRANSPLANTATION NETWORK</ENAMEX>" (RIN: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0906-AA32</ENAMEX>)
(i) Cost-benefit analysis
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> performed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Impact Analysis</ENAMEX> which is included in
the preamble to the final rule.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> recognizes in its analysis the difficulty of quantifying the
costs and the benefits of the rule. There is a discussion of the
current costs of transplantation and the analysis concludes that
the final rule will not substantially raise the costs.
Regarding benefits, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> discusses the use of the value of a
statistical life as a quantifying benefit and the fact that, in the
area of transplantation, the usefulness of such a measure is
reduced because of the older average age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> and the
substantial risk of either the graft or the patient not surviving.
Another benefit of the rule is the public oversight and
accountability of the organ transplant system, which will preserve
public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> and confidence. Also, a system of patient-oriented
information of transplant performance will allow easier comparison
of transplant center performance and the use of performance goals
will create equity in the system.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">603-605, 607</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">609</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> has certified that the final rule will not
have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>.
However, because of concern over the effects of changes in
allocation policies on smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX>
considered, as an alternative, the possibility of imposing quality
standards on transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, a voluntary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX> was prepared and is included in the rule's
preamble.
The major portion of the analysis discusses the alternatives
considered and the reasons why required volume or performance
standards for transplant programs and imposing specific allocation
standards focusing on geographic equity were rejected in favor of
the performance standards adopted.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-41</NUMEX>
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the

The final rule, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX>, does not impose a federal
intergovernmental or private sector mandate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> or
more, as defined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
