Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(A) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>,
this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant Health Inspection Service</ENAMEX>, entitled
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Importation of Pork</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>" (RIN: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0579-AA71</ENAMEX>). We
received the rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 7, l997</TIMEX>. It was published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register</ENAMEX> as a final rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 9, 1997</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25439</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant Health Inspection Service</ENAMEX> is amending the
regulations concerning the importation of animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> to allow,
under certain conditions, the importation of fresh, chilled, or
frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of Sonora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> states
that the change is in keeping with provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Trade Agreement</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX>
as it removes unnecessary restrictions on such importation.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s decision to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> a region from which
fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> could be imported with a negligible risk of introducing
or disseminating hog <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX> was based on an analysis of a number
of risk factors detailed in the supplementary information published
with the final rule. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> will require an
authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> to certify that pork
exported from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-43</NUMEX>
not have been in contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> from any region having more

Background
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 18, 1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant Health Inspection</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> (APHIS), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX>, published in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1697817105</NUMEX>) a proposed rule that was
intended to revise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> different parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 9 of the Code</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Regulations</ENAMEX>. These revisions established importation
criteria for certain animal and plant products based on the level
of disease risk in specified geographical locations.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> initially solicited comments for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> period
ending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17, 1996</TIMEX>. It later extended the period for an
additional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX>.
Based on its review of the comments received, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> has decided
that further analysis of most parts of the proposed rule is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> did determine, however, that the amendments to the
regulations allowing, under certain conditions, the importation of
fresh, chilled, or frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of Sonora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>,
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> could be issued as a final rule at this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. This report addresses only that final rule.
(i) Cost-benefit analysis
An economic impact analysis is included with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory</ENAMEX>
Impact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analysis</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25441</NUMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> production in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> is a relatively new development and because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> has restricted the importation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> and pork products
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 20 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> bases its potential impact analysis on
some assumptions regarding the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> production in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>
in the future, the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> production that might be
processed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> for shipment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and the
demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> estimates that the
importation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> could cause <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> to
lose from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 to 10 cents</NUMEX> per pound (liveweight) but could save
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7 to 16 cents</NUMEX> per pound (retail weight). APHIS
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that these estimates are dependent on both the amount of
fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> imported and on consumer reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> pork
products.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 18, 1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> published its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Initial Regulatory</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX> in the preamble to the proposed rule (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16978</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">17017</ENAMEX>). The analysis concluded that, because the rule
relaxed the hog <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX>-related restrictions imposed on the
importation of live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> and prepared pork <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, the proposed rule could have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The
initial analysis invited comments on the potential impacts
discussed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> stated that the precise impacts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork-product</ENAMEX> imports
were difficult to predict because of the uncertainty as to how they
would substitute for domestic and/or foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork products</ENAMEX>. APHIS
points out that commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> production in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> is relatively
new and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has imposed restrictions on the
importation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork products</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> for over
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>. The analysis does discuss, however, what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> considers
to be the anticipated impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> livestock sector: the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">farrow</ENAMEX>-to-finish <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>, the live-hog
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>/transporters, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">swine slaughterers</ENAMEX>/primary
processors.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 9, 1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> published its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Final Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
Analysis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25439</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">25441</ENAMEX>). In that analysis, APHIS
discusses the reason for the final rule and the legal basis for it.
It also describes and estimates the number of small entities
affected by the rule and discusses the recordkeeping, reporting,
and other compliance requirements.
Finally, it describes the alternatives considered in the
development of the rule and why it rejected them and adopted the
rule as proposed. The alternatives included
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) not lifting the current importation restrictions for the
State of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) allowing importation under either less or
more stringent mitigating conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> rejected the first
alternative because it believed scientific evidence permitted
importation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork products</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> and not permitting such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">importation</ENAMEX> would be contrary to trade agreements entered into by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> rejected the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> alternative because it
believed that less stringent mitigating measures than the ones
proposed would increase the risk of the introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hog cholera</ENAMEX>
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and that more stringent mitigating
conditions would be unnecessarily restrictive.

According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX>, this rule contains no federal mandates
(under the regulatory provisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title II of the Unfunded</ENAMEX>

The rule was issued as a notice of proposed rulemaking on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 1996</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16978</NUMEX>) under the notice and comment
procedures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">553</ENAMEX>. Initially, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX> allowed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> for
comments, but in response to several requests that the comment
period be extended, it allowed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 60-day</TIMEX> comment period.
All comments were due by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 17, 1996</TIMEX>. During the comment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">period APHIS</ENAMEX> also held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> public hearings at which both oral and
written comments were received. In total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX> comments were
received from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of state and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>,
international economic and political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, veterinary

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exporting</ENAMEX> and importing industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>, and other interested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. Based on the number and complexity of the comments, APHIS
decided to issue only a small portion of the proposed rule at this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and to review and reanalyze the other portions of the rule
before issuing them as final.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3501-3520</TIMEX>
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX>, the information collection and recordkeeping
requirements included in this final rule have been approved by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) in accordance with the

Executive Order No. 12866
The final rule is considered to be an "economically significant
regulatory action" under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Executive Order 12866</ENAMEX> and was reviewed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> for compliance with that order.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Environmental Policy</ENAMEX> Act, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. 4321 et</ENAMEX> seq.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">APHIS</ENAMEX> performed an environmental assessment and determined that
the actions required or authorized by this rule will not present a
significant risk of introducing
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-43</NUMEX>
or disseminating hog <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera disease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the
human environment. Based on those findings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> has
determined that an environmental impact statement need not be
prepared.
Executive Order 12988
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APHIS</ENAMEX>, this rule has been reviewed under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive</ENAMEX>
Order <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12988</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Justice Reform</ENAMEX>) and has been found to meet the
standards set forth in the order. The final rule preempts all state
and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with the final
rule, has no retroactive effect, and does not require
administrative proceedings before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> may file suit in court
challenging this rule.
