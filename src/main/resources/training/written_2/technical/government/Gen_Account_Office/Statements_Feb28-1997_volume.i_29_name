FOREWORD
This volume is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> volume set referred to as the
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Codification</ENAMEX>." It contains the original text that currently
constitutes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of accounting concepts and standards for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>. Specifically, the volume incorporates the
following documents published through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 28, 1997</TIMEX>:
-- Statements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Concepts</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> &
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and -- Statements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Standards</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.1</NUMEX>

Origins of the Statements
The concepts and standards presented in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> volume set
resulted from the joint efforts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of the Treasury</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>), and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>,
referred to collectively as the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>", established the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board</ENAMEX> (FASAB) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. FASAB
was created to consider and recommend accounting standards and
principles<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> ultimately decide upon the principles
and standards.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codification</ENAMEX> includes only those principles and standards
agreed to by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> is publishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codification</ENAMEX>
as a comprehensive basis of accounting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> reporting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>. It is expected that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> will continue to recommend
statements on specialized topics. As new statements and
interpretations are adopted, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codification</ENAMEX> will be updated.


Purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codification</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codification of Federal</ENAMEX> accounting concepts and standards is
a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> volume set with extensive cross-referencing and indexing. The
volumes are designed to meet the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> for references to
original statements (Volume I) and to standards alphabetized by
topic (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Volume II</ENAMEX>). Both volumes serve as authoritative references
to the standards and interpretations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
Statement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 8</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Stewardship Reporting</ENAMEX>, has been approved by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> but may not be implemented until it has
undergone a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45-day</TIMEX> review by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review</ENAMEX> was not completed
at the time this Volume was published. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAS No. 8</ENAMEX> is provided
herein for your convenience and future use. An announcement will be
made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> when the review has been completed and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAS No. 8</ENAMEX> can be implemented.

Volume I
This volume, Volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Concepts</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Standards-Original Statements</ENAMEX>, is a compilation of the documents
produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board</ENAMEX> and
adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
Once adopted, the documents are referred to as Statements of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Concepts</ENAMEX> (SFFAC or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concepts</ENAMEX>) and
Statements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Standards</ENAMEX> (SFFAS or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX>) respectively.
This volume presents the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Concepts</ENAMEX> in their entirety. Concepts do
not establish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> financial accounting standards; rather they
describe the concepts used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> as a framework as it considers
and recommends accounting principles for the Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Concepts are meant to guide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> financial
reporting such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preparers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>.
This volume extracts the authoritative portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX>
originally published in individual statements as well as the
explanatory text contained in any appendices. It does not reprint
the summaries or all introductory and background material since
these sections are not always essential to applying the standards
or understanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s conclusions. The Basis for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s
Conclusions for each standard is included since it serves to
explain the specific provisions of the standards.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">glossaries</ENAMEX> originally published with each statement have
been codified in a single glossary. This glossary is presented as
the last appendix to the volume.
Volume II
Volume II of this set, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A User's Guide</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial</ENAMEX>
Accounting Standards, is a codification of the standards. Volume II
presents the standards alphabetized by topic, pulls together all
references to a particular topic in one section, and integrates
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrative</ENAMEX> material from both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFASs</ENAMEX> and the original
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exposures Drafts</ENAMEX> wherever possible.


Applicability
The mission of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> is to recommend accounting concepts and
standards that result in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' financial reports
including understandable, relevant, and reliable information about
the financial position, activities, and results of operations of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> government and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component units</ENAMEX>. In addition,
the standards should foster the improvement of accounting systems
and internal controls that will help provide reasonable assurance
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> that government activities have been conducted
economically, efficiently, and effectively, and in compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> believes that
federal financial accounting concepts and standards should be
considered in establishing systems and in maintaining day-to-day
financial records as well as being applied to general purpose
financial reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U. S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. This
belief is consistent with the requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial</ENAMEX>
Management <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Improvement Act of 1996</ENAMEX> which states that "each agency
shall implement and maintain financial management systems that
comply substantially with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> financial management systems
requirements, applicable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> accounting standards, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Government Standard General Ledger</ENAMEX> at the transaction
level."<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
The specific applicability of the standards to components of the
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was considered during the development of
Statement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Concepts No. 2</ENAMEX> (SFFAC No.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Entity and Display</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAC No. 2</ENAMEX> lists criteria for including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> (see pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75-77</NUMEX>) and
provides the following guidance with regard to components required
by law or policy to issue financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting standards other than those constituting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal GAAP</ENAMEX>. For example, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are required to apply
accounting standards issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Accounting Standards</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> or a regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> should continue to
apply the standards required by law or policy for their financial
statements. The reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are a
part, however, need to be sensitive to differences that may arise
from the different accounting standards. If these differences are
material, the standards constituting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal GAAP</ENAMEX> should be applied
for purposes of including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>-wide statements.
In such cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> may need to provide additional
disclosures or different measurements required to comply with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal GAAP</ENAMEX>.
The standards need not be applied to immaterial items.


Hierarchy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Generally Accepted Accounting</ENAMEX>
Principles
The hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles4
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAAP</ENAMEX>) governs what constitutes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAAP</ENAMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government
reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> publishes the hierarchy in its bulletin
entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Form and Content of Agency Financial Statements</ENAMEX>. It lists
the priority sequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> should look to for
accounting and reporting guidance.
3Title <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX>--Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Financial Management Improvement Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sec.</ENAMEX> 803(a).
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>"Accounting principles" are those conventions, rules, and
procedures necessary to define acceptable accounting practice at a
particular time.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, through the joint efforts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, a body of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
covering most transactions was promulgated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
government. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> may engage in transactions that are
not addressed by these standards. In that event, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should
view the hierarchy as providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAAP</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government. While many of the standards comprising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> GAAP
have already been made effective, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of those standards will not
be effective until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1998</TIMEX>. The following hierarchy5

Source for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpretations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-134</ENAMEX> describes the policies for seeking and
providing interpretations and other advice related to the
standards. An interpretation is a document of narrow scope that
provides clarifications of original meaning, additional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">definitions</ENAMEX>, or other guidance pertaining to an existing SFFAS.
Requests for interpretations should be directed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB's Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Management</ENAMEX> or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executive Director</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> will respond to the request for guidance by
providing technical assistance unless they determine that the
response should be an Interpretation. In that event, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> staff
will provide written copies of the request to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> will examine, as appropriate, applicable literature and
consult with knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> and draft an Interpretation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Standards</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> will consider the
draft interpretation at an open meeting. After a majority agrees
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) approve and sign the interpretation; the interpretation will
be published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization of the Codification</ENAMEX>
Volume I presents the text of the original statements as
described above. Each statement is presented as a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>.
The issue date and effective date of each statement are presented
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. Next, references to relevant sections within Volume I and to
Volume II are provided. Any interpretations that relate to the
statements are also identified.
In some cases, the statements have been affected by later
statements or affect earlier statements. References direct the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reader</ENAMEX> to the affected paragraphs and indicate the source of the
change. Within the text of the statements, provisions deleted as a
result of other statements are marked with strikeouts and
provisions affected by other statements are doubleunderlined.
Double-underlined text remains as originally published. The
double-underlining is intended to alert the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to the fact that
it has been modified or affected by a later statement.
A brief summary of the statement is presented. A table of
contents referenced to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> and paragraph numbers follows the
summary. Note that the paragraph numbers are those originally
expressed in the individual statements despite the omission of some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paragraphs</ENAMEX>. Any omitted paragraphs are indicated in the table of
contents.
Volume I also presents the following appendices:

Volume II is under development at this time and will be
organized alphabetically by topic. Topics will be specific
financial statement items. Each topical section will be identified
by an alpha-numeric code (for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX> for "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pensions"</ENAMEX>), with
numbers selected to allow addition of future topics.
Paragraphs within each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> will be numbered consecutively.
The following numeric format has been proposed:
Paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.100</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.599</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> and Potential Note Disclosures
Paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.600</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.699</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Interpretations Published</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB Paragraphs</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.700</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.799</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nonauthoritative Discussion & Illustrations</ENAMEX>
Source references will be provided in paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.100</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.599</NUMEX> to
indicate the original statement from which material was drawn. The
references will appear in brackets at the end of each paragraph or
illustration. For example, the reference [<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SFFAS 7</ENAMEX>, para. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>] refers
to Statement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 7</ENAMEX>,
Accounting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revenue</ENAMEX> and Other Financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concepts</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reconciling Budgetary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Accounting</ENAMEX>, paragraph <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>.
Source references will be provided in the nonauthoritative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paragraphs</ENAMEX> as footnotes to permit more descriptive identification
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
Volume II will present the following appendices and may present

TRANSACTIONS WITH THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PUBLIC</ENAMEX>
Nonexchange transactions with the public
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">242</NUMEX>. Individual income taxes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> income taxes, social
insurance taxes and contributions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,37</NUMEX> excise taxes, estate and gift
taxes, and customs duties.--Taxes (including customs duties) are
levied through the exercise of the power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> to
compel payment. In broad terms, taxes are "the price we pay for
civilization." More specifically they finance spending of many
types to promote the general welfare, provide for the common
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX>, and ensure domestic tranquillity: national defense, a
judicial system, aid to the elderly, construction of
infrastructure, education and training, and so forth. The
relationship between the tax paid and the value received is too
indirect and disproportionate to relate the revenue that is
received from any identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> to the cost that is
incurred for providing that identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> with benefits.
This is especially the case where the benefits are of a collective
or public nature, such as national defense, in which case
consumption by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> does not reduce the consumption
available for another; or where the benefits are designed to
redistribute income from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to another. Therefore,
tax revenue is nonexchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">243</NUMEX>. All excise taxes, like other taxes, are classified as
resulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nonexchange</TIMEX> revenue. Some excise taxes (considered to
be benefit taxes) are levied on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> that are related to the use
of publicly provided goods and services or the public provision of
other benefits, such as the gasoline tax; certain other excise
taxes are levied on bases related to a cause of some damage and are
dedicated to pay down costs, such as the tax on domestically mined
coal, which is dedicated to the black lung disability trust fund.
Even in these cases, however, the relationship between the tax and
the benefit received by an identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> is relatively
indirect and disproportionate. Moreover, these excise taxes, like
other taxes, are determined through the exercise of the power of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> to compel payment. Therefore, like other taxes, they
are classified as producing nonexchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">244</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have differing views on whether social
insurance programs result in exchange or nonexchange
transactions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38</NUMEX> However, they agree that social insurance tax
revenue should be reported in the same way as other tax revenue for
the purposes of financial reporting. This is because social
insurance taxes, like other taxes, are determined through the
exercise of the power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> to compel payment.
Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> subject to social insurance
taxes are subject to them as a byproduct of their decision to enter
covered employment or engage in a covered business, so especially
for the major, broad-based social insurance programs--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> (hospital insurance), and unemployment
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>"<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Social</ENAMEX> insurance" does not include programs established
solely or primarily for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, such as pension and
other retirement plans. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> insurance" taxes and contributions
do, however, include payments made by or on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to social insurance plans, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>.

compensation--they have virtually no legal option except to
pay.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245</NUMEX>. Tax receipts are generally collected from the public by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX>) and, to a lesser extent, by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> acting as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">entity</ENAMEX> receives the cash and then transfers it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>,
trust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX>, or special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> on whose behalf it was collected. The
amount so collected should be accounted for as a custodial activity
by the collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. The tax is recognized as a nonexchange
revenue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that is legally entitled to the amount. This
would be a trust fund or special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> in the case of an earmarked
(i.e., dedicated) tax. If collected on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> as
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX>, it would be recognized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>-wide consolidated

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">246</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> insurance taxes and contributions paid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.39</NUMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> may be covered by social insurance
programs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Security40</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> under the same
terms and conditions as the remainder of the covered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
The payments made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are in the nature of taxes,
compulsory payments demanded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> through the exercise
of its power to compel payment. Insofar as the social insurance
program applies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the
terms and conditions are generally the same as the program for
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> and employee contributions are
generally calculated in the same way; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> contribution is
not earned by the social insurance program; and the benefits are
generally calculated in the same way. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> does not obtain
particular benefits under the plan from rendering service in
Federal employment, because he or she would have been similarly
covered by the program if privately employed and would have
obtained similar benefits. For these reasons, the employee
contribution should have the same classification as contributions
by non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, which is nonexchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">247</NUMEX>. Deposits by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> for unemployment trust fund.--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>
deposit the receipts from the state unemployment tax to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> for the unemployment trust fund in order to finance most
of the benefits under the unemployment compensation system. The
state unemployment tax differs from state to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in terms of the
tax rate, tax base, and certain other characteristics, and
unemployment benefits also differ from state to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
Nevertheless, the deposit has long been construed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
budget receipt (a governmental receipt), and the unemployment trust
fund has long been included as an account in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">248</NUMEX>. This is for a combination of reasons taken together: (a)
the unemployment compensation system--including the system of
taxes, the system of benefits, and the trust fund--was established
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> Act of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX> and has been amended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
law many times; (b) deposits are held in a trust fund operated by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>; (c) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> law specifies extensive
requirements for the state unemployment tax and unemployment

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> insurance" does not include programs established solely

Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> hired before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> are not

system; and (e) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> law effectively coerces <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to
participate in the system, with participation requiring them to
levy the state unemployment tax and deposit the collections in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX>. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> does not participate (or is not certified
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX> as meeting Federal requirements): (i)
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> unemployment tax is levied within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> at its
maximum rate, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the system does not pay any unemployment
compensation benefits within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government provides no grants to state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to pay for the
costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. The deposits of the state tax are
therefore nonexchange revenue of the unemployment trust fund. (The
Federal unemployment tax is levied and collected separately from
the state unemployment tax.)
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">249</NUMEX>. User fees, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Harbor Maintenance</ENAMEX> trust fund. --This is an
example of a tax that is termed a "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fee" by law while
classified in the budget as a governmental receipt together with
other taxes and duties. It is an ad valorem tax of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.125 percent</NUMEX>
imposed on commercial cargo loaded and unloaded at specified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> open to public navigation. The receipt is earmarked to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Harbor Maintenance</ENAMEX> trust fund. It is similar in nature to other
excise taxes that result from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s power to compel
payment and that are dedicated to a trust fund or special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> to
be spent for a designated purpose (for example, the gasoline excise
tax, which is dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highway Trust Fund</ENAMEX>). It therefore
should be recognized as nonexchange revenue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbor</ENAMEX>
Maintenance trust fund.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> fees.--The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> collects revenue
primarily from duties on imported merchandise but also from two
types of fees: the merchandise processing fee and a group of fees
called "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fees."
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251</NUMEX>. The merchandise processing fee is primarily an ad valorem
charge on formal merchandise entries into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> (at
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.19 percent</NUMEX>) subject to a maximum and minimum charge. It also
includes flat fees on informally entered goods. The collections are
earmarked by law to a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> from which receipts are made
available to finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> to the extent
provided by current appropriations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">252</NUMEX>. The merchandise processing fee is associated with the cost
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>'s operations. The fee as originally enacted
was modified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Customs and Trade Act of 1990</ENAMEX> to make it
consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> obligations under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GATT</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Agreement</ENAMEX>
on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX>) after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> had ruled that the
original fee (a straight ad valorem fee) exceeded the cost of
services rendered and was a tax on imports that discriminated
against imports in favor of domestic production. The maximum and
minimum fees and the flat fees were enacted to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
obligation.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253</NUMEX>. However, the associated cost is primarily some of the costs
of assessing and collecting duties on imported merchandise, such as
the salaries of import <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> (who classify merchandise) and
the costs of processing paperwork. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">importer</ENAMEX> pays duties that
are required by law; it does not receive anything of value from the
Government in the nature of an exchange. Furthermore, these costs
are not likely to depend significantly on the value of the
merchandise, and the fee is levied through the power of the
Government to compel payment. Therefore, for the purpose of a
classification system for financial reporting, the fee is akin to
dedicated taxes that are also related in the aggregate to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> costs and that are classified as nonexchange revenue
(e.g., the excise tax on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX>). The merchandise processing fee
is therefore classified as a nonexchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">254</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fees consist of a group of flat fees charged on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and conveyances entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.41 The collections
are dedicated by law to a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> whose receipts are made
available by permanent indefinite appropriation to finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>
Service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">255</NUMEX>. These fees are intended to offset certain inspection costs
that relate to the processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and conveyances
entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. They are levied through the power of the
Government to compel payment, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that pays
these fees does not receive anything of value from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
in exchange. The inspection activities are for a variety of
purposes: to ensure that dutiable merchandise is declared, to seize
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contraband</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX> and illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>), to detect
infringements of patent and copyright laws, and so forth. Some of
these purposes are related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s powers to raise
taxes, which are nonexchange revenue, and to enforce laws. Only to
a limited extent are they like regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fees, based on the
Government's power to regulate particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> or activities.
Therefore, like the merchandise processing fee, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fees are
classified as nonexchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">256</NUMEX>. Deposits of earnings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX>.--The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve System</ENAMEX> consists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Governors of the Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve System</ENAMEX> and twelve regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Banks</ENAMEX>. Under
Federal accounting concepts, it is not considered to be part of the
Government-wide reporting entity. Therefore, payments made to or
collections received from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX> would be
reported in the financial statements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and
its component reporting entities<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.42</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> earns large
amounts of interest on its portfolio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities and
deposits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> all net income after deducting dividends
and the amount necessary to bring the surplus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Banks</ENAMEX> to the level of capital paid-in.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> was established by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
pursuant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s sovereign power over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s
money, and its investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities is necessary for
carrying out its monetary function. It does not receive anything of
value from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> in exchange for its deposit of earnings,
and on occasion it has been required by law to make extra payments.
The revenue from the deposits is therefore nonexchange.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">258</NUMEX>. Donations: except types of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment
that are expensed.--Donations are contributions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>,

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-Federal</ENAMEX> entity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.43</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> does not give anything of
value to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> receives only personal
satisfaction. The donation
41These fees are sometimes called the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COBRA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fees." This

of cash, other financial resources, or nonfinancial resources
(except stewardship property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment) is therefore a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX> revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">259</NUMEX>. The exception, stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>, consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission PP&E</ENAMEX>, heritage assets, and stewardship land. Such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> is expensed if purchased, but no amount is recognized if
it is received as a donation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correspondingly</ENAMEX>, no revenue is
recognized for such donations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fines</ENAMEX> and penalties.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fines</ENAMEX> and penalties are monetary
requirements imposed on those who violate laws or administrative
rules. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that pays a fine or penalty does
not receive anything of value in exchange, nor does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
sacrifice anything of value. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> collects these amounts
through the exercise of its power to compel payment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fines</ENAMEX> and
penalties are therefore a nonexchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">261</NUMEX>. Fines from judicial proceedings are collected by the entity
acting as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> as a whole rather than on its
own behalf. They are therefore accounted for as a custodial
activity of the collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and recognized as a nonexchange
revenue in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>-wide consolidated financial
statements.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">262</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fines</ENAMEX> and penalties produced by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
operations--such as inspections to ensure compliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
law and with regulations that are the responsibility of the entity
(e.g., inspections by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Surface Mining</ENAMEX>) or compliance
with regulations for the conduct of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> program--are
recognized as nonexchange revenue by whichever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> is legally
entitled by law to the revenue. In some cases, but not all, this
would be the collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. If the collecting entity transfers
the nonexchange revenue to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> or another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, the
amount is accounted for as a custodial activity by the collecting
entity. If transferred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>, the penalties are
recognized as nonexchange revenue in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>-wide
consolidated financial statements; if transferred to another
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>, they are recognized as nonexchange revenue by the entity
that receives the transfer.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">263</NUMEX>. Penalties due to delinquent taxes in connection with
custodial activity.--The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or other private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that pays a
penalty on delinquent taxes does not receive anything in exchange,
nor does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> sacrifice anything of value. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
collects these amounts through its power to compel payment.
Penalties on delinquent taxes are therefore a nonexchange revenue.
The penalties are accounted for as a custodial activity. If
transferred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>, the penalties are recognized as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX> revenue in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>-wide consolidated financial
statements; if transferred to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, they are recognized
as nonexchange revenue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that receives the
transfer.

recognized revenue (e.g., accrued tax receivables)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.45</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">265</NUMEX>. The timing of revenue recognition depends on how the
property is forfeited and the nature of the property. In the case
of unclaimed and abandoned merchandise, revenue is recognized in
the amount of the sales proceeds at the time the property is sold.
In the case of property acquired through forfeiture proceedings,
the timing of recognition depends on the nature and disposition of
the property. For monetary instruments, the revenue is recognized
at the time of obtaining forfeiture judgment; for property that is
sold, at the time of sale; and for property that is held for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> use or transferred to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, at the time
of obtaining approval to use the property internally or transfer
it.46
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">266</NUMEX>. The method of measuring revenue depends on the nature of
the property. The amount of revenue recognized for monetary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruments</ENAMEX> is the market value when the forfeiture judgment is
obtained. For property that is sold, it is the sales proceeds. For
property that is held for internal use or transferred to another
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, it is the fair value of the property less a
valuation allowance for any liens or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> claims.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">267</NUMEX>. The revenue from forfeiture is nonexchange revenue, because
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> seizes the property through the exercise of its
power. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> does not sacrifice anything of value in
exchange and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that forfeits the property does not receive
anything of value. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> of the forfeiture revenue of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> funds mentioned above is from currency and other monetary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instruments</ENAMEX>. Although other types of forfeited property must be
sold in order to recognize revenue, or constructively sold (if
transferred to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> or placed into internal use),
this is the last step in a process that is inherently
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">268</NUMEX>. The disposition of the revenue from forfeiture is
determined by law. Revenue or the property itself may ultimately be
distributed to the seizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, state or local law enforcement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, or the general fund. Revenue is
recognized as nonexchange revenue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that is legally
entitled to use the revenue or to use the property itself. If the
property is distributed to a state or local law enforcement agency
or a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, revenue is not recognized by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government reporting entity. If the revenue is transferred to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>, it is recognized as nonexchange revenue in the
Government-wide consolidated financial statements.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">269</NUMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> may be involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
liquidation of forfeited property but not themselves be entitled to
the revenue or to the use of the property. For example, a central
fund created to support the seizure activities of multiple
entities

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAS No. 3</ENAMEX>, para. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57-78</NUMEX>. The standard also requires deferred
revenue to be recognized when a forfeiture judgment is obtained,
but the deferred revenue is reversed when revenue is recognized.
The amount of revenue ordinarily differs from the amount of
deferred revenue. In some cases, an adjustment subsequent to the
original forfeiture judgment may be necessary when it is later
determined that a portion of the forfeiture is to be distributed to
state or local law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> or foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.
may manage forfeited property and the collection and disposition
of the revenue from that property. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> should account
for the property as a custodial activity. Revenue is shown when it
is recognized, and it is shown as transferred to others when the
cash is disbursed or the property is delivered. The disposition of
property to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> is also
accounted for.
Exchange transactions with the public: revenue
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">270</NUMEX>. Sales of goods and services.--The cost of production for
goods and services such as electricity, mail delivery, and maps is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defrayed</ENAMEX> in whole or in part by revenue from selling the goods or
services provided. The sales may be made by a public enterprise
revolving fund (such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonneville Power Administration</ENAMEX>), an
intragovernmental revolving fund (such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Printing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>), or a fund that is not a revolving fund (such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geological Survey</ENAMEX>). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and sacrifices something of
value. The sale is therefore an exchange transaction, and the
revenue is exchange revenue for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> making the sale.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271</NUMEX>. Sales of goods and services in undercover operations.--The
cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s undercover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> is defrayed in whole
or in part from the proceeds of sales of goods that have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">purchased</ENAMEX> (as opposed to goods that have been forfeited). Each
party receives and sacrifices something of value. These
characteristics of the transaction are not affected by whether the
sale is illegal. The sale is therefore an exchange transactions,
and the revenue is exchange revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> making the
sale.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">272</NUMEX>. Interest (unless classified elsewhere), dividends, and
rents (except for mineral rights) on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> property.--Each
party receives and sacrifices something of value, so the inflow of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> is an exchange transaction.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">273</NUMEX>. Interest is classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue notwithstanding
the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> may not be charged a cost of capital for
the assets that yield these inflows; or, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> borrowed
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> to acquire the assets, it may have been charged a
below-market interest rate. The gross cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> is
understated in such cases; and to recognize an exchange revenue is
to recognize a revenue without some or all of the related costs,
and hence to understate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s net cost of operations.
Nevertheless, in some cases the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> does pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> at
least some interest; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s cost of borrowing to
acquire the assets is recognized as a cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> as a
whole. Since some cost is recognized, even if not always the full
cost of the entity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,47</NUMEX> an exchange revenue is recognized for the
entity that receives the inflow of interest.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">274</NUMEX>. Rents, royalties, and bonuses on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer Continental Shelf</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCS</ENAMEX>) and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">petroleum</ENAMEX> and mineral rights.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rents</ENAMEX>, royalties,
and bonuses are exchange revenues, because each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and
sacrifices something of value. The amounts are earned by sales in
the market and therefore are exchange revenue. They are collected
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minerals Management Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMS</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX>, which

The partial recognition of associated cost distinguishes
interest from rents, royalties, and bonuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer</ENAMEX>

latter transactions, see the subsequent paragraphs.
manages the energy and minerals resources on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCS</ENAMEX> and
collects the amounts due the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minerals</ENAMEX> produced on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCS</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
lands.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">275</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMS</ENAMEX> does not recognize a depletion cost for various
reasons, including the fact that under present accounting standards
natural resources are not recognized as an asset and depletion is
not recognized as a cost. As a result, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue bears
little relationship to the recognized cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMS</ENAMEX> and cannot be
matched against its gross cost of operations. Therefore, although
the inflows are exchange revenue, they should not be subtracted
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMS</ENAMEX>'s gross cost in determining its net cost of
operations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">276</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMS</ENAMEX> should instead account for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue as a
custodial activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMS</ENAMEX> collects rents, royalties, and bonuses
acting as an agent on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> designated by law:
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>, certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> to which
amounts are earmarked, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> and allottees.
The amounts of revenue should be recognized and measured under the
exchange revenue standards when they are due pursuant to the
contractual agreement.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">277</NUMEX>. The rents, royalties, and bonuses transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>, or to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>,
should be recognized by them as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue. However, neither
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> as a whole nor the other recipient entities
recognize the natural resources as an asset and depletion as a
cost. Therefore, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue should not offset their
gross cost in determining their net cost of operations. It should
instead be a financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> in determining their operating
results and change in net position.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">278</NUMEX>. Proceeds from the auction of the radio spectrum.--The
proceeds from auctioning the right to use the radio spectrum are
exchange revenues, because each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and sacrifices
something of value. The amount of revenue is earned by sales in the
market at auctions. It bears little relationship to the costs
recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>), which
collects the revenue, or to the costs recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Government as a whole. Therefore, it should not be offset against
the costs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> in determining its net cost of operations or
against the costs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> as a whole in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>-wide
consolidated financial statements.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">279</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> should therefore account for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue
as a custodial activity, acting as an agent on behalf of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>; and it should be included as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue in the
Government-wide consolidated financial statements.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX>. Interest on post-199148 direct loans<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.49</NUMEX>--Interest on direct
loans is an exchange transaction, because it is part of a broader
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX> transaction in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> makes a loan to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrower</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrower</ENAMEX> each receives and sacrifices
something of value. Interest on direct loans that are budgeted
according to the provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Federal Credit Reform Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components: the nominal interest (the stated
interest rate times the nominal principal) and the amortized
interest (change in present value of the loans receivable due to
the passage of time). The combined effect of these components
equals the effective interest, which is directly defined as the
present value of the loans receivable times the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> interest
rate applicable to the particular loans (i.e., the interest rate
used to calculate the present value of the direct loans when the
direct loans were disbursed). The effective interest causes an
equal increase in the aggregate value of the assets on the balance
sheet, and therefore the effective interest is the amount
recognized as exchange

revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">281</NUMEX>. Interest on delinquent taxes and other receivables that
arise as the result of custodial operations.--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Receivables</ENAMEX> that
arise as the result of custodial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are custodial (or
non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>) assets, held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> or another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> as an agent
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> as a whole rather than on its own behalf (e.g.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> tax receivables on which the delinquent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayer</ENAMEX> must pay
interest). The interest is an exchange revenue, because each party
receives and sacrifices something of value, but it is not related
to the costs incurred by the collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. The interest is
accounted for as a custodial activity by the collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. If
transferred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>, the interest is recognized as
exchange revenue in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>-wide consolidated financial
statements because it is related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s cost of
borrowing; if transferred to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, it is recognized as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX> revenue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that receives the transfer.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">282</NUMEX>. Regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fees such as patent and copyright fees;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immigration</ENAMEX> and consular fees; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> registration and filing fees;
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX> fees.--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> fees are
charges based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s power to regulate particular
businesses or activities. The revenue is related to the cost in one
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways. Special benefits may be provided to identifiable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> who pay the fees, beyond the benefits, if any, that
accrue to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> (e.g., passport fees); or the
Government may incur costs in order to regulate an identifiable
entity for the benefit of the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> or some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
in which case the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> charge compensates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> for its
regulatory costs that were caused by the activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> that
pays the charge (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX>
fees).

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Post-1991</ENAMEX> direct loans consist of direct loans that were

consist of direct loans that were obligated before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 1991</TIMEX>.
The same accounting that is used for post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> direct loans is also

study, also see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix B.</ENAMEX>
Because in general the revenue is closely related to the cost of
operations, these fees are classified as exchange transactions and
the revenue is an exchange revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that charges the
fee.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">283</NUMEX>. Diversion fees, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX>.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Registrants</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diversion Control Program</ENAMEX> (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>) pay fees to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX>, in exchange for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> provides
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">registrants</ENAMEX> with the authority to prescribe controlled
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX>. The diversion fees are intended to cover the costs of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diversion Control Program</ENAMEX>. Because the revenue is related to
the cost and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">registrants</ENAMEX> both receive and sacrifice value, the
payment of these fees is an exchange revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diversion</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Program</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">284</NUMEX>. Premiums for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Medical Insurance</ENAMEX>), bank
deposit insurance, pension benefit guarantees, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> insurance, life
insurance, and other insurance.--In exchange for a premium and
other considerations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> promises to make payments to
program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> if specified events occur. The premium offsets
the cost of the program in whole or in part. The degree to which
participation is voluntary differs from program to program. Because
the revenue is related to the cost of the providing service, it is
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue of the insurance program.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">285</NUMEX>. Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> contributions to pension and other
retirement benefit plans<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.51</NUMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>
provide service to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> in exchange for compensation, of
which some is received currently (the salary) and some is deferred
(pensions, retirement health benefits, and other retirement
benefits). This is an exchange transaction, because each party
sacrifices value and receives value in return. As part of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX> transaction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> promises a pension to its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> after they retire. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> also promises other
retirement benefits, notably health benefits. In return, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> provides services and, under some plans, makes a
contribution to the retirement fund out of his or her salary. The
financing of these benefits may include contributions paid by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> to the retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">286</NUMEX>. In broad terms, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> contribution is an inflow of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to the retirement fund as part of this exchange
transaction. More narrowly, it is a payment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> as part
of an exchange of money and services for a future pension or other
retirement benefit. Therefore, it is an exchange revenue of the
entity that administers the retirement plan and thus is an offset
to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s gross cost in calculating its net cost of
operations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.52</NUMEX>
51Federal employee retirement plans do not include social
insurance, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX>.
52For further discussion of the accounting standards for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pensions</ENAMEX> and other retirement benefits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, see

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">para</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">56-93 and 148-181.</TIMEX> The standards do not cover accounting for
the plan per se as distinct from the administering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. Nor do
they cover defined contribution plans, or administrative entities
that are not Federal reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">287</NUMEX>. Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> contributions to health benefits plan for
current coverage.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> of the Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> provide
services to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> in exchange for compensation, of which
some is received currently in the form of money (the salary); some
is received currently in the form of payments to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> contribution to the medical insurance plan for
current coverage of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>); and some is deferred (pensions
and other retirement benefits). This is an exchange transaction,
because each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> sacrifices value and receives value in return.
As part of this exchange transaction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> and its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> both contribute to a medical insurance plan that provides
current coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</NUMEX>. In broad terms, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> contribution out of his or her
salary is an inflow of resources to the health benefits plan as
part of this exchange transaction. More narrowly, it is a payment
in exchange for current coverage by a health benefits plan.
Therefore, it is an exchange revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that administers
the health benefits plan and thus is an offset to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
gross cost in calculating its net cost of operations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">289</NUMEX>. Reimbursement for collecting revenue.--The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>
collects duties on goods imported by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and the Virgin
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> retains an amount equal to the
estimated cost of collecting these duties, including all costs of
operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> and an allocation
of overhead; it transfers the remainder to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, which, in
turn, transfers the collections to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> or the Virgin
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX>. The total amount of duties collected on these goods should
be accounted for as a custodial activity by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>.
Notwithstanding that duties are a nonexchange revenue, these
particular duties are a nonexchange revenue of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> other than
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and therefore are not recognized as a nonexchange
revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">291</NUMEX>. The method of disposing of these collections combines two
distinct transactions into one. The entire amount of the duties
could be transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>, and
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> could then pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> to reimburse
it for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of collecting duties. The payment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>
would be exchange revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>. The actual
procedure for reimbursement, whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> retains an amount
equal to the estimated cost, is simpler but equivalent in
substance. Hence, the custodial transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>) and the amount retained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>
should be shown as separate components of the disposition of the
revenue from customs duties. The amount retained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> to
reimburse itself for its costs is exchange revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>
Service and is offset against its gross cost in calculating its net
cost of operations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">292</NUMEX>. Reimbursement for cleanup costs.--The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> or other
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> may incur costs to clean up environmental hazards
caused by private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and, in some cases, require these private
parties to reimburse it for the costs incurred. Notwithstanding
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> demands the revenue under its power to compel
payment, the revenue arises from the action of the private parties
and is closely related to the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> incurred as a
result of that action. Therefore, the revenue is an exchange
revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that incurs the cost.
Exchange transactions with the public: gains and losses
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293</NUMEX>. Note: As explained in the introduction to this appendix,
transactions that are classified as producing gains or losses
should instead be classified as producing revenue or expense if
they are usual and recurring for a particular reporting entity.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">294</NUMEX>. Sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> assets: other than property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> and forfeited and foreclosed property.--The sale of
Government assets (other than property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forfeited</ENAMEX> and foreclosed property) is an exchange transaction,
because each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and sacrifices something of value. If
the sales price equals book value, there is no gain or loss,
because a cash inflow equal to book value is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of one
asset for another of equal recorded value and therefore not a net
inflow of resources. If the sales price is more or less than the
book value of the property, a gain or loss, respectively, is
recognized to the extent of the difference. The amount of the
difference between sales price and book value is ordinarily a gain
or loss rather than a revenue or expense, because sales of property
are ordinarily an unusual or nonrecurring inflow of resources.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">295</NUMEX>. Sales of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment.-- The transaction
is an exchange transaction, because each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and
sacrifices something of value. If the sales <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">price53</TIMEX> equals book
value, there is no gain or loss, because a cash inflow equal to
book value is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> asset for another of equal
recorded value and therefore not a net inflow of resources. If the
sales price is more or less than book value, a gain or loss,
respectively, is recognized to the extent of the difference. The
amount of the difference is ordinarily a gain or loss rather than a
revenue or an expense, because sales of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
equipment are ordinarily an unusual or nonrecurring inflow of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">296</NUMEX>. The entire sales price is a gain if the book value of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. The book value is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> (a) if the asset is general
property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment (PP&E) that is fully depreciated
or written-off or (b) if the asset is stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>, for
which the entire cost is expensed when the asset is
purchased<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.54</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">297</NUMEX>. Acquisition of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>.--The cost of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment (PP&E)
acquired through an exchange of assets with the public is the fair
value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>. If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired is more readily determinable
than that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered, the cost is the fair value
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired. If neither fair value is determinable,
the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired is the cost recorded for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered net of any accumulated depreciation or
amortization. In the event that cash consideration is included in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired is increased (or

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">298</NUMEX>. Any difference between the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired
and the book value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered is recognized as a
gain or loss.55 It is a gain or loss rather than a revenue or

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired is
recognized at its cost and subsequently reduced to its fair value.
The difference between the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired and its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> value is recognized as a loss<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.56</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>. Sales of foreclosed property: associated with pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1992</NUMEX>
direct loans and loan guarantees.--Foreclosed property associated
with pre-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> direct loans and loan guarantees is recognized as an
asset at net realizable value. The sale is an exchange transaction,
and any difference between the sales proceeds and book value is
recognized as a gain or loss<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.57</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">301</NUMEX>. Sales of receivables: except direct loans.--The transaction
is an exchange transaction, because each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and
sacrifices something of value. Upon sale, any difference between
the sales proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss.
If the sales price equals book value, there is no gain or loss,
because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> asset for another of equal value is not
a net inflow of resources.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">302</NUMEX>. Sales of direct loans.--The sale of a direct loan is a
modification according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990</ENAMEX>,
regardless of whether the loan being sold was obligated after FY
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> or before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FY</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. The book value loss (or gain) on a sale of
direct loans equals the book value of the loans sold (prior to
sale) minus the net proceeds of the sale. It normally differs from
the cost of modification, which is recognized as an expense<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.58</NUMEX> Any
difference between the book value loss (or gain) and the cost of
modification is recognized as a gain or loss<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.59</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">303</NUMEX>. Retirement of debt securities prior to maturity.--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Debt</ENAMEX>
securities may be retired prior to maturity if they have a call
feature or if they are eligible for redemption by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> on
demand. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds issued before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> are callable;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> bonds, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> account series, the foreign series,
and the state and local series

This difference is due to the different interest rates used to
discount future cash flows for calculating the subsidy cost (and
subsidy allowance) when the loan is made and for calculating the
cost of modification at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later time</TIMEX>. If the sale is with recourse,
the present value of the estimated loss from the recourse is also
recognized as an expense.

of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities are redeemable on demand, although
sometimes with a penalty or other adjustment or only after a
specified period of time.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">304</NUMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and sacrifices something of value in
buying and selling debt securities that may be retired prior to
maturity. The sales price reflects such features. Therefore, the
transaction is an exchange transaction. The difference, if any,
between the reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the
extinguished debt is recognized as a loss or gain<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.60</NUMEX>
Other financing sources from the public
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">305</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seigniorage</ENAMEX>.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seigniorage</ENAMEX> is the face value of newly minted
coins less the cost of production (which includes the cost of the
metal, manufacturing, and transportation). It results from the
sovereign power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> to directly create money and,
although not an inflow of resources from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, does increase
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s net position in the same manner as an inflow of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Because it is not demanded, earned, or donated, it is an
other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> rather than revenue. It should be recognized
as an other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> when coins are delivered to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Banks</ENAMEX> in return for deposits.
INTRAGOVERNMENTAL TRANSACTIONS
Nonexchange transactions--intragovernmental: revenue
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">306</NUMEX>. Interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities held by trust funds and
special <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX> (except trust revolving funds).--Many trust funds and
special funds hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities on which they receive
interest. In most cases the invested balances of these funds derive
predominantly from the funds' earmarked taxes, which are
nonexchange transactions with the public (e.g., employment taxes
and gasoline taxes), and to a lesser extent from other financing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> received from other government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> (e.g., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>
Fund payment appropriated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Medical Insurance</ENAMEX>
fund). The balances are not earned in exchange transactions by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s operations. Most fundamentally, they are not produced by
operations in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> incurs a cost.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">307</NUMEX>. Therefore, in such cases, the interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
securities should not be deducted from the gross costs of the trust
fund (or special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX>), or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in which it is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">administered</ENAMEX>, in determining its net cost of operations. As a
result, that interest should not be classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue.
It should instead have the same classification as the predominant
source of the invested balances, which for most trust funds (and
special <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX>) is nonexchange revenue. The interest received from
invested balances of trust funds and special <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX> (except trust
revolving funds) is therefore normally a nonexchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">308</NUMEX>. The source of balances for some trust funds and special
funds may not be predominantly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nonexchange</TIMEX> revenue. For example,
the main source of balances for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major trust funds, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Retirement and Disability</ENAMEX> fund and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military</ENAMEX>

Retirement fund, consists of exchange revenue and other
financing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. In such exceptional cases, as explained in the
Basis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conclusions</ENAMEX>, the interest should be classified in the
same way as the predominant source of balances--in these cases, as
exchange revenue--rather than according to the normal rule.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">309</NUMEX>. Interest received by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> from another.--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> fund
within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> may borrow from another. For example, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old-Age and Survivors Insurance</ENAMEX> trust fund borrowed from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disability Insurance and Hospital Insurance</ENAMEX> trust funds. When that
occurs, the lending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> sacrifices interest from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
securities on its invested balances and instead receives interest
from the borrowing fund on the amount of the loan. Since the
predominant source of balances to the lending fund is the same
regardless of whether it invests in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities or lends to
another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX>, the interest received from the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> should be
classified in the same way--as nonexchange or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue--as
the interest received on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">310</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Employer entity</ENAMEX> contributions to social insurance
programs<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.61</TIMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> may be covered by social insurance
programs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Security62</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> under the same
terms and conditions as the rest of the covered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
Intragovernmental contributions to social insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> are nonexchange transactions, just
as payments made by private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> to these programs are
nonexchange transactions. Contributions by private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> are in
the nature of taxes; i.e., compulsory payments demanded by the
Government through the exercise of its power to compel payment.
Insofar as the social insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> applies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, the terms and conditions are generally the same as the
program for private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> and employee
contributions are generally calculated in the same way; the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> contribution is not earned by the social insurance
program; and the benefits are generally calculated in the same way.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> does not obtain particular benefits under the plan
from rendering service in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> employment, because he or she
would have been similarly covered by the program if privately
employed and would have received similar benefits. For these
reasons, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> contribution should have the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> as private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> contributions, which is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX> revenue.
Nonexchange transactions--intragovernmental: gains and
losses
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">311</NUMEX>. Retirement of debt securities prior to maturity: trust
funds and special <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">funds</NUMEX> (except trust revolving funds).--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
securities held by trust funds and special funds are primarily
issued in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> account series, which can generally be
redeemed on demand. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities held by these funds
may also be callable or redeemable on demand. If these debt
securities are retired before maturity, the difference, if any,
between the reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the
extinguished debt should be recognized as a gain or loss by the
fund that owned the securities. The gain or loss should be
accounted for as a nonexchange gain or loss if
61
"<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Social</ENAMEX> insurance" does not include programs established solely
or primarily for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, such as pension and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retirement</ENAMEX> plans.
62
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> hired before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> are not
covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>.
the interest on the associated debt securities is classified as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX> revenue, and it should be accounted for as an exchange
gain or loss if the interest on the associated debt securities is
classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue. For trust funds (except trust
revolving funds) and special funds, as explained elsewhere, the
interest is normally but not always a nonexchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">312</NUMEX>. The difference, if any, between the reacquisition price and
the net carrying value of the extinguished debt should be
recognized as a loss or gain in accounting for interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
debt. The amount should be equal in absolute value but with the
opposite sign to the gain or loss recognized by the trust fund or
special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX>. The amount should be recognized as a gain or loss
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> in order to offset it against the gross interest on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> debt in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>-wide consolidated financial
statements.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">313</NUMEX>. Cancellation of debt.--The debt that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> owes
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> (or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>) may be canceled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The
amount of debt that is canceled (including the amount of
capitalized interest that is canceled, if any) is a gain to the
entity whose debt is canceled and a loss to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> (or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>). The purpose of borrowing authority is generally to provide
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> with capital rather than to finance its operations.
Therefore, the cancellation of debt is not earned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
operations and is not directly related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s costs of
providing goods and services. As a result, the cancellation is a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX> gain to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that owed the debt and a nonexchange
loss to the lender.
Exchange transactions--intragovernmental: revenue
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">314</NUMEX>. Intragovernmental sales of goods and services by a
revolving fund.--The cost of providing goods or services by a
revolving fund is defrayed in whole or in part by selling the goods
or services provided. Intragovernmental sales may be made by an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> that maintains either an intragovernmental revolving
fund (such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Business Operations Fund</ENAMEX>) or a public
enterprise revolving fund (such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>). Each party
receives and sacrifices something of value. The proceeds are an
exchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">315</NUMEX>. Intragovernmental sales of goods and services by a fund
other than a revolving fund.--The cost of providing goods or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> is defrayed in whole or in part by selling the goods or
services provided. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and sacrifices something of
value. The proceeds are an exchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">316</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Employer entity</ENAMEX> contributions to pension and other
retirement benefit plans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> of the
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> provide service to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> in exchange
for compensation, of which some is received currently (the salary);
and some is deferred (pensions, retirement health benefits, and
other retirement benefits). This is an exchange transaction,
because each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> sacrifices value and receives value in return.
As part of this transaction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> promises a pension and
other retirement benefits (especially health benefits) to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> after they retire. The financing of these benefits may
include contributions paid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> to the retirement
fund.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">317</NUMEX>. In broad terms, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> contribution is an
inflow of resources to the retirement fund as part of this exchange
transaction. More narrowly, it is a payment by the employer entity
in exchange for the future provision of a pension or other
retirement benefit to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. Therefore, it is an exchange
revenue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that administers the retirement plan and thus
is an offset to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s gross cost in calculating its net
cost of operations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.63</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">318</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Employer entity</ENAMEX> contributions to health benefit plans for
current coverage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.--<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Employees</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government provide services to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> in exchange for
compensation, of which some is received currently in the form of
money (the salary); some is received currently in the form of
payments to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> contribution to the
medical insurance plan for current coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>); and
some is deferred (pensions and other retirement benefits). This is
an exchange transaction, because each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party</ENAMEX> sacrifices value and
receives value in return. As part of this exchange transaction, the
Government and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> both contribute to a medical insurance
plan that provides current coverage of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">319</NUMEX>. In broad terms, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> contribution is an
inflow of resources to the health benefits plan as part of this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX> transaction. More narrowly, it is a payment in exchange
for current coverage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> by a health
benefits plan. Therefore, it is an exchange revenue of the entity
that operates the health benefits plan and thus is an offset to
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s gross cost in determining its net cost of
operations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">320</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Employer entity</ENAMEX> payments for unemployment benefits and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> compensation.--The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> recognizes a liability
and an expense for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who are laid-off or injured on
the job and are entitled under law to unemployment benefits or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> compensation, respectively<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.64</NUMEX> The payment to the former or
current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> is made by the unemployment trust fund (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>) in the case of unemployment benefits and by the special
benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX>) in the case of workers
compensation. Unemployment benefits are reimbursed by the former
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> compensation costs are mostly charged
back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">321</NUMEX>. Since the costs are recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> and
its payment to the unemployment trust fund or the special benefits
fund reimburses these funds for the costs they incur, the amounts
these funds receive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> are exchange
revenues.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">322</NUMEX>. Interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities held by revolving funds.--A
revolving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> conducts a cycle of business-type operations in
which the expenses are incurred to produce goods and services that
generate revenue, and the revenue, in turn, finances expenses.
Revolving funds need capital in their operations and may invest
some of that

capital in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities. Since their holding of invested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">balances</ENAMEX> and the sale of goods and services are both integral to
the funds' operations, the interest on the funds' securities is
related to the funds' cost of operations just as is the revenue
earned from selling goods and services. Furthermore, the source of
the invested balances is predominantly revenue earned from their
sales of goods and services, for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funds</ENAMEX> incurred costs of
operations when that revenue was earned. The interest they receive
should therefore be classified in the same way as their revenue
earned from selling goods and services and should likewise be
deducted from gross cost in determining the net cost of operations.
For this reason, interest earned by revolving funds should normally
be classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">323</NUMEX>. The source of balances for some revolving funds may not be
predominantly exchange revenue. For such exceptions, as explained
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Basis for Conclusions</ENAMEX>, the interest should be classified in
the same way as the predominant source of balances rather than
according to the normal rule.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">324</NUMEX>. Interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities held by trust revolving
funds.--A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> revolving fund is a revolving fund that is also
classified by law as a trust fund. Like other revolving funds, it
earns exchange revenue, which is an offset to its gross cost. For
example, the revenue that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employees Health Benefit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> earns
from contributions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, annuitants, employer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Personnel Management</ENAMEX> (OPM) is an offset
to the insurance premiums that it pays to private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>. Trust
revolving funds need capital in their operations, just like other
revolving funds, the source of which is predominantly the revenue
they have earned. When some of their capital is invested in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities, the interest is related to their cost of
operations in the same way as the revenue earned from selling
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the source of the invested balances is
predominantly revenue earned from the sales of services, for which
they incurred costs of operations when the revenue was earned. The
interest they receive should therefore be classified in the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> as the interest received by other revolving funds, which is
exchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">325</NUMEX>. The source of balances for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> revolving funds may
not be predominantly exchange revenue. For such exceptions, as
explained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Basis for Conclusions</ENAMEX>, the interest should be
classified in the same way as the predominant source of balances
rather than according to the normal rule.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX>. Interest on uninvested funds received by direct loan and
guaranteed loan financing accounts.--A guaranteed loan financing
account holds uninvested balances as reserves against its loan
guarantee liabilities and earns interest on these balances that
adds to its resources to pay these liabilities. A direct loan
financing account may hold uninvested balances to bridge
transactions that are integral to its operations, such as when it
borrows from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> to disburse direct loans prior to the time of
disbursement; it earns interest on these balances to reflect the
time value of money and thereby finance the interest it pays on its
debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>. Thus, in both cases, the interest received by the
financing account is earned through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> transactions with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> and is an offset to the financing account's related costs
of operations. The interest is therefore an exchange revenue of the
financing account.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">327</NUMEX>. Interest received by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>.--Accounts or funds
(including direct loan and guaranteed loan financing accounts) may
be authorized to borrow from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> or from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> (an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>) or other sources. The
interest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> pays on its borrowings is a cost to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX> and an inflow of resources to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> may
be deemed to have borrowed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to finance the outlays
for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> borrowed, and thus to have incurred a
corresponding interest cost of its own. The interest received by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> is therefore related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s cost of
borrowing from the public and should be classified as an exchange
revenue.
Exchange transactions--intragovernmental: gains and losses
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">328</NUMEX>. Note: As explained in the introduction to this appendix,
transactions that are classified as producing gains or losses
should instead be classified as producing revenue or expense if
they are usual and recurring for a particular reporting entity.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">329</NUMEX>. Retirement of debt securities prior to maturity: revolving
funds and trust revolving funds.--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities held by
revolving funds and trust revolving funds are primarily issued in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> account series, which can generally be redeemed on
demand. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities held by these funds may also be
callable or redeemable on demand. If these debt securities are
retired before maturity, the difference, if any, between the
reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the extinguished
debt should be recognized as a gain or loss by the fund that owned
the securities. The gain or loss should be accounted for as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX> gain or loss if the interest on the associated debt
securities is classified as nonexchange revenue, and it should be
accounted for as an exchange gain or loss if the interest on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> debt securities is classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue. For
revolving funds and trust revolving funds, as explained elsewhere,
the interest is normally but not always an exchange revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX>. The difference, if any, between the reacquisition price and
the net carrying value of the extinguished debt should be
recognized as a loss or gain in accounting for interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
debt. The amount should be equal in absolute value but with the
opposite sign to the gain or loss recognized by the revolving fund
or trust revolving fund. The amount should be recognized as a gain
or loss from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> in order to offset it against the gross
interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> debt in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>-wide consolidated
financial statements.
Other financing sources--intragovernmental
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">331</NUMEX>. Appropriations.--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations</ENAMEX>--a form of budget
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>--permit an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to incur obligations and make payments
and thus are a means of financing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s cost. They are not
otherwise related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s cost and therefore are not an
offset to its gross cost in determining its net cost of operations.
They are not earned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s activities, demanded by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>, or donated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. Therefore, appropriations provide
an other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> instead of a revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">332</NUMEX>. More precisely, "appropriations used" is recognized as an
other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> in determining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s operating
results when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> receives goods and services or provides
benefits, grants, or other transfer payments. To avoid double
counting, appropriations used are not recognized for the
appropriation of earmarked revenues or other financing sources,
which are already counted in determining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s operating
results. Appropriations that have been made available for
apportionment but have not been used are recognized as "unexpended
appropriations" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s capital.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">333</NUMEX>. Cost subsidies: difference between internal sales price
(reimbursement) and full cost.--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> may receive goods or
services from another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> without paying the full cost of the
goods or services or without paying any cost at all. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
accounting standards may require the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to recognize
the full cost as an expense (or, if appropriate, as an asset). In
these cases the difference between full cost and the internal sales
price or reimbursement (sometimes called a "transfer price") is an
imputed cost to the receiving entity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.65</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">334</NUMEX>. The financing of the imputed cost is also imputed to the
receiving entity. Imputed financing is necessary so that the
imputed cost does not reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s operating results and net
position. The imputed financing equals the imputed cost and is
recognized as an other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. It is not a revenue,
because the receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> does not earn the amount imputed or
demand its payment.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">335</NUMEX>. Cost subsidies: difference between the service cost of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pensions</ENAMEX> (and other retirement benefits), less the employee
contributions, if any, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> contributions.--The
service cost of pensions (and other retirement benefits) to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX>, less the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> contributions, if any, is
recognized as a cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX>. The difference between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX>'s cost and its contributions, if any, is
imputed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> as part of its recognized cost. For
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pensions</ENAMEX>, the cost recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> is more than
its contribution for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who are covered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Service</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retirement System</ENAMEX> and several minor systems (in a few of which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> does not make any contributions toward the service
cost). For retirement health care benefits, neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> make any contributions while the employee
is working<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> cost is recognized as a
cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> and imputed to it.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">336</NUMEX>. The financing of the imputed cost is also imputed to the
employer entity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.67</NUMEX> The imputed financing is necessary so that the
imputed cost does not reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX>'s operating
results and net position. The imputed financing equals the imputed
cost and is recognized as an other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. It is not a
revenue, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> does not earn the amount
imputed or demand its payment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.68</NUMEX>
65See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAS No. 4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts</ENAMEX> and
Standards for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>, para. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">105-115</ENAMEX>.
66Retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> do pay premiums, however, and the service
cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> is defined net of the actuarial present
value of those future premiums.
67The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX>'s own contribution, if any, is generally
financed by an appropriation but could be financed by earned
revenue or other sources.
68For further discussion of the accounting standards for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pensions</ENAMEX> and other retirement benefits for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, see
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAS No. 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Liabilities of the Federal Government</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">para</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">56-93 and 148-181.</TIMEX> The standards do not cover accounting for
the plan per se as distinct from the administering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. Nor do
they cover defined contribution plans, or administrative entities
that are not Federal reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">337</NUMEX>. (This transaction differs from the immediately preceding
transaction, in which an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> does not pay the full cost of the
goods or services it receives from another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. In the present
case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer entity</ENAMEX> acquires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
itself, but another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> pays part of their cost.)
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">338</NUMEX>. Contribution by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX> trust
fund.--The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> makes a contribution to the SMI
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Medical Insurance</ENAMEX>) trust fund. This appropriated
payment is separate from the transfer of earmarked premiums and is
not a transfer of earmarked taxes or other income. It does not
arise from an exchange transaction, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX> does not sacrifice
any value to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> in exchange for the payment, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> does not receive anything of value from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX>. Instead,
the payment constitutes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> subsidy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX> trust
fund. Since the payment is not demanded or earned, it is an other
financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX> rather than a revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">339</NUMEX>. Examples of other payments of a similar nature (and also
classified as other financing sources) are the payment by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> to the social security trust funds for military
service credits and for certain uninsured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> at least 72 years
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>; and the payment by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railroad Retirement</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> for the vested dual benefit payments received by certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retirees</ENAMEX> under both the railroad retirement and the social security
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. The quinquennial military service credit adjustment paid
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> and the social security trust funds is
likewise an other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to the social security trust
funds but one that may be either positive or negative.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX>. Transfer by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</ENAMEX>.--The
Commodity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Corporation</ENAMEX> (CCC) makes transfers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crop Insurance Corporation</ENAMEX> (FCIC), which it finances by an
appropriation. This payment does not arise from an exchange
transaction, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCIC</ENAMEX> does not sacrifice anything of value to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCC</ENAMEX> does not receive anything of value from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCIC</ENAMEX>. It
differs from the contribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMI</ENAMEX> primarily in that it is paid
by another program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCC</ENAMEX>) rather than directly by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX>. Since the payment is not demanded or earned, it is an
other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCIC</ENAMEX> rather than a revenue.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">341</NUMEX>. Interchange between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railroad Retirement Board</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital Insurance</ENAMEX> trust funds.--The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railroad</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retirement Board</ENAMEX> pays benefits equivalent to the amounts that would
have been paid if railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> had been covered under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> since its inception, plus additional amounts unique to
that program. The railroad retirement program is partly financed by
an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> financial interchange that takes place between the
Railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account</ENAMEX> (a trust fund)
and the trust funds for old-age and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> insurance, disability
insurance, and hospital insurance (OASDHI). The interchange is
designed to place each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDHI</ENAMEX> trust funds in the same
position as it would have been if railroad employment had been
covered under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> since its inception.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">342</NUMEX>. The amount of the payment reflects the difference between
(a) the benefits that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDHI</ENAMEX> trust funds would have paid to
railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> if railroad employment had been
covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDHI</ENAMEX> and (b) the payroll taxes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDHI</ENAMEX> trust
funds would have received if railroad employment had been covered
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDHI</ENAMEX>. If benefits would have exceeded taxes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDHI</ENAMEX> trust
funds make a payment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railroad Social Security Equivalent</ENAMEX>
Benefit Account; if benefits would have been less, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASDHI</ENAMEX> trust
funds receive a payment. Currently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OASI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DI</ENAMEX> make payments to
that Account, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> receives payment. The interchange differs from
the examples in the previous cases primarily in that (a) the
payment is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between two</NUMEX> trust funds and (b) the payment may be made
in either direction.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">343</NUMEX>. The financial interchange does not arise from an exchange
transaction, because it is a reallocation of resources among funds,
all of which are financed primarily from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nonexchange</TIMEX> revenue.
Furthermore, the nature of this reallocation is such that the
transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> does not receive anything of value and the
recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> does not sacrifice anything of value. Therefore,
the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> recognizes the transfer-in as an other
financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, and the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> recognizes the
transfer-out as a negative financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">344</NUMEX>. Transfer of cash and other capitalized assets without
reimbursement.--Cash and other capitalized assets may be
transferred without reimbursement from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to
another. Cash may include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue that is recognized by
the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> in determining its net cost of operations
but is required to be transferred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> or another
entity; other capitalized assets may include general property,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment. The receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> does not sacrifice
anything of value, and the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> does not acquire
anything of value. Therefore, the transfer is not an exchange
transaction. The receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> recognizes the transfer-in as an
other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>; the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> recognizes the
transfer-out as a negative financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. The amount recorded by
both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> is the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s book value of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">345</NUMEX>. Transfer of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment without
reimbursement: types that are expensed.--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Property</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> (PP&E) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> that are expensed (i.e., stewardship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>) may be transferred from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to another.
If the asset was classified as stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> in its entirety
by both the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, the
transfer does not affect the net cost of operations or net position
of either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and therefore in such a case it is not a revenue,
a gain or loss, or other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">346</NUMEX>. However, if the asset that is transferred was classified as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general PP&E</ENAMEX> for the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> but stewardship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> for the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, it is recognized as a
transfer-out (a negative other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>) of capitalized
assets by the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.
REVALUATIONS
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">347</NUMEX>. Revaluation of capitalized property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment.</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capitalized</ENAMEX> property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment (PP&E)
may be removed from the general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> accounts if it no longer
provides service in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> because it has
suffered damage, become obsolete in advance of expectations, or is
identified as excess. It is recorded as an asset at its expected
net realizable value. Any difference between the book value and the
expected net realizable value is recognized as a gain or loss in
determining the net cost of operations, because the revaluation
results from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s operations. The expected net realizable
value is adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end of each</TIMEX> period, and any further
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revaluation</ENAMEX> is also recognized as a gain or loss in determining the
net cost of operations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.69</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">348</NUMEX>. Since the revaluation does not affect obligations incurred
but does affect net cost, an amount equal to the revaluation is
recognized in determining the reconciliation between obligations
incurred and net cost of operations. A reconciliation is not needed
in determining the change in net position, because the revaluation
affects net cost and net position equally.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">349</NUMEX>. Revaluation of inventory and related property.--Inventory
and related property may be revalued for such reasons as
determination that the property is excess, obsolete, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unserviceable</ENAMEX>; that stockpile materials have decayed or been
damaged; that a loss is estimated on commodity purchase agreements;
or that a change has occurred in the net realizable value of
commodities valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
The amount of revaluation is recognized as a loss or a gain in
determining the net cost of operations, because it results from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s operations. Assets are correspondingly reduced or
increased<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.70</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX>. Since the revaluation does not affect obligations incurred,
but does affect net cost, an amount equal to the revaluation is
recognized in determining the reconciliation between obligations
incurred and net cost of operations. A reconciliation is not needed
in determining the change in net position, because the revaluation
affects net cost and net position equally.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TRANSACTIONS NOT RECOGNIZED AS REVENUES</ENAMEX>, GAINS, OR OTHER
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FINANCING SOURCES</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">351</NUMEX>. Borrowing from the public.--Borrowing from the public is a
means of financing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s outlays. However, it is not a
net inflow of resources to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> or other borrowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,
because the asset received (cash) is offset by an equal liability
(debt). Therefore, it is not revenue or an other financing
source.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">352</NUMEX>. Borrowing from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX>, or
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> accounts.-- An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> may be provided the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> to borrow from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX>, or
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> accounts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intragovernmental</ENAMEX> borrowing is a means
of financing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s outlays. However, it is not a net inflow
of resources to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, because the asset received (cash) is
offset by an equal liability (debt). Therefore, it is not revenue
or an other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">353</NUMEX>. Disposition of revenue to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>: custodial
transfers.--Revenue, primarily nonexchange revenue, may be
collected by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> acting on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> or
another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> on whose behalf it was
collected. The collecting entity accounts for the disposition of
revenue as part of its custodial activity. These custodial
transfers, by definition, do not affect the collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s net
cost of operations or operating results, nor are they part of the
reconciliation between its obligations and net cost of operations.

recognizes the revenue as nonexchange or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> revenue,
depending on its nature, according to the applicable revenue
standards.)
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">354</NUMEX>. Sales of different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> assets.--The sale of
Government assets (other than forfeited property) is an exchange
transaction, because each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> receives and sacrifices something
of value. As a general rule, any difference between the sales
proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX> is sold. The remainder of the transaction does not provide a
net inflow of resources, so no gain, revenue, or other financing
source is recognized. If the sales proceeds equal book value, there
is no gain or loss, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> asset for another
of equal recorded value is not a net inflow of resources.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">355</NUMEX>. This general rule applies to property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>, receivables (other than direct loans), foreclosed
property associated with pre-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> direct loans and loan guarantees,
and miscellaneous assets. It does not apply to inventory, nor does
it apply to forfeited property (as explained in the previous
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nonexchange</TIMEX> revenue). It also does not apply to the sale
of direct loans and the sale of foreclosed property associated with
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">post-1991</ENAMEX> direct loans and loan guarantees. The latter transactions
are discussed in subsequent paragraphs.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">356</NUMEX>. Acquisition of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment through
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX>.--The cost of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment (PP&E)
acquired through an exchange of assets with the public is the fair
value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>. If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired is more readily determinable
than that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered, the cost is the fair value
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired. If neither fair value is determinable,
the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired is the cost recorded for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered net of any accumulated depreciation or
amortization. In the event that cash consideration is included in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired is increased (or
decreased) by the amount of the cash surrendered (or
received)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.71</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">357</NUMEX>. Any difference between the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired
and the book value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered is recognized as a
gain or loss. If the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> acquired equals the book
value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered, there is no gain or loss (nor a
revenue or other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>), because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of one
asset for another of equal value does not provide a net inflow of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the amount of the transaction equal to the
book value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> surrendered is not recognized as a gain,
a revenue, or an other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">358</NUMEX>. Transfer of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment without
reimbursement: types that are expensed.--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Property</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> (PP&E) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> that are expensed (i.e., stewardship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>) may be transferred from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to another.
If the asset was classified as stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> in its entirety
by both the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, the
transfer does not affect the net cost of operations or net position
of either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and therefore in such a case it is not a revenue,
a gain or loss, or other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">359</NUMEX>. However, if the asset that is transferred was classified as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general PP&E</ENAMEX> for the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> but stewardship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> for the recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, it is recognized as a
transfer-out (a negative other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>) of capitalized
assets by the
71See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAS No. 6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting for Property</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant</ENAMEX>, and

transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>. If multi-use heritage assets are transferred and some cost
was recognized for them on the books of the transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,
that cost is recognized as a transfer-out (a negative other
financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>) of capitalized assets. No amount is recognized by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that receives the asset<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.72</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">361</NUMEX>. Donation of property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment: types that are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expensed</ENAMEX>.--The acquisition cost of stewardship property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> (PP&E) is recognized as a cost when incurred. Such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>, heritage assets, and
stewardship land. When such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> is donated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>,
however, no amount is recognized as a cost<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.73</NUMEX> Since the donation of
such PP&E does not affect the net cost or net position of the
recipient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, it is not a revenue, a gain, or an other
financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">362</NUMEX>. Negative subsidies on post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> direct loans and loan
guarantees.--A negative subsidy means that the direct loans or loan
guarantees are estimated to make a profit, apart from
administrative costs (which are excluded from the subsidy
calculation by law). The amount of the subsidy cost is recognized
as an expense when the direct loan or guaranteed loan is disbursed.
A negative subsidy is recognized as a direct reduction in expense,
not as a revenue, gain, or other financing source<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.74</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">363</NUMEX>. Downward subsidy reestimates for post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> direct loans and
loan guarantees.--A downward subsidy reestimate means that the
subsidy cost of direct loans or loan guarantees is estimated to be
less than had previously been estimated. The initial subsidy cost
is recognized as an expense; a positive subsidy reestimate is
recognized as an expense; and a downward subsidy reestimate is
recognized as a direct reduction in expense, not as a revenue,
gain, or other financing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">364</NUMEX>. Fees on post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> direct loans and loan guarantees.--The
present value of estimated fees is included as an offset in
calculating the subsidy cost of direct loans and loan guarantees,
which is recognized as an expense when the loans are disbursed. The
present value of estimated fees is likewise included as one
component in calculating the value of loans receivable or loan
guarantee liabilities. When cash is received in payment of fees,
the loans receivable decrease by an equal amount (or the loan
guarantee liabilities increase by an equal amount). The increase in
one asset is offset by an equal decrease in another asset (or by an
equal increase in liabilities). Therefore, fees are not recognized
as a revenue, a gain, or an other financing source<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.75</NUMEX>

The fee component of the subsidy cost is required to be
disclosed separately.
repayments is included in the calculation of the subsidy cost of
direct loans, and this subsidy cost is recognized as an expense
when the loans are disbursed. The present value of estimated loan
repayments is likewise included in the value of the loans
receivable. When cash is received for the repayment of loans, the
loans receivable decrease by an equal amount. The increase in one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX> is offset by an equal decrease in another asset. Therefore,
cash inflow from the repayment is not recognized as a revenue, a
gain, or an other financing source<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.76</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">366</NUMEX>. Repayment of pre-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> direct loans.--When pre-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> direct
loans are repaid in whole or in part, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity exchanges</ENAMEX> one
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX> (loans receivable) for another (cash) with equal value. There
is no net inflow of resources. Therefore, the amount of cash inflow
equal to book value is not recognized as a revenue, a gain, or an
other financing source<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.77</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">367</NUMEX>. Repayment of receivables: except direct loans.--When
receivables other than direct loans are paid or repaid in whole or
in part, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity exchanges</ENAMEX> one asset (loans receivable) for
another (cash) with equal value. There is no net inflow of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the amount of cash inflow equal to book value
is not recognized as a revenue, a gain, or an other financing
source<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.78</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">368</NUMEX>. Sales of direct loans.--The sale of a direct loan is a
modification according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Federal Credit Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>
regardless of whether the loan being sold was obligated after FY
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> or before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FY</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. The book value loss (or gain) on a sale of
direct loans equals the book value of the loans sold (prior to
sale) minus the net proceeds of the sale. It normally differs from
the cost of modification, which is recognized as an expense<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.79</NUMEX> Any
difference between the book value loss (or gain) and the cost of
modification is recognized as a gain or loss.80 The amount of cash
inflow equal to book value is not a net inflow of resources to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>, because it is an exchange of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> asset for another of equal
recorded value. Therefore, the amount of cash inflow equal to book
value is not recognized as a revenue, a gain, or an other financing
source.
76
If the actual repayment is different from the previous estimate,
the present value of the difference between cash inflows and
outflows over the term of the loan--calculated as of the date of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disbursement</ENAMEX>--is reestimated and is recognized as a subsidy expense
or a reduction in subsidy expense.
77
If the loan is not repaid, the unpaid amount is recognized as an
adjustment to the bad debt allowance and does not affect revenue,
gains, or other financing sources.
78
If the receivable is not repaid, the unpaid amount is recognized
as an adjustment to the bad debt allowance and does not affect
revenue, gains, or other financing sources.
79
This difference is due to the different interest rates used to
discount future cash flows for calculating the subsidy cost (and
subsidy allowance) when the loan is disbursed and for calculating
the cost of modification at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a later time</TIMEX>. If the sale is with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recourse</ENAMEX>, the present value of the estimated loss from the recourse
is also recognized as an expense.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">369</NUMEX>. Sales of foreclosed property: associated with post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1991</NUMEX>
direct loans and loan guarantees.--The net present value of the
cash flow from the estimated sales of foreclosed property is
included in calculating the subsidy cost of post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> direct loans
and loan guarantees. This subsidy cost is recognized as an expense
when the loans are disbursed. When property is foreclosed, the
property is recognized as an asset at the net present value of its
estimated net cash flows. When the foreclosed property is sold, any
difference between the sales proceeds and the book value (i.e., the
net present value as of the time of sale) requires a reestimate of
the subsidy expense, which is recognized as a subsidy expense or a
reduction in subsidy expense. The amount of cash flow equal to book
value is an exchange of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> asset for another of equal recorded
value and therefore is not recognized as a gain, a revenue, or an
other financing source<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.81</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">370</NUMEX>. Deposit fund transactions.--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deposit</ENAMEX> funds are accounts
outside the budget that record amounts that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> (a)
holds temporarily until ownership is determined or (b) holds as an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for others. The standards and guidance in this Statement do
not apply to deposit funds except insofar as a particular deposit
fund may be classified as part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> or a
disclosure may be required due to a fiduciary relationship on the
part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> toward a deposit fund.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUMMARY</ENAMEX>
This Statement establishes standards for reporting on the
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s stewardship over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) certain resources
entrusted to it, identified as stewardship property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> and stewardship investments, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) certain
responsibilities assumed by it, identified as the current service
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>. The resources and responsibilities do not meet the
criteria for assets and liabilities that are required to be
reported in the financial statements but are, nonetheless,
important to an understanding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and financial
condition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> at the date of the financial
statements and in subsequent periods. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> has
been entrusted with, and made accountable for, these resources and
responsibilities, they should be recognized in the financial
reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and of its component
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>.
Stewardship resources are investments by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>
for the benefit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Nation</ENAMEX>. When made, they are treated as
expenses in the financial statements. These expenses, however, are
intended to provide long-term benefits to the public. Therefore,
this Statement requires that information on these resources be
reported to highlight their long-term-benefit nature and to
demonstrate accountability over them. Depending on the nature of
the resources, stewardship reporting could consist of financial and
nonfinancial data.
This Statement also establishes a standard for reporting
projections that will aid in assessing the sufficiency of future
budgetary resources to sustain public services and meet obligations
as they come due.
This Statement establishes reporting requirements based on the
categories defined below:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship Property</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equipment</ENAMEX> (PP&E) - property
owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and meeting the definition of one
of the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories:


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Assets</ENAMEX> - property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment of
historical, natural, cultural, educational, or artistic
significance.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Mission PP&E</ENAMEX> - property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">integral</ENAMEX> to certain unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> missions.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship Land</ENAMEX> - land other than that acquired for or
in connection with general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship Investments</ENAMEX> - items treated as expenses in
calculating net cost but meriting special treatment to highlight
their substantial investment and long-term-benefit nature. This
includes:


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonfederal Physical Property</ENAMEX> - grants provided for
properties financed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>, but owned by the
state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.


•
Costs incurred for education and training programs that
are designed to increase or maintain national economic productive
capacity and research efforts to provide future benefits or
returns. These include: -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Capital</ENAMEX> - education and training
programs financed by


the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> for the benefit of the public. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Research</ENAMEX>
and Development - basic and applied research and development.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewardship Responsibilities</ENAMEX> - the projected financial impact on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> of sustaining current services that it provides.
Projections of current services provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> aid in
assessing the sufficiency of future budgetary resources to sustain
public services and meet obligations as they come due. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>, termed a Current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Assessment</ENAMEX>, provides receipt
and outlay data on the basis of projections of future
activities.
All stewardship information is deemed "required supplemental
stewardship information" (RSSI). Audit requirements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSSI</ENAMEX> will
be established in a collaborative effort by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>).

explanations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Concepts Statement, Objectives of Federal Financial</ENAMEX>
Reporting was developed on the basis of an in-depth assessment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs and is used to guide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
accounting and reporting standards. The objectives cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>: budgetary integrity, operating performance, stewardship, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and control.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>.
This Statement of accounting standards addresses the
objective of reporting on stewardship over certain resources
entrusted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and responsibilities assumed by
it. The need for a report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>'s stewardship
over the resources entrusted to it and the responsibilities it has
assumed, arises because of the unique nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government, as described in the following section.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEWARDSHIP AND THE REPORTING OBJECTIVES</ENAMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial</ENAMEX> position" is a representation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
economic resources and the claims on those resources as of a
particular date. In the private sector, the principal objective of
reporting on financial position is to assess the viability of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>, the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, and its potential
profitability.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.
Assessing the overall performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government is not exclusively a matter of comparing revenue and
expense, or its accumulated assets and liabilities.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>'s viability and perpetuity are
assumed. It has unique access to financial resources and financing,
and the power to tax, to borrow, and to create money. For the
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>, financial performance is a vital issue, but
traditional financial measures provide data that are appropriate
for assessing only some, not all, of the responsibilities for which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> should be held accountable. Since it exists not to
make a profit but to serve the needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> and to promote
the general welfare of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>, other measures of accountability
need to be used. Measures of accountability are to be reported for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> that are defined as stewardship property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX> (PP&E); stewardship investments; and stewardship
responsibilities. These elements of stewardship exist because the
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> is dissimilar to industrial and commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>.


Financial Condition
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. The measures of accountability mentioned above help to
portray the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s "financial condition." Financial condition
is a broader and more forward-looking concept than is financial
position. Financial condition allows an assessment of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> on
the basis of additional data that could include financial and
nonfinancial information about current conditions. These additional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> provide a more complete indication of performance. In some
cases, it may be necessary to present and characterize financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in ways that differ from traditional financial reporting and
to supplement traditional data with nonfinancial data. In other
cases, it may be necessary to rely almost entirely on nonfinancial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to provide a more complete presentation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> performance.
Moreover, assessment of financial condition could include analysis
of trends, demands, commitments, events, and uncertainties<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Stewardship PP&E</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship PP&E</ENAMEX>" consists of items whose physical
properties resemble those of general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> traditionally
capitalized in financial statements. However, the nature of these
Federal physical assets that are classified as stewardship PP&E
differ from general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> in that their values may be
indeterminable or may have little meaning (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collections</ENAMEX>, monuments, assets acquired in the formation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>) or that allocating the cost of such assets (for example,
military weapons systems and space exploration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hardware</ENAMEX>) to
accounting periods that benefit from the ownership of such assets
is meaningless. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> should be able to
demonstrate accountability for stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> by reporting on
its existence and on its condition by a reference to deferred
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maintenance</ENAMEX> reported in the financial statements. Stewardship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> would include stewardship land (that is, land not acquired
for or in connection with general property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment);
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> assets (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> monuments and memorials and
historically or culturally significant property); and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment (for example, space
exploration and military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons systems</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship Investments</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. "Stewardship investments" are substantial investments made
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> for the benefit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. When
incurred, they are treated as expenses in determining the net costs
of operations. However, these items merit special treatment so that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> financial reports know the extent of these
investments that are made for long-term benefit. Such investments
will be measured in terms of expenses incurred for certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and training programs; federally financed research and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>; and federally financed but not federally owned
property, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 7 of the Objectives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Reporting</ENAMEX>
provides a full discussion of financial position and financial
condition.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> has been entrusted with and made
accountable for these resources, they should be reported in the
financial reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> and of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component entities</ENAMEX>.
This will help satisfy the stewardship objective defined in the
concepts statement, Objectives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial Reporting</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAC No. 1</ENAMEX>. The goal of the stewardship objective is that the
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> "report on the broad outcomes of its actions."
Such reporting may provide information that could help report users
assess the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s operations and investments
for the period<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewardship Responsibilities</ENAMEX>


14.
A key aspect of the stewardship objective requires that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> reporting provide information that helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> determine
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s financial condition improved or
deteriorated over the period and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) whether future budgetary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> will likely be sufficient to sustain public services and
to meet obligations as they come due<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">.6</TIMEX>


15.
Information on "stewardship responsibilities" will aid in
these determinations. It will provide an essential perspective on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>'s commitment to discretionary and mandatory
programs.


16.
Reporting on this stewardship responsibility may be
accomplished in a stewardship section in the consolidated financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report of the Federal Government</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEWARDSHIP CATEGORIES OR ELEMENTS</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>. In defining the specific categories of items, or elements,
that would appear as stewardship information, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> decided on
the following:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">• Property</ENAMEX> owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and meeting the
definition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories:
-Property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment of historical, natural,
cultural, educational or artistic significance, referred to as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> assets, for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Monument</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Memorial</ENAMEX>;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAC No. 1</ENAMEX>, pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41-42</NUMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibid.</ENAMEX>, pp. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42-44</NUMEX>.
-Property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment that are integral to meeting a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unique Federal</ENAMEX> mission, referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal mission7</ENAMEX> property,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment (PP&E), and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Investments</ENAMEX> in stewardship land<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,8</NUMEX> that is, land not acquired
for or in connection with general property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment,
for example, national forests, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. Some
investments in stewardship land, for example national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, will
be reported by both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the number of acres used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> or an
historic site in the stewardship land category, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) by the
number of physical units identified as national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> assets category. Such reporting would not be considered
duplication, as the type of information reported on an item would
be different for each category of stewardship asset.


•
Properties financed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> but owned
by state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, referred to as nonfederal physical
property, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>.


•
Expenses that are incurred for education and training
that are intended to increase national economic productive capacity
or for research and development that are intended to provide future
benefits or returns. This includes:


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Investments</ENAMEX> in human capital, that is, education and training
programs provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>, for example, job
training programs, and grants for higher education.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Investments</ENAMEX> in research and development, for example, research
on the effects of early medical intervention in delaying the onset
of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDs</ENAMEX> symptoms in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
investment in genetic code research to advance national medical
research.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">• Information</ENAMEX> on the projected financial impact on the
Government of providing current services, assuming a continuation
of current programs. This information will be in the form of a
current services assessment providing future receipt and outlay
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on the basis of projections of future activities
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
The term "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission" refers to activities that are
typically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> defense. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission PP&E</ENAMEX> is limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> that would not typically be
used by non-federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. Clearly, any functions performed by a
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> could be broadly labeled "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission." The
definition of this category, however, clarifies the characteristics
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> appropriately included in this category--a much
narrower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than inferred by the category's title.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> is including only surface land as supplementary
stewardship information because the issues associated with other
than surface land, i.e., the natural resources on and under that
land, are complex. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> is researching these complex issues
and will publish a separate exposure draft on a proposed accounting
standard for natural resources at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later date</TIMEX>.
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> as a whole and will include both
discretionary and mandatory programs and interest on debt.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>. The previous categories of items or elements result from or
exist largely because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>'s role as a
sovereign power. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> that they include are defined and
discussed in detail in their respective chapters of this
standard.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nature of Stewardship Reporting</ENAMEX>


19.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>, recognizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>'s size,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexity</ENAMEX>, diversity, and impact on others, has determined that
the aforementioned information is needed in addition to that
included in financial statements.


20.
Such information may not link directly with the basic
financial statements because the data to be reported may be other
than financial, for example, physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> or projections. It will
supplement the basic financial statements.


21.
This information, as indicated in each of the standards,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">will be designated</ENAMEX> as required supplementary stewardship
information (RSSI) for the consolidated financial statements of the
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> who have stewardship
responsibilities over resources identified earlier in this
document. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> has chosen to call this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSSI</ENAMEX> to distinguish it
from "required supplementary information" (RSI), for which audit
responsibilities are prescribed in existing professional
literature. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> should establish
and cause the implementation of the audit responsibilities for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSSI</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION</ENAMEX>


22.
Stewardship information may be presented in varying
formats depending on the nature of the Federal investments or
claims to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal resources</ENAMEX> controlled by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. Such
information is required for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) that control
stewardship resources and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) whose financial statements purport to
be in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> accounting principles as recommended
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX>, and approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB and the Comptroller General</ENAMEX>.


23.
Examples of selected portions of stewardship report
sections are included at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix B.</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEASUREMENT</ENAMEX>


24.
The separate standards for each stewardship element
contain specific guidance for that element. In general, however,
stewardship investments shall be measured on the same basis of
accounting as used for financial statements, including appropriate
accrual adjustments, general and administrative overhead, and a
share of the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> (for example,
depreciation)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>


25.
For investments that are intended to maintain or increase
the economic productive capacity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>, that is,
investments in human capital, research and development, and
nonfederal physical property, trend data shall be presented. Trend
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> should reflect the full cost (including allocation of facility
and administrative costs) of the investment.


26.
For stewardship land and heritage assets, measurement
will be done on other than a financial basis. For example,
measurement may be on the basis of physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, such as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of
land. Specific data requirements are addressed in the individual
stewardship standards.


27.
Generally, amounts shall be reported in nominal dollars.
If trend data that span <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> are reported and the entity
believes that constant dollar information would be meaningful for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> interpretation, constant dollar data may be provided in
addition to nominal dollar data.


28.
Split Grants. Frequently, stewardship elements are
financed by grants. In some cases, the grants may have more than
one purpose<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> For such grants, the investment shall be allocated
among stewardship elements on the basis of an estimate of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proportionate</ENAMEX> funding of the various grant objectives. If
allocation is not feasible, the investment shall be reported on the
basis of the predominant use of the grant.


29.
Performance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indicators</ENAMEX>. For some stewardship elements,
categorization of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> as investments is predicated on
producing outputs and outcomes. The specific procedures, including
a phasing-in process for requiring such justification, is contained
in the individual respective standards.


30.
Reporting Program Expenses. Trend data reported on
stewardship investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> should reflect the full <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cost11</NUMEX> of
the investment for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> being reported upon and the preceding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Additional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>' data also may be reported if such data
would better indicate the investment nature of an item.


9See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards</ENAMEX>, SFFAS
No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, for a discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> cost accounting principles and
standards.
10
An example of a grant with a split purpose is a grant issued to
a teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> to perform both medical education and medical
research.
11See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards</ENAMEX>, SFFAS
No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, for a discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> cost accounting principles and
standards.


31.
In some cases, before the issuance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> accounting
standards, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> have maintained records on the basis of outlays
rather than expenses. It may be impracticable for such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> to
reconstruct their accounts on the basis of expense. In such cases,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX> may report data on an outlay basis for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any years</TIMEX> for which
expense data are not available. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 5 years</TIMEX>, entities
should have sufficient expense data to be able to report expenses
rather than outlays.


32.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reporting Deferred Maintenance</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of Congressional oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, and
national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, have raised the issue of the deteriorating
condition of federally-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> because of deferred
maintenance associated with these assets. The issue was addressed
in association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>. As a result, a deferred maintenance
standard in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting for Property</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equipment</ENAMEX>, SFFAS
No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, establishes reporting requirements related to the condition
and future maintenance requirements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>.


33.
These requirements are flexible since different
conditions may be considered acceptable by different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, as
well as for different items of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> held by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.
The deferred maintenance standard is applicable to all PP&E
whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> is reported as general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> or stewardship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</ENAMEX>


34.
Within each of the standards, minimum required and, in
some cases, recommended reporting is described. These requirements
and recommendations, including a phasing-in process for entities
who may not have required data available at the implementation of
the standards, are contained in the individual standards. These
requirements describe the nature of items to be reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
entities; guidance on the form and content of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> financial
reports, including the specific guidance on the format in which
items addressed in this Statement will be reported, will be
prescribed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>.


35.
Reporting should be at the major program or category
level; individual transactions need not be reported unless
significant. Additional reporting is encouraged when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preparers</ENAMEX>
believe such information would make the financial report more
meaningful or understandable.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOCIAL INSURANCE</ENAMEX>


36.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> first considered accounting and reporting for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> insurance programs while considering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAS No. 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Liabilities of the Federal Government</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> concluded, at
that time, that the topic should be made part of the Supplementary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship Reporting</ENAMEX> project.


37.
Research and deliberations regarding social insurance
have continued as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Stewardship Reporting</ENAMEX>
project. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>, recognizing the magnitude and
complexity of these programs, the strength of the views on the
accounting and reporting issues, the significant attention being
focused on these programs at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the present time</TIMEX>, and the potential
for change to the programs, has again


concluded that additional consideration is appropriate before
issuing final guidance. Accordingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> has not included
guidance on social insurance in this Statement and has added a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Insurance Accounting</ENAMEX> project to its agenda.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APPLICABILITY</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>. This standard requires that the consolidated financial
reports12 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and the financial reports12 of
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component units</ENAMEX> contain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSSI</ENAMEX> relating to:


•
amounts invested in human capital, research and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, and nonfederal physical property; and


•
quantities (stated in terms of physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX>)
of land, heritage assets, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission property.


Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> do not set accounting standards for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislative</ENAMEX> or judicial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> accounting standards
would be appropriate for them.


39.
Because the financial reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>
present the aggregation of information about stewardship
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">investments</ENAMEX> and assets related to varied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and programs,
further deliberations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> are needed to reach a decision
on the amount and nature of information to be required under this
standard for reporting in the consolidated financial report.
Accordingly, except for the standard described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 8</ENAMEX>,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Current Service Assessment</ENAMEX>," the effective date of the stewardship
standards as they apply to the consolidated financial report, is
deferred pending that decision. The effective date of the standard
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 8</ENAMEX> is for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal periods beginning</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 30</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. In the interim, the consolidated financial reports should
include such summary or selected information as is feasible.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Experimentation</ENAMEX> is encouraged, as is the reporting of such
additional information as will enhance the financial
report.


40.
Some Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, including those government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Corporation Control Act</ENAMEX> and
certain others, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Postal Service</ENAMEX>, are required by law
or policy to publish financial statements pursuant to the standards
issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Accounting Standards Board</ENAMEX> (FASB). (Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX> also may be required to prepare statements pursuant to
standards set by a regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. That practice would not be
affected by this statement of standards.) For such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX> provides the following general principles:


12
The terms "financial statements" and "consolidated financial
statements" are used throughout this document to refer to the basic
financial statements of a reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>; the basic financial
statements normally include: the balance sheet, the statements of
net cost, changes in financial position, financing, budgetary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, and custodial activities and the notes to the financial
statements. The terms "financial reports" and "consolidated
financial reports" are used to refer to a document which would
include the financial statements but which would also include items
such as: a management discussion and analysis section, a statement
of program performance measures, required supplemental information
or required supplementary stewardship information not included in
the financial statements or other supplemental financial and
management information.


•
Applying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applicable Accounting Principles</ENAMEX> - Separately
issued (stand-alone) general-purpose financial statements on such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX> should apply applicable accounting principles that will
best meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs and comply with any relevant statutory
requirements. This principle would continue to be true for
separately issued statements even if, pursuant to the provisions
below, other information about these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> might need to be
presented when their financial statements are included within
reports of a larger Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.


•
Reporting Additional or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Information</ENAMEX> - When
financial information on such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> is included in
general-purpose financial reports of a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> reporting
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s consolidated financial report), any
applicable standards recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> and issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>) that call for additional
reporting or supplementary information should be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX>.


•
Applying <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Applicable Standards When Differences Arise</ENAMEX> -
When financial information on such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> is included in general
purpose financial reports of a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> reporting entity
(including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s consolidated financial report), standards
recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> and issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> should be used if
the difference arising from differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> accounting
standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASB</ENAMEX>'s would be material to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the report of
the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CHAPTER 2</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HERITAGE ASSETS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Assets</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> assets shall be reported as required supplementary
stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component units</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government responsible for such assets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> assets shall be
reported in terms of physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> rather than cost, fair value,
or other monetary values.
DEFINITION
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> assets" are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> that are unique for one or
more of the following reasons:


•
historical or natural significance;


•
cultural, educational or artistic (for example,
aesthetic) importance; or


•
significant architectural characteristics.




44.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> assets are generally expected to be preserved
indefinitely. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example of evidence that a particular asset is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> in nature is that it is listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Register</ENAMEX> of
Historic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Places</ENAMEX>.


45.
Some investments in heritage assets, for example national
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parks</ENAMEX>, will be reported by both <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the number of physical units
identified as national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> in the heritage assets category, and
by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) the number of acres used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> or an historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> in the
stewardship land category (see <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX> of this document). Such
reporting would not be considered duplication, as the type of
information reported on an item would be different for each
category of stewardship asset.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEASUREMENT</ENAMEX>


46.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> assets shall be quantified in terms of physical
units (for example, number of items in collections or the number of
national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>). No asset amount shall be shown on the balance
sheet of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> financial statements for heritage
assets.


47.
The costs of acquiring, constructing, improving,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reconstructing</ENAMEX>, or renovating heritage assets shall be considered
an expense in the period incurred when determining


the net cost of operations.13 The cost shall include all costs
incurred to bring the heritage asset to its current condition and
location.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MULTI-USE HERITAGE ASSETS</ENAMEX>


48.
Not all heritage assets are used solely for heritage
purposes--some serve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> purposes by providing reminders of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> and by being used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> government operations
unrelated to the assets themselves. The cost of renovating,
improving, or reconstructing operating components of heritage
assets used in Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> shall be included in general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>. The renovation, improvement, or reconstruction costs to
facilitate Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> (for example, installation of
communication wiring or redesign of office space) would be
capitalized and depreciated over its expected useful life. The cost
should not be depreciated over an unrealistically long
life.


49.
Costs of renovating or reconstructing the heritage asset
that cannot be associated directly with operations shall be
considered heritage asset costs and included as expense in
calculating net costs.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MINIMUM REPORTING</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the most relevant information to be
presented should be made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preparer</ENAMEX>; however, reporting at the
entity level shall be more specific than at the governmentwide
level. The following are examples of information that should be
considered for presentation:


•
Description of each major category of heritage
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX>.


•
The number of physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> added and withdrawn from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> asset records during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and the end-of-year number
of physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> for each type of heritage asset. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> assets
consist of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) collection-type heritage assets, such as objects
gathered and maintained for exhibition, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collections</ENAMEX>, art collections, and library collections; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
noncollection-type heritage assets, such as, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, memorials,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monuments</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.


•

assets transferred from other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, and heritage assets
acquired through donation or devise, see the general PP&E
standard contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting for Property</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant</ENAMEX>, and

DEFINITION


52.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">items</ENAMEX> used to meet a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> mission in which the specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP&E</ENAMEX> used is
an integral part of the output of the mission<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> should be
considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> if it possesses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of
each of the two types of characteristics presented below. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> type
of characteristic relates to the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>,
and the other relates to its useful life.


53.
Characteristics related to the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> are that it




•
has no expected nongovernmental alternative uses;
or


•
is held for use in the event of emergency, war or natural
disaster; or


•
is specifically designed for use in a program for which
there is no other program or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> or nonfederal) using
similar PP&E with which to compare costs.


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>. Characteristics related to the useful life are that it


•
has an indeterminate or an unpredictable useful life17
because of the unusual manner in which it is used, improved,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retired</ENAMEX>, modified or maintained, or


•
is at a very high risk of being destroyed during use or
of premature obsolescence.


16
The name "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>" may cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to
erroneously assume that this category should include any PP&E
supporting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> is limited
to those items specifically identified herein as well as any other
items exhibiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> characteristic from each of the two
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> listed.
17
This may be evidenced by the ability (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to retire the PP&E
and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> return it to service or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to continually upgrade the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> to maintain its usefulness.


55.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission PP&E excludes land whether the land
is general PP&E land or stewardship land.


56.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>, however, specifically includes
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) weapons systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX> or attack
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX>, submarines, and tracked combat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) space
exploration equipment (for example, space hardware and launch,
tracking, and recovery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Weapons systems</ENAMEX> and space
exploration equipment are defined in the following
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paragraphs</ENAMEX>.


57.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weapons Systems</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Weapons systems</ENAMEX> are a combination of one
or more <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">weapons18</NUMEX> with all related equipment, materials, services,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and means of delivery and deployment required for
self-sufficiency<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX> This standard addresses only the PP&E
component of weapons systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> included in weapons systems
are distinguished from general property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment held
by defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and defense support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in that they are
intended to be used directly by the armed forces to carry out
combat missions, when necessary, and to train in
peacetime.


58.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Weapons systems</ENAMEX> include only those assets owned by
defense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and defense support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that would otherwise
meet the property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment definition. Items meeting
other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> asset category definitions are excluded
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>, such as items of inventory or
operating materials and supplies.


59.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Exploration Equipment</ENAMEX>. Space exploration equipment
includes




•
items that are intended to operate above the atmosphere
for space exploration purposes, and


•
any specially designed equipment to aid, service, or
operate other equipment engaged in exploring space.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEASUREMENT</ENAMEX>


60.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> shall be valued using either the
total cost or the latest acquisition cost valuation
method.


61.
There is a presumption that the valuation method
previously used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> was appropriate for the circumstances
and, therefore, should be applied on a consistent basis.
Accordingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preparer</ENAMEX> shall justify any changes in the use of a
valuation method.


18Weapons are instruments of combat used to destroy, injure,
defeat or threaten an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. (adapted from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Weapons</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military Terms</ENAMEX>)
19Joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense Dictionary of</ENAMEX>
Military and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Terms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Publication</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-02</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 23</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.


62.
For purposes of this standard, the "total cost method" is
defined to include the actual acquisition cost of each item held
plus the costs of any additions, improvements, alterations,
rehabilitations, or replacements that extend the useful life of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX>.


63.
Under the latest acquisition cost method, all like units
that are held are valued at the invoice price of the most recent
like item purchased, less any discounts, plus additional costs
described in the following paragraphs.


64.
Using either cost valuation method, the cost assigned to
an item of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> shall include all costs incurred to bring the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> to a form and location suitable for its
intended use. For example, the cost of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> may include:




•
amounts paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>;


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX> charges to the point of initial
use;


•
handling and storage costs;


•
labor and other direct or indirect production costs (for
assets produced or constructed);


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX>, architectural, and other outside services
for designs, plans, specifications, and surveys;


•
acquisition and preparation costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>;


•
an appropriate share of the cost of the equipment and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> used in construction work;


•
fixed equipment and related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">installation</ENAMEX> costs required
for activities in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>;


•
direct costs of inspection, supervision, and
administration of construction contracts and construction
work;


•
legal and recording fees and damage claims;


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> value of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and equipment donated to the
government; and


•

material amounts of interest costs paid<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX>


<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>. No asset amount shall be shown on the balance sheet for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX>.
20
"Interest costs" include any reimbursable interest paid by the
reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> of goods or services related
to the acquisition or construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX>. It
excludes any interest costs paid by a reporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> in financing
its own debt.


66.
The acquisition cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> shall be
considered an expense in determining the net costs of operations in
the period acquired. The cost of constructing, improving,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reconstructing</ENAMEX>, or renovating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> also shall
be considered an expense in determining net costs in the period
incurred.


67.
For acquisitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> where costs
are incurred over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a number of years</TIMEX>, the portion of the cost
incurred during the reporting period shall be considered an expense
in the period incurred in determining the net cost of operations
and the total cost to date considered an acquisition-in-process
cost in the required supplementary stewardship
information.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MINIMUM REPORTING</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Mission PP&E</ENAMEX> shall be reported as required
supplementary stewardship information. Reporting at the entity
level for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> shall be more specific than at
the governmentwide level. At a minimum, the following information
shall be reported:


•
A description of major types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission PP&E
by the holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and the values assigned under the valuation
method used.


•
The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> added and withdrawn

from revaluations of assets held to latest acquisition cost, and
the end-of-year value for each major type of property using the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s valuation method.


•
A description of the methods of acquisition and
withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX>. This should be reported at
the major program or category level; individual transactions,
unless significant, need not be reported.


•
Condition21 of the assets unless it is already reported
in a note to the financial statements in which case a reference to
the note will suffice.


•
A reference to the applicable note to the financial

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship Land</ENAMEX>
Land not acquired for or in connection with22 items of general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>, that is, stewardship land, shall be reported as required
supplementary stewardship information accompanying the financial
statements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and the separate reports of
component units of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> responsible for such
land. Stewardship land shall be reported in terms of physical units
rather than cost, fair value, or other monetary values.
DEFINITION


71.
"Land" is defined as the solid part of the surface of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX>. Excluded from the definition are the natural resources (that
is, depletable resources, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral deposits</ENAMEX> and petroleum;
renewable resources, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX>; and the outer-continental
shelf resources) related to land.


72.
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> holds vast amounts of
"proven" and "inferred" natural resources, the major reasons for
addressing only surface land in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">project</ENAMEX> were (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the allotted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> frame within which to complete this standard; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) existing
studies that point out the difficulties and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of
accurately estimating and valuing natural resources; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
disputes regarding the boundaries of the outer-continental
shelf<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX>


73.
Land and land rights24 owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>
and acquired for or in connection with items of general PP&E
shall be accounted for and reported as general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX>.


74.
Land and land rights owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> and
not acquired for or in connection with items of general PP&E
will be reported as stewardship land. Examples of stewardship land
include land used as forests and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and land used for wildlife
and grazing.


22
"Acquired for or in connection with" is defined as including
land acquired with the intent to construct general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> and
land acquired in combination with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general PP&E</ENAMEX>, including not
only land used as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>, but also adjacent land considered
to be the general <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>'s common grounds.
23
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> presently has an active project to address standards
for natural resources.
24
"Land rights" are interests and privileges held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> in
land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, water and
water power rights, diversion rights, submersion rights,
rights-of-way, mineral rights, and other like interests in
land.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEASUREMENT</ENAMEX>


75.
Stewardship land shall be quantified in terms of physical
units (for example, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX>) rather than in monetary
terms.


76.
No asset amount shall be shown on the balance sheet of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> financial statements for stewardship land.


77.
The acquisition cost of stewardship land shall be
considered an expense in the period acquired when determining the
net cost of operations.


78.
In some cases, land may be acquired along with existing
structures. The following treatments may apply:




•
if the structure, which would be deemed a heritage asset,
is significant in and of itself, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> shall use its judgement
as to whether the acquisition cost shall be treated as the cost of
stewardship land, heritage asset, or both;


•
if the structure is to be used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> (for
example, as general PP&E) but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the value of the structure is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insignificant</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2</NUMEX>) its acquisition is merely a byproduct of the
acquisition of the land, the cost in its entirety shall be treated
as an acquisition of stewardship land; or


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">•</ENAMEX> only significant structures that have an operating use (such
as, a recently constructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> or employee housing block) shall
be treated as general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> by identifying the cost attributable
to general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> and segregating it from the cost of the
stewardship land acquired.


79.
However, no amounts for stewardship land acquired through
donation or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">devise25</NUMEX> shall be recognized as a cost in calculating
net cost. The fair value of the property, if known and material,
shall be disclosed in notes to the financial statements. If fair
value is not estimable, information related to the type and
quantity of assets received shall be disclosed in the year
received.


80.
Any costs to prepare stewardship land for its intended
use (for example, razing a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>) shall be expensed as a part of
the cost of stewardship land.



<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MINIMUM REPORTING</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX>. Reporting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> level for stewardship land shall be
more specific than at the governmentwide level. Minimum reporting
shall include the following:


•
The number of physical units of stewardship land by
category of major use, broken down within that category by
principal holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>.


•
Where parcels of stewardship land have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> use,
the predominant use of the land shall be considered the major use.
Examples of major uses of stewardship land include <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wildlife</ENAMEX>, grazing, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, recreation, and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. In cases
where land has multiple uses, none of which is predominant, a
description of the multiple uses shall be presented.


•
Acquisitions, withdrawals, and ending balance should be
shown by major categories of use, and methods of acquisition and
withdrawal identified. Reporting should be at the major category
level; individual transactions, unless significant, need not be
reported.


•
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">condition26</NUMEX> of the stewardship land, unless it is
already reported in a note to the financial statement, in which
case a reference to the note will suffice.


•
A reference to the note to the financial statements if
deferred maintenance is reported for the assets.27

a better indication of investment, reporting of the additional

have no historical data, only current reporting year data need be
reported. Reporting shall be at a meaningful category or level, for
example, a major program or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. Reporting of major

APPENDIX A: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX>. This appendix provides a discussion of the more significant
comments that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> received from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> to the exposure
draft, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supplementary Stewardship Reporting</ENAMEX>, dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1995</TIMEX> and
from testimony at a public hearing on the exposure draft that was
held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 5, 1995</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX>. Responses overall were generally favorable to the concept
of reporting stewardship information. In some cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
had questions about the specific reporting requirements or
requested clarification on particular items. Where feasible, these
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> were addressed or clarified in the final standards in this
Statement. In the case of issues raised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appendix</ENAMEX> explains the basis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s conclusions.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATURE OF STEWARDSHIP REPORTING</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX>. The exposure draft presented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s approach to
reporting in a manner other than is done in the basic financial
statements for those items that it has categorized as stewardship
items. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> stated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX> and Background
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX> of this Statement, it believes that these stewardship items
warrant specialized reporting to highlight their importance and to
portray them in additional ways than provided by financial
accounting. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> designated a new category of reporting to
highlight the unique nature of stewardship reporting, Required
Supplemental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship Information</ENAMEX> (RSSI).
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> believed that, although reporting on
stewardship items might be warranted, a separate manner of
reporting might not. They believed that stewardship reporting could
be accommodated either within the basic financial statements, for
example, as a note, or as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Required Supplemental Information</ENAMEX> (RSI).
They did not see the need for the separate category of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSSI</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>, however, believes that a new category for
reporting on stewardship items is more appropriate. If stewardship
information were required to be reported in a note to the basic
financial statements, it would be subject to the same level of
audit scrutiny as that of the basic financial statements. Since
some of the stewardship information is non-financial, for example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, and other data is based on projections or
assumptions, the same degree of audit coverage as that of the basic
financial statements for these items may not be appropriate. Such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> is not drawn directly from the financial records. Thus
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliance</ENAMEX> on financial records for audit backup would not be
feasible.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114</NUMEX>. On the other hand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> believes that certain
stewardship information should receive more audit scrutiny than it
would if it were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSI</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSI</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> reviews the data for
overall compliance with associated guidance and for consonance with
the basic financial statements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> usually provides
in-depth review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSI</ENAMEX> only if there appears to be some problem
with the data. If he or she believes that the data is not fairly
presented, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> still may issue a clean opinion on the basic
financial statements while noting that there are problems with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSI</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>. Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> has proposed that a new category,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSSI</ENAMEX>, be designated to cover stewardship reporting. By developing
this new category, it is anticipated that audit standards will be
developed to address the specific items in that category. Although
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> does not have authority to set audit standards, it
established RSSI with the expectation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> will, in
collaboration, determine appropriate audit procedures for this
information.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOCIAL INSURANCE</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX>. Consideration of guidance for the recognition, measurement
and display of obligations for social insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> has
continued to present the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> with significant, vexing theoretical
and practical problems. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> notes the strength of feelings of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>, some of whom believe a liability
should be recognized for amounts that will be paid in future
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> to or on behalf of current or future program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX>
and others who believe that there is no obligation associated with
these programs that meets the definition of a liability, other than
amounts due and payable at the end of an accounting period;
additionally, some favor disclosure of projected data relating to
the magnitude of the present value of future net benefit payments
at a particular date while others favor cash flow information for a
long period of time. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> notes too the magnitude and
complexity of these programs and the extreme sensitivity of
projections relating to the programs to assumptions whose range of
possibilities is large. More importantly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> notes that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> insurance programs are presently being studied and discussed
frequently and seriously within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and by the public; a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> and recommendations are expected shortly from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-95</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospects</ENAMEX> of
significant changes to the programs are reasonably high.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX>. After deliberating the issue, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> has concluded that
additional investigation and further deliberation is required and
has directed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASAB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to continue to research social
insurance issues focusing especially on: identifying the
characteristics of programs which should cause them to be subject
to the guidance provided in a Statement on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Insurance</ENAMEX>; the
appropriate display of information in the financial statements; the
identification of additional information, if any, which should be
required for social insurance programs; the means for measurement
of financial data included in such additional information; and, the
desirability of nonfinancial indicators (ratios of data to GDP or
"covered payroll") to describe the status of programs or the
implications of potential changes to or needs of the programs.The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> has instructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to be mindful of all current
developments in structuring its research and its
recommendations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EXPENSING STEWARDSHIP PP&E</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX>. Echoing their earlier comments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s Exposure
Draft, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting for Property</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equipment</ENAMEX>, some
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> expressed concern that expensing rather than
capitalizing costs associated with stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> would
lessen the value of the operating statement as a tool for
performance measurement since it would overstate the cost in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> an asset is acquired.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>, however, believes that capitalizing and
depreciating stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> provides information that is of
little usefulness. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship PP&E</ENAMEX> includes heritage assets,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>, and stewardship land. Period costs
related to stewardship PP&E are of diminished usefulness
because of uncertain useful life (e.g., heritage assets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission PP&E</ENAMEX>), uncertain historical cost basis (e.g.,
stewardship land), or probability of being destroyed in use (e.g.,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission PP&E). Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> believes that
attempting to capitalize and depreciate stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> is not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>. It believes that reporting on information related to the
existence and the condition of the stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> has more
relevance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decision-makers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the financial
report.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COSTING OF FEDERAL MISSION PP&E</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s question on whether the
alternatives of presenting costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> in
terms of either total (historical) or latest acquisition cost
generally believed that both options should not be allowed. Some
believed that use of alternative methods would not ensure
consistency in reporting. Others believed that only total
(historical) costs should be used. Still others believed that total
(historical) cost should be the long-term goal, with the use of
latest acquisition cost allowed only until such historical cost
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> would be available.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>, however, recognizes that significant practical
problems may arise if an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> is compelled to adopt a specified
costing approach for reporting stewardship assets, and that such
cost approach would not be used for computing the net cost of
operations. Therefore, it believes that its decision to accept
either the historical cost or latest acquisition cost method is
appropriate. However, it also emphasizes that once a method is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chosen</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> should switch to the other method only with
appropriate justification.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORTING EXPENSE OR OUTLAY DATA</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX>. The standards require that expense data be reported for
investments in human capital, research and development, and
nonfederal physical property. The standards also provide for a
period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years</TIMEX> to transition to reporting expense data for those
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that currently maintain only outlay data. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> suggested that since some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> currently maintain only
outlay data, requiring that only outlay data be reported might be
more practical. However, the responses reflected a clear consensus
for reporting expenses, with little or no support for reporting
outlays only, and a minority preferring to report both expenses and
outlays. Therefore, the standards, as proposed, remain
unchanged.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">REQUEST FOR MORE SPECIFICITY IN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> developed the standards for stewardship
reporting, its intention was to provide overall guidance on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">definitions</ENAMEX>, recognition, measurement, and minimum and recommended
reporting. This broad guidance was intended to provide the basic
reporting requirements while allowing each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> maximum
flexibility in such areas as determining what constitutes the
individual stewardship items for that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, which costs are
directly attributable to the stewardship item, and how best to
report on multi-use items so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> will gain the best picture
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s financial and performance information.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> believes that the desire for more specific
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">guidance</ENAMEX> expressed by several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> stems from the belief
that without such guidance, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s determination of how to
apply the standards could be questioned. Nevertheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>
reiterates its position that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> should be provided maximum
flexibility when applying the stewardship standards. However,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX> should make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of how best to apply the
stewardship standards based on a thorough analysis of their
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, including its mission, financial practices, and
the impact of its mission and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> on financial report users
and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Nation</ENAMEX>. Finally, all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> determinations of the
applicability of stewardship standards should be thoroughly
documented.
ISSUES FOR WHICH CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROPOSED STANDARDS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Multiple Category Reporting</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were
concerned that there would be double counting if, as proposed by
the standards, some stewardship items would be reported in two
separate categories; for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yellowstone National Park</ENAMEX> would
be reported as a heritage asset and as stewardship land.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX>. Reporting supplementary stewardship information in two
categories will not be deemed double counting. This is because
where multiple reporting is required, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of measure are
different for each of the stewardship categories. In the example
above, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yellowstone National Park</ENAMEX> would be reported under a
category, such as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Parks</ENAMEX>," as one of the total number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> assets under the auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX>; it also would be reported by the number of acres that it
occupies under the stewardship land category for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>. To
clarify this point, the discussion of the process of multiple
reporting was expanded in the statement to explain that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>
does not consider this reporting as double counting.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">127</NUMEX>. Reporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair Value for Stewardship PP&E</ENAMEX>
Transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Local Governments</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>
questioned the need for, and the cost/benefit of, requiring that
the fair value of stewardship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> transferred to state and
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> be reported. They stated that monetary values for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stewardship PP&E</ENAMEX> are not required to be reported because such
values are either difficult to obtain (e.g., lack of historical
cost data on land acquired at the birth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>) or not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meaningful</ENAMEX> (e.g., the historical cost to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monument</ENAMEX>). Therefore, they questioned the cost/benefit of requiring
that the fair value of stewardship property transferred to state
and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> be determined and reported.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> agreed that the fair value of stewardship
property transferred to state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> need not be
determined and reported. The standards have been revised to require
a description of the property transfer transaction; if the fair
value is known, nothing would preclude reporting it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EFFECTIVE DATE FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX>. In considering required reporting of stewardship
information, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> became increasingly aware of the need to be
highly selective in proposing requirements for the consolidated
financial report of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>. It recognized the
potential for implementation problems in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few years</TIMEX> after
the effective date of this statement. In addition to the normal
problems associated with adapting to new standards, several of
these standards provide for a transition period during which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> may or, in some cases, may not report investments in human
capital, research and development and nonfederal physical property;
if investments are reported for each of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> as called for in
this statement, they may be reported for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier years</TIMEX> during the
transition period on the basis of either outlays or expense. The
merit of reporting the aggregate of information prepared on
different bases is questionable.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX>. Further, the information required to be reported by these
standards goes beyond that customarily accompanying financial
reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> or commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX>. Standards related
to heritage assets and stewardship land call for reporting in terms
of physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (e.g., number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of land) rather
than in terms of historical cost. Implementation problems are
foreseen at the consolidated statement level because of differing
measures. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> is concerned with the possibility of
establishing requirements so detailed as to render the consolidated
financial report unwieldy, unfriendly to the potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> and
obfuscating of important information.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX>. Because of these possible implementation problems and the
need to consider other disclosures or presentations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>
expressed a desire for further deliberations relative to the
consolidated financial report of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX>. Accordingly, the effective date of this statement will be
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years</TIMEX> beginning after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 30, 1997</TIMEX> as it relates
to financial statements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component units</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government; this same effective date applies to chapter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> as it
relates to the consolidated financial statements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government. The effective date of the statement as it applies to
the consolidated financial statements, except for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 8</ENAMEX>, is
deferred pending further deliberations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>. In the
interim, the consolidated financial reports should include such
summary or selected information as is feasible. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Experimentation</ENAMEX> is
encouraged, as is the reporting of such additional information as
will enhance the financial report.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORTING OF INFORMATION NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED</ENAMEX> IN THE
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STANDARDS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> requested that the standards provide for
reporting additional information, such as transfers of stewardship
property to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, stewardship land sold to the
private sector, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>'s interest in such things as
property held by nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> or patents generated through
Federal research and development funds, and foreign contributions
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> programs.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX>. In developing the standards for stewardship reporting, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> concentrated on providing guidance in the principal areas of
stewardship resources that have materiality for the majority of
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and for the consolidated financial reporting for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Nation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>'s intent was to ensure that these significant
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>, if material for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, would be reported regularly and
in a consistent manner.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX>. In some cases, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> may have other resources or
obligations that were not specifically addressed in the stewardship
standards, but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> believes may be material to the
presentation of its stewardship information. In such cases, if the
reporting of such additional data would be useful and relevant to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, and would provide a better indication of the resources and
obligations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> encourages such reporting.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APPENDIX</ENAMEX> B: SAMPLE REPORTS
NOTE
The sample report sections in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> B are intended to
illustrate the type of reporting contemplated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>. Certain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are taken from various reports for one or more recent years
and are "actual data." Other data have been estimated by
judgmentally extrapolating from "actual data." Still other data and
program references have been fabricated and are hypothetical.
Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> should not rely on the validity of the data in
the sample reports.

provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HERITAGE ASSETS ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> assets are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> that possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the
following characteristics: historical or natural significance;
cultural, educational or aesthetic value; or significant
architectural characteristics. The cost of heritage assets is not
often relevant or determinable. In addition, the useful life of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> assets is generally not reasonably estimable for
depreciation purposes. The most relevant information about heritage
assets is their existence and condition. Therefore, heritage assets
are reported in terms of physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
Various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> operate and maintain heritage assets. During
the period, maintenance expense is recognized as incurred. However,
certain maintenance was deferred over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>. Below
is information on deferred maintenance on stewardship assets.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEDERAL MISSION PROPERTY</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission property, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and equipment (PP&E)
comprise certain PP&E that possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of each of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of the following characteristics relating to the use of
the property and its useful life. Characteristics related to use
are that it: has no expected nongovernmental alternative use; is
held for use in the event of an emergency, a war, or a natural
disaster; or, is used in a program for which there is no other
comparable program (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> or nonfederal) using similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PP&E</ENAMEX>.
Characteristics related to useful life are that it: has an
indeterminate or an unpredictable useful life because of the
unusual manner in which it is used, improved, retired, modified, or
maintained or is at a very high risk of being destroyed during use
or of premature obsolescence. Generally accepted government
accounting standards specifically recognize weapons systems and
space exploration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and equipment as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>.
At this time, only weapons systems and space exploration
equipment have been identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> for this
entity.
In the display that follows, items included under the caption
"weapons systems" are valued at the most recent acquisition cost of
a comparable item. Those under the caption "space exploration" are
valued using the specific identification method, that is, the
specific cost of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> is attributed to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
In each category, cost includes all costs to put the item in usable
condition for its intended purpose including, among others,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX>, assembly, and inspection costs.
The value of land associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> included among
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> is not included in the display that
follows. Land data are included in a separate section of this
information entitled "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stewardship Land</ENAMEX>."
Virtually all items of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">PP&E</ENAMEX> are useable for
their intended purposes at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 30, 199Z</TIMEX>. In some cases,
however, scheduled maintenance has been deferred. On the basis of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX> estimates, the estimated cost of deferred maintenance
ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 to $ 300 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">199Z</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175 to $275 million</NUMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">199Y</TIMEX>. Costs to complete critical maintenance, that is,
maintenance that, if not performed, could lead to irreparable

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEWARDSHIP LAND ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION</ENAMEX>
"Land" is defined as the solid part of the surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>.
Excluded from the definition of land for reporting purposes here
are materials beneath the surface (that is, depletable resources
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral deposits</ENAMEX> and petroleum), the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> above the
surface (that is, renewable resources such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX>), and the
outer-continental shelf resources. These materials will be
addressed in a future standard.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> holds <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 650 million acres</NUMEX> of
land. Land that is acquired for or in connection with items of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general PP&E</ENAMEX> are reported on the balance sheet. Land that is
not acquired for or in connection with items of general PP&E is
considered stewardship land. Of the total amount of land held by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 617 million acres</NUMEX> are considered
stewardship land.
The cost or value of stewardship land is often not determinable.
The most relevant information about stewardship land is its
existence, condition, and use. Therefore, stewardship land is
reported in terms of physical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> rather than cost, fair value,
or other monetary values.
The major uses of stewardship land are for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, wildlife,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grazing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, recreation, and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. Where parcels of
stewardship land have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> use, the predominant use of the
land is considered the major use. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are
responsible for maintaining virtually all stewardship land held by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments of the Interior</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>.
Virtually all stewardship land is useable for its purposes at
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 30, 1994</TIMEX>. In some cases, however, scheduled maintenance
has been deferred. Estimates of costs to complete critical
maintenance range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 40 to $ 50 million</NUMEX>. "Critical maintenance"
refers to maintenance that, if not performed, could lead to
irreparable damage to the assets or to unusability. On the basis of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engineering</ENAMEX> estimates, the estimated cost of deferred maintenance
ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 to $ 100 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">199Z</TIMEX>.
On the following page is a summary of the stewardship land by
category of major use, broken down within each category by
principal holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 30, 199Z</TIMEX>.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>, 199Z
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annually</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> provides funding to state and
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> for the purchase, the construction, or the major
renovation of physical property owned by state and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>; additionally, from time to time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Government transfers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX> to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> in exchange for
less than fair value. These grants and transfers relate to roads
and transportation systems, clean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and environmental projects,
and other projects for the common good.
The investments in nonfederal physical property in the 5 years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 199V</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">199Z</NUMEX> were as follows: (in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX>)

facilities associated with former military installations that were
transferred to local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> approximated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40 million</NUMEX> in 199Y
and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$52 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">199Z</TIMEX>.
Certain transportation and environmental programs involving
Federal investments of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$22 billion and $4 billion</NUMEX>, respectively, in
199Z required matching support by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUMAN CAPITAL ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION</ENAMEX>
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Fiscal Year Ended September 30</TIMEX>, 199Z
Federal investment in human capital comprises those expenses for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and training programs for the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> that are
intended to increase or maintain national economic productive
capacity. It does not include expenses for internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>

Program Outcomes
Preliminary data appear to confirm that the services provided by
the program accelerate the transition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> into
alternative employment; some savings are realized in the
Unemployment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurance Fund</ENAMEX>. A follow-up survey of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">415</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 199W</TIMEX> showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> were earning at least
as much as they were earning in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contractor positions</ENAMEX>. A
more extensive evaluation, including an assessment of effects on
long-term earnings, is currently planned for completion in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Narrative Discussion</ENAMEX>
This program was authorized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19XX</TIMEX> (by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.L. XX</ENAMEX>-XXX) to ease the
transition into other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian positions</ENAMEX> of skilled technical,
administrative, and managerial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> who are no longer needed
in certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shipyards</ENAMEX> because of declining orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>
construction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eligibility</ENAMEX> is limited to those who have been employed at
designated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shipyards</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 5 years</TIMEX>, but who are not yet
eligible for retirement benefits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> receive intensive
counseling to help them develop individual transition plans. This
counseling is provided by a private job placement service under
contract. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> are then reimbursed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to $5,000</NUMEX> per year
for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 2 years</TIMEX>, not to exceed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of the cost of the cost
of tuition, fees, books, and other student materials required for
attendance at approved educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
An additional increment of education or technical training is
expected to reduce the period of transitional unemployment and
increase <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the subsequent</TIMEX> earnings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION</ENAMEX> For the

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>, 199Z
Federal investment in research and development comprises those
expenses for basic research, applied research, and development that
are intended to increase or maintain national economic productive
capacity or yield other benefits. Expense data are expressed in
nominal dollars for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year</TIMEX> being reported upon and the

The increasing number of articles published on the basis of
funded research, including announcements of several newly
discovered properties of certain composite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, is evidence of
the utility of this part of the program. The number of patents
emerging from the program is also increasing, primarily from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> component of the program.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Narrative Discussion</ENAMEX>:
This program was authorized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19XX</TIMEX> (by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.L. XX</ENAMEX>-XXX) to
accelerate the development of this industry in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
The research element of the program operates through interagency
agreements with the Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> and grants to university
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are selected through peer review
procedures. The development <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">component</ENAMEX> provides grants to private
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> to develop improved manufacturing procedures for ceramic
materials-based products and to accelerate the development of
marketable products incorporating advanced ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CURRENT SERVICES ASSESSMENT ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION</ENAMEX>
A Current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Assessment</ENAMEX> (CSA) provides receipt and outlay
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> on the basis of projections of future activities. It is
relevant for assessing the sustainability of programs established
by current law. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSA</ENAMEX> focuses on the totality of government
operations rather than on individual programs. It provides an
analytical perspective on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> because it shows the
short- and long-term directions of current programs.
The following display presents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSA</ENAMEX> data for all programs for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years subsequent</TIMEX> to the base year. The data are identical to
projected data prepared for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> for the same

questionnaires, observation, and review of physical records of
work. It is the foundation for agency process value analysis, which
is key to overall review of program delivery.
ACTIVITY-BASED <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COSTING</ENAMEX> - A cost accounting method that measures
the cost and performance of process related activities and cost
objects. It assigns cost to cost objects, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, based on their use of activities. It recognizes the
causal relationship of cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> to activities.
ACTUAL COST - An amount determined on the basis of cost incurred
including standard cost properly adjusted for applicable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>.

for establishing the amount and the incidence of employer
contributions or accounting charges for pension costs under a
pension plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACTUARIAL LIABILITY - A</ENAMEX> liability based on statistical
calculations and actuarial assumptions (actuarial assumptions are
conditions used to resolve uncertainties in the absence of

limits the obligations that may be incurred. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB Circular</ENAMEX>
A-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APPROPRIATION</ENAMEX> -In most cases, appropriations are a form of
budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> provided by law that permits federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to
incur obligations and make payments out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> for
specified purposes. An appropriation usually follows enactment of
authorizing legislation. An appropriation act is the most common
means of providing budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, but in some cases the
authorizing legislation itself provides the budget authority.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASSESSMENTS - Enforceable</ENAMEX> claims for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nonexchange</TIMEX> revenue for
which specific amounts due have been determined and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> from
whom the tax or duty is due has been identified. They include both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">selfassessments</ENAMEX> made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> filing tax returns and assessments
made by the collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> as a result of audits,
investigations, and litigation. Although the term is normally used
in connection with taxes, as used in this Statement assessments
also include determinations of amounts due for any other kind of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonexchange</ENAMEX> revenue. Specifically excluded from the definition of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assessments</ENAMEX>, as used in this Statement, are compliance assessments.
Compliance assessments, as defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>, do not
represent financial receivables.
ASSETS -Tangible or intangible items owned by the federal
government which would have probable economic benefits that can be
obtained or controlled by a federal government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. (Adapted

AVOIDABLE COST -A cost associated with an activity that would
not be incurred if the activity were not performed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</ENAMEX> - As used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SFFAS 7</ENAMEX>, the basic
financial statements are those on which an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> would normally
be engaged to express an opinion. The term "basic" does not
necessarily mean that other financial information not covered by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s opinion is less important to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> than that
contained in the basic statements; it merely connotes the expected
nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s review of, and association with, the
information. The basic financial statements in financial reports
prepared pursuant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> Act, as amended,
are called the "principal financial statements." The Form and
Content of these statements are determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BASIC RESEARCH - Systematic</ENAMEX> study to gain knowledge or
understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of
observable facts without specific applications toward processes or

BOOK VALUE - The net amount at which an asset or liability is
carried on the books of account (also referred to as carrying value
or amount). It equals the gross or nominal amount of any asset or
liability minus any allowance or valuation amount.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUDGET AUTHORITY</ENAMEX> - The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> law to
incur financial obligations that will result in immediate or future
outlays. Specific forms of budget <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> include:


•
appropriations, which may be provided in appropriations
acts or other laws and which permit obligations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tobe</ENAMEX> incurred and
payments to be made;


•
borrowing authority, which permits obligations to be
incurred but requires funds to be borrowed to liquidatethe
obligation;


•
contract authority, which permits obligations to be
incurred but requires a subsequent appropriation oroffsetting
collections to liquidate the obligations; and


•
spending authority from offsetting collections, which
permits offsetting collections to be credited to anexpenditure
account and permits obligations and payments to be made using the
offsetting collections (the offsetting collections credited to an
account are deducted from gross budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> of the
account.)


Budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> may be classified by period of availability
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX>, multiple-year, or no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>), by nature of the authority
(current or permanent), by the manner of determining the amount
available (definite or indefinite), or as gross (without reduction
of offsetting collections) and net (with reductions of offsetting
collections). (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-11</ENAMEX>, Preparation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Submission</ENAMEX> of

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING - Budgetary</ENAMEX> accounting is the system that
measures and controls the use of resources according to the
purposes for which budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> was enacted; and that records
receipts and other collections by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. It tracks the use of each
appropriation for specified purposes in separate budget accounts
through the various stages of budget execution from appropriation
to apportionment and allotment to obligation and eventual outlay.
This system is used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Branch</ENAMEX> to set
priorities, to allocate resources among alternative uses, to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> these resources, and to assess the economic implications of
federal financial activity at an aggregate level. Budgetary
accounting is used to comply with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Constitutional</ENAMEX> requirement
that "No Money shall be drawn from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, but in Consequence
of Appropriations Made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account
of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be
published from time to time." (See Statement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">186-191</ENAMEX>.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUDGETARY RESOURCES</ENAMEX> - The forms of authority given to an agency
allowing it to incur obligations. Budgetary resources include the
following: new budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, unobligated balances, direct
spending authority, and obligation limitations. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> Budget
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glossary</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BUSINESS TYPE ACTIVITY - Significantly</ENAMEX> self-sustaining activity
which finances its continuing cycle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> through
collection of exchange revenue.
CAPITAL LEASES - Leases that transfer substantially all the
benefits and risks of ownership to the lessee.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPITALIZE</ENAMEX> - To record and carry forward into one or more future
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods any</TIMEX> expenditure the benefits or process from which will
then be realized. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kohler's Dictionary</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountants</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CLEANUP COSTS - The</ENAMEX> costs of removing, containing, and/or
disposing of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) hazardous waste from property, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) material
and/or property that consists of hazardous waste at permanent or
temporary closure or shutdown of associated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP&E</ENAMEX>.
COHORT -Those direct loans obligated or loan guarantees
committed by a program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> even if disbursements occur
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subsequent years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Post-1991</ENAMEX> direct loans or loan guarantees will
remain with their original cohort throughout the life of the loan,
even if the loan is modified. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pre-1992</ENAMEX> loans and loan guarantees
that are modified shall each, respectively, constitute a single
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-11</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COLLATERAL -Real</ENAMEX> or personal property pledged as part or full
security on a debt. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kohler's Dictionary</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountants</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COLLECTIONS - Amounts</ENAMEX> received by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> during
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>. Collections are classified as follows:-- Budget
receipts or off-budget receipts are collections from the public
based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s exercise of its sovereign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX>,
including collections from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in compulsory social
insurance programs. -- Offsetting collections are collections from
government accounts (intragovernmental transactions) or from the
public that are offset against budget authority and outlays rather
than reflected as receipts in computing the budget and off-budget
totals. They are classified as (a) offsetting receipts (i.e.,
amounts deposited to receipt accounts), and (b) collections
credited to appropriation or fund accounts. The distinction between
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major categories is that collections credited to
appropriation or fund accounts are offset within the account that
contains the associated disbursements (outlays), whereas offsetting
receipts are in accounts separate from the associated
disbursements. Offsetting collections are deducted from gross
disbursements in calculating net outlays. (Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Glossary Of</ENAMEX>
Terms Used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Federal Budget Process</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Related Accounting</ENAMEX>,
Economic, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tax Terms, Third Edition</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1981</TIMEX>.)
COMMON COST - The cost of resources employed jointly in the
production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more outputs and the cost cannot be directly
traced to any one of those outputs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMMON DATA SOURCE</ENAMEX> - All of the financial and programmatic
information available for the budgetary, cost, and financial
accounting processes. It includes all financial and much
non-financial data, such as environmental data, that are necessary
for budgeting and financial reporting as well as evaluation and
decision information developed as a result of prior reporting and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feedback</ENAMEX>.
CONDITION -The physical state of an asset. The condition of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX> is based on an evaluation of the physical status/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">asset</ENAMEX>, its ability to perform as planned, and its continued
usefulness. Evaluating an asset's condition requires knowledge of
the asset, its performance capacity and its actual ability to
perform, and expectations for its continued performance. The
condition of a long-lived asset is affected by its durability, the
quality of its design and construction, its use, the adequacy of
maintenance that has been performed, and many other factors,
including: accidents (an unforeseen and unplanned or unexpected
event or circumstance), catastrophes (a tragic event), disasters (a
sudden calamitous event bringing great damage, loss, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">destruction</ENAMEX>), and obsolescence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CONDITION ASSESSMENT SURVEYS</ENAMEX> - Periodic inspections of PP&E
to determine their current condition and estimated cost to correct
any deficiencies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONSTANT DOLLAR -A</ENAMEX> dollar value adjusted for changes in the
average price level. A constant dollar is derived by dividing a
current dollar amount by a price index. The resulting constant
dollar value is that which would exist if prices had remained at
the same average level as in the base period. Any changes in such
constant dollar values would therefore reflect only changes in the
real volume of goods and services, not changes in the price level.
Constant dollar figures are commonly used to compute the real value
of the gross domestic product and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> and to estimate
the real level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> receipts and outlays. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> Budget
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glossary</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CONSUMPTION METHOD - A</ENAMEX> method of accounting for goods, such as
materials and supplies, where the goods are recognized as assets
upon acquisition and are expensed as they are consumed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONTINGENCY</ENAMEX> - An existing condition, situation, or set of
circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future
events occur or fail to occur. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONTRA</ENAMEX> ACCOUNT - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more
accounts which partially or wholly offset another or other
accounts; on financial statements, they may be either merged or
appear together. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kohler's Dictionary</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountants</ENAMEX>) CONTRACT
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUTHORITY - Contract</ENAMEX> authority is a subset of budget authority.
(See budget authority.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONTROLLABLE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COST - A</ENAMEX> cost that can be influenced by the action
of the responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>. The term always refers to a specified
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> since all costs are controllable by someone.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COST - Defined</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAC No. 1</ENAMEX>, Objectives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial</ENAMEX>
Reporting as the monetary value of resources used (para. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">195</NUMEX>).
Defined more specifically in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFFAS No. 4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Managerial Cost</ENAMEX>
Accounting Concepts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards for the Federal Government</ENAMEX>, as
the monetary value of resources used or sacrificed or liabilities
incurred to achieve an objective, such as to acquire or produce a
good or to perform an activity or service (page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX>). Depending on
the nature of the transaction, cost may be charged to operations
immediately, i.e., recognized as an expense of the period, or to an
asset account for recognition as an expense of subsequent periods.
In most contexts within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accounting for Revenue</ENAMEX> and Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sources</ENAMEX>, "cost" is used synonymously with expense. See also "Full
Cost."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COST ALLOCATION - A</ENAMEX> method of assigning costs to activities,
outputs, or other cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. The allocation base used to assign
a cost to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> is not necessarily the cause of the cost. For
example, assigning the cost of power to machine activities by
machine <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> is an allocation because machine <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> are an
indirect measure of power consumption.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">COST ASSIGNMENT - A</ENAMEX> process that identifies costs with
activities, outputs, or other cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. In a broad sense, costs
can be assigned to processes, activities, organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>,
products, and services. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> methods of cost assignment:
(a) directly tracing costs wherever economically feasible, (b)
cause-and-effect, and (c) allocating costs on a reasonable and
consistent basis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS</ENAMEX> -The weighing of benefits against costs
usually expressed as a ratio of dollar benefits to dollar costs for
each of a variety of alternatives to provide a comparable basis of
choice among them. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kohler's Dictionary</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountants</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COST DRIVER</ENAMEX> - Any factor that causes a change in the cost of an
activity or output. For example, the quality of parts received by
an activity, or the degree of complexity of tax returns to be
reviewed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>.
COST FINDING - Cost finding techniques produce cost data by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> or sampling methods. Cost finding techniques are
appropriate for certain kinds of costs, such as indirect costs,
items with costs below set thresholds within programs, or for some
programs in their entirety. Cost finding techniques support the
overall managerial cost accounting process and can represent
non-recurring analysis of specific costs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COST OBJECT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ALSO REFERRED TO AS COST OBJECTIVE</ENAMEX>) - An activity,
output, or item whose cost is to be measured. In a broad sense, a
cost object can be an organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, a function, task,
product, service, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CREDIT</ENAMEX> PROGRAM -For the purpose of this Statement, a federal
program that makes loans and/or loan guarantees to nonfederal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">borrowers</ENAMEX>.
CURRENT DISCOUNT RATE - With respect to the modification of
direct loans or loan guarantees, it is the discount rate used to
measure the cost of a modification. It is the interest rate
applicable at the time of modification on marketable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
securities with a similar maturity to the remaining maturity of the
direct or guaranteed loans, under either pre-modification terms, or
post-modification terms, whichever is appropriate.
[Special Term from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SFFAS 2</ENAMEX>]
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CURRENT LIABILITIES -Amounts</ENAMEX> owed by a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> for which

within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fiscal year</TIMEX> following the reporting date.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CURRENT SERVICES ASSESSMENT -Projections</ENAMEX> of future receipts and
outlays from future activities based on the programs established by
current law. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSA</ENAMEX> focuses on the totality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
operations rather than on individual programs, and shows the short-
and long-term direction of current programs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CUSTODIAL AGENCY</ENAMEX> - An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> which takes possession of seized
and/or forfeited property.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEDICATED COLLECTIONS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OR TAXES</ENAMEX>) - See "earmarked taxes."
DEFAULT - The failure to meet any obligation or term of a credit

that is specifically identified with a single cost object.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIRECT LOAN -A</ENAMEX> disbursement of funds by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to a
nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">borrower</ENAMEX> under a contract that requires the repayment of
such funds within a certain time with or without interest. The term
includes the purchase of, or participation in, a loan made by
another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lender</ENAMEX>. (Adapted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-11</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIRECTED FLOWS OF RESOURCES -Expenses</ENAMEX> to nonfederal entities
imposed by federal laws or regulations without providing federal
financing. In the case of state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, directed
flows are known as "unfunded mandates." The costs and financing of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX> regulations do not flow through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>, but their
effects are similar to direct federal expenditures and revenue.

Government. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFMIP Standardization Project</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DRAWBACKS - Refunds</ENAMEX> of all or part of duties on imported goods
that are subsequently exported or destroyed. Typically these arise

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ENTRY AGE NORMAL ACTUARIAL METHOD - A</ENAMEX> method under which the
actuarial present value of projected benefits of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> is
allocated on a level basis over the earnings or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> between entry age and assumed exit age. The portion of
this actuarial present value allocated to a valuation year is
called the normal cost. The portion of this present value not
provided for at a valuation date by the present value of future
normal cost is called the actuarial accrued liability. The
assumption is made under this method that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> entered
the plan (entry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>) at the time of initial employment or at the
earliest eligibility date, if the plan had been in existence, and
that contributions have been made from the entry age to the date of
the actuarial valuation. The term "aggregate entry age normal"
refers to an approach whereby costs are determined for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX> rather than for each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> separately.

interest of the investment (referred to as "effective yield" in
some literature). The effective interest is compared with the
stated interest of the investment. (The stated interest is the
interest that is payable to the investor according to the stated
interest rate.) The difference between the effective interest and

amortization amount of the subsidy cost allowance equals the
effective interest minus the nominal interest of the direct loans
times the effective interest rate (the discount rate). The nominal
interest equals the nominal amount (face amount) of the direct
loans times the stated interest rate (the rate stated in the loan
agreements). [Special Term from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SFFAS 2</ENAMEX>]
