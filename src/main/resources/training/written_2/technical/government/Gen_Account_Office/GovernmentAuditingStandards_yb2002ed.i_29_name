<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STANDARDS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> invites your comments on the accompanying proposed changes
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards</ENAMEX> (GAGAS), commonly known as the
"yellow book." These changes propose revision throughout the entire
set of standards except for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> general standard,
independence, which is being revised separately. The proposed
revisions fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> framework, consistent
application of the standards where applicable to the various types
of audits, and strengthening or streamlining the standards. This
letter describes the process followed in revising the standards,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">summarizes</ENAMEX> proposed major changes, outlines the format of this
exposure draft, and requests comments from interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> on
these proposed revisions.
To help ensure that the standards continue to meet the needs of
the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and the public it serves, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller</ENAMEX>
General of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> appointed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advisory Council on</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards</ENAMEX> to review the standards and recommend
necessary changes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advisory Council</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in
financial and performance auditing drawn from all levels of
government, private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX>, public accounting, and academia.
Public comment is requested on all draft revisions to the
standards. This exposure draft reflects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advisory Council</ENAMEX>'s
advice to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX>.
To assist you in developing your comments, this letter discusses
the proposed GAGAS framework and encloses a listing of the proposed
changes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> made for consistent application of the standards
or for strengthening or streamlining the standards.
The types of audits and services and applicable standards are
organized by separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> for financial audits, attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX>, and performance audits in order to make the standards
user friendly. For example, the financial audit and attestation
chapters are directed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> with a financial audit background
and the required knowledge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Institute of Certified</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Accountants</ENAMEX>' (AICPA) Generally Accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auditing Standards</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAAS</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attestation Standards</ENAMEX>. The performance audit chapters
are written to avoid use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminology</ENAMEX> drawn from financial
audits.
The financial audit presentation proposes retaining the current
format of separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> for field and reporting standards. The
term financial audit is defined to include financial statement
audits
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
and other services covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAAS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s Statements on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auditing Standards</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX>), which interpret the standards. These
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> are defined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX> and include areas such as
special reports, reviews of interim financial information, letters
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> and certain other requesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, compliance
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">auditing</ENAMEX>, and audits of service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
Attestation engagements are defined as those services performed
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attestation Standards</ENAMEX> and the related Statement
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attestation Engagements</ENAMEX> (SSAEs), which interpret
the standards. As the proposed additional GAGAS standards are fewer
than for financial audits, the field and reporting standards are
presented in a single chapter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> proposes recognizing the overlap between attestation
engagement objectives and performance audit objectives and allowing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> that overlap to be performed under either set of
standards. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> simply proposes to recognize the
reality of current practice. Namely, performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> provide
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> using performance audit standards, and financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are likely to provide these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> using the attestation
standards. We are not aware of any problems that have arisen as a
result of this practice.
The presentation of the financial audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> proposes
eliminating the term "financial related audits" by specifically
recognizing the services in addition to financial statement audits
that are covered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Statements on Auditing Standards in</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chapters 4</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> or by the Statement on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> for Attestation
Engagements in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 6</ENAMEX>. The term "financial related audits" was
the source of considerable confusion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. By
specifically recognizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> covered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAEs</ENAMEX>, we have proposed clarifying what in fact was intended by
this term, but not always understood by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.
The proposed changes related to performance audits retain the
current presentation of separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> for field and reporting
standards. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advisory Council</ENAMEX> has recognized that GAGAS
applicable to the performance audit objectives of effectiveness,
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> and efficiency, internal control, and compliance are also
applicable to prospective analyses, guidance, or summary
information. Therefore, we have proposed including that latter
objective in the definition of performance audits, as discussed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>, and in the presentation of field work and reporting
standards, in chapters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 8</NUMEX>, applicable to the various
objectives of performance audits. We believe this is a more logical
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> friendly presentation than having a separate chapter
discussing the field work and reporting standards for these
objectives that would only tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> to follow the same
standards applicable to other types of performance audit
objectives.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX> of this exposure draft discusses nonaudit services
provided by audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that are not covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.
These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> generally differ from financial audits, attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX>, and performance audits in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
provide information or data to a requesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> without providing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verification</ENAMEX>, analysis, or evaluation of the information or data,
and therefore the work does not usually provide a basis for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conclusions</ENAMEX>, recommendations, or opinions on the information or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) perform tasks requested by management that directly
support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s operations, such as asset evaluation,
actuarial services, or information system design services. Audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> are encouraged to establish policies for maintaining
the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
quality of this type of work. This exposure draft does not
discuss the impact of the provision of nonaudit services on auditor
independence. That issue was addressed in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX> exposure
draft and comments are currently being considered.
As previously stated, we are enclosing a numbered listing of the
more significant proposed changes made to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> for
consistent application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> and the proposed changes made to
strengthen or streamline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. The enclosure includes a reference
to the applicable proposed revised paragraph(s) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enclosure</ENAMEX> does not include the proposed reorganization of the order
of presentation to provide a more logical grouping of the standards
by function, such as planning, audit documentation, report content,
and the audit process. This proposed type of change was primarily
made to the presentation of the performance audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>.
Given the extensiveness of the proposed revisions, we plan to
issue a new version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> that will incorporate existing
amendments. We expect this revision of the standards to supersede
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> revision, including amendments <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX>. Thereafter, we
intend to continue our policy of issuing amendments addressing
specific issues as needed. We anticipate this revision of the
standards, when finalized, will become effective for financial
audits of periods ending on or after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2003</TIMEX>, and for
attestation engagements and performance audits beginning on or
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2003</TIMEX>.
This draft is being sent to financial management and audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at all levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the public accounting
profession, academia, professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and public
interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. We encourage you to send your comments, whether
you wish to comment on the entire document or only a portion of it.
It would be helpful to key your comments to the specific paragraph
numbers, give your rationale for any proposed changes, and suggest
revised language.

PURPOSE


1.1
The standards and guidance contained in this document,
often referred to as generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS), are intended for use by government <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">auditors1</TIMEX> to
ensure that they maintain integrity, objectivity, and independence

followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> when required by law,
regulation, contract, agreement, or policy. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> The work performed in
accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is referred to as audits and attestation
engagements. This work, which is described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> and more
fully in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>, includes financial audits, attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX>, and performance audits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> of government audits and
attestation engagements that are performed in accordance with GAGAS

The standards and guidance in this document are for
audits and attestation engagements of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>,
programs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX> activities, and services, and of government assistance
administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>, nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, and other
nongovernment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adherence</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> can help ensure that

1This document addresses the standards that should be used by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> conducting the broad array of work that is
described more fully in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, the focus of this
document is not on the wide variety of titles that are used by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> conducting and reporting on this work, but instead the
nature of the work that is being performed. The term "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>"
throughout this document includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who may be titled
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">auditor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>, evaluator, or a similar position description.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Requirements</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> are identified by statements that
include the word "should." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are expected to comply with
these requirements if they apply to the type of work being
performed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are strongly encouraged to comply with the
guidance provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.
3Henceforth, the term "program" will be used in this document to
include government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, services, and activities.

perform their work in this manner and comply with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> in
reporting the results, their work can lead to improved government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, decision-making, and oversight, and can assist in
fulfilling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s duty to be accountable to the public.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> pertain to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' professional qualifications and the
quality of their work, the performance of field work, and the
characteristics of meaningful audit reporting.
1.3 This <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX> describes the applications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
and audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> also describes the concept of
accountability for public resources and discusses the
responsibilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of government programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, and
audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in the audit process.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APPLICABILITY</ENAMEX>


1.4
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> are intended to be followed in performing audits
and attestation engagements. A number of statutes and other
mandates require that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. Where a statute or
other mandate does not exist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> will find it useful to use
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> in work regarding the use of government funds. If auditors
hold themselves out as following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, regardless of whether they
are required to follow such standards, they need to justify any
departures from them.


1.5
The following laws, regulations, or guidelines require
use of GAGAS:




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Inspector General Act of 1978</ENAMEX>, as amended, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">App</ENAMEX>. (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>) requires that the statutorily-appointed federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors general</ENAMEX> comply with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> for audits of federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>, programs, activities, and functions. The act further
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors general</ENAMEX> should take appropriate steps to
ensure that any work performed by nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> complies with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> Act of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Law</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">101-576</ENAMEX>), as expanded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Management Reform Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Law</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">103-356</ENAMEX>), requires that GAGAS be followed in
audits of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' financial
statements.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Law</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">104-156</ENAMEX>) require that GAGAS be followed in audits of state and
local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that receive federal
financial assistance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-133</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Audits</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Local</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Governments</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Non-profit Organizations</ENAMEX>," which provides the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">governmentwide</ENAMEX> guidelines and policies on performing audits to
comply with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Single Audit Act</ENAMEX>, also requires the use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.




1.6
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> need to be alert to other laws, regulations, or
other authoritative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that could require the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.
For example, state and local laws and regulations may require
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> at the state and local levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to follow
these standards. Also, the terms of an agreement or contract may
require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to comply with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> audit guidelines
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertaining</ENAMEX> to program requirements, such as those issued for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing and Urban Development and Student Financial Aid</ENAMEX> programs,
may require that GAGAS be followed.


1.7
Even if not required to do so, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> would find it
useful to follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> in performing audits of federal, state, and
local government programs as well as in performing audits of
government assistance administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>, nonprofit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>, and other nongovernment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. Many audit
organizations not formally required to do so, both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> and in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, voluntarily follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.


1.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may provide professional services, other than
audits and attestation engagements, that consist solely of
gathering, providing, and explaining information requested by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decision-makers</ENAMEX> or by providing advice or assistance to management
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> are not applicable to these other professional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, which are described more fully in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>. However,
providing other professional services may


affect an audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s independence to conduct audits,
which is discussed in chapter 3.
Relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> and Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Standards</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> may be used in conjunction with professional standards
issued by other authoritative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Certified Public Accountants</ENAMEX> (AICPA) has issued
professional standards that apply in financial audits and
attestation engagements. GAGAS incorporate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s field work
and reporting standards and the related statements on the standards
for financial audits unless specifically excluded, as discussed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chapters 4</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. GAGAS incorporates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s general standard
on criteria, and the field work and reporting standards and the
related statements on the standards for attestation engagements,
unless specifically excluded, as discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 6</ENAMEX>. To meet
the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of government audits and attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> also prescribe additional requirements to those
provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> for these types of work.
1.10 Other professional standards which may be used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
are issued by such bodies as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Internal Auditors</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Codification of the Standards for the Professional Practice of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Auditing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Institute of Internal Auditors, Inc.</ENAMEX>), and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Evaluation Association</ENAMEX>, which has developed guiding
principles for evaluators (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guiding Principles for Evaluators</ENAMEX>, a
report from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Evaluation Association Task Force on</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guiding Principles for Evaluators</ENAMEX>). These other professional
standards are not incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, but can be used in
conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.
ACCOUNTABILITY
1.11 The concept of accountability for public resources is
inherent in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s governing processes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Legislators</ENAMEX> and other
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> want to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
know whether (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) government resources are managed properly and
used in compliance with laws and regulations, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) government
programs are achieving their objectives and desired outcomes, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) government programs are being provided efficiently,
economically, and effectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> of these programs are often
asked to render an account of their activities and related results
to legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and the public.


1.12
Financial audits contribute to making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> more
accountable for the use of public resources. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>, in
providing an independent report on whether an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s financial
information is presented fairly in accordance with recognized
criteria, informs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> whether they can rely on the information.
Financial audits performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> also provide
information about internal control and compliance with laws and
regulations as they relate to financial transactions, systems, and
processes.


1.13
Attestation engagements also contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>'
accountability for the use of public resources and the delivery of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an attestation</TIMEX> engagement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> issue an
examination, a review, or an agreed-upon procedures report on the
subject matter or on an assertion about the subject matter, based
on or in conformity with criteria, that is the responsibility of
another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. Attestation engagements can cover a broad range of
financial or nonfinancial objectives and provide various levels of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> about the subject matter or assertion dependent upon the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s needs.


1.14
Performance audits also contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>'
accountability for the use of public resources and for the delivery
of services. The term performance audit is used to include a
variety of objectives to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' needs. Performance audits
provide an independent assessment of the performance and management
of government programs against objective criteria or an assessment
of best practices and other information. Performance audits provide
information to improve program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and facilitate
decision-making by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> with responsibility to oversee or
initiate corrective action, and improve public accountability. The
term performance audit is used generically to include work
classified by some audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> as program evaluations,
program


effectiveness and results audits, economy and efficiency audits,
operational audits, and value-for-money audits.
1.15 Given the importance and complexity of government programs
in providing a variety of public services, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are
increasingly being called on by legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to expand the variety of performance audits to include
work that has a prospective focus or provides guidance, best
practice information, or information on issues that affect multiple
programs or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> already studied or under study by an audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. This work may also include an assessment of policy
alternatives, identification of risks and risk mitigation efforts,
and a variety of analytical services to aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in
performing their responsibilities and stewardship of government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Such work, like other performance audits, involves a
level of analysis, research, or evaluation; may provide conclusions
and recommendations; and results in a report.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1.16 Management</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> of government programs fulfill
essential roles and responsibilities in ensuring that public
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> are used efficiently, economically, effectively, and
legally. Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also have the important responsibility
for ensuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> can meet their responsibilities. These
unique roles involve sound management practices and professional
audits and attestation engagements.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX>'s Role
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1.17 Management</ENAMEX> entrusted with handling public resources (for
example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of a state or local governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> or a
nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that receives federal assistance) is responsible
for applying those resources efficiently, economically,
effectively, and legally to achieve the purposes for which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> were furnished or the program was established. This
responsibility applies to all resources, both financial and
physical, whether entrusted to public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> or others by their
own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituencies</ENAMEX> or by other levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.


1.18
Management entrusted with public resources is responsible
for complying with applicable laws and regulations. That
responsibility encompasses identifying the requirements with which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> must comply and implementing systems
designed to achieve that compliance.


1.19
Management entrusted with public resources is responsible
for establishing and maintaining effective internal control to
ensure that appropriate goals and objectives are met; resources are
received, used efficiently and effectively, and safeguarded; laws
and regulations are followed; and reliable data are obtained,
maintained, and fairly disclosed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> is responsible for
providing appropriate reports to those who oversee their actions
and to the public in order to be accountable for the resources used
to carry out government programs and the results of these
programs.


1.20
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> is responsible for addressing the findings and
recommendations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, and for establishing and maintaining a
process to track the status of such findings and
recommendations.


1.21
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> is responsible for following sound procurement
practices when contracting for audits and attestation engagements,
including procedures for monitoring contract performance, need to
be in place. The objectives and scope of the assignment need to be
made clear. In addition to price, other factors that may be
considered in evaluating bid proposals include the responsiveness
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX> to the request for proposal; the experience of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX>; the availability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who have the
appropriate professional qualifications and technical abilities;
and the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bidder</ENAMEX>'s peer reviews.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>' Responsibilities


1.22
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> in discharging their professional
responsibilities need to observe the principles of serving the
public interest and maintaining the highest sense of integrity,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">objectivity</ENAMEX>, and independence. These principles are fundamental to
the responsibilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and the auditing
profession.


1.23
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible to accept the obligation to act
in a way that will serve the public interest, honor the public
trust, and uphold their professionalism. A distinguishing mark of a
profession is acceptance of its responsibility to the public. This
responsibility is critical when auditing in the government
environment. Because the concept of accountability underlies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>,
this need to serve the public interest is essential for all work
done in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.


1.24
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> need to make decisions that are consistent with
the public interest in the program or activity under audit. The
public interest is defined as the collective wellbeing of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> serves. In discharging
their professional responsibilities, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may encounter
conflicting pressures from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,
various levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>, and others who rely on the
objectivity and independence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>. In resolving those
conflicts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible to act with integrity, guided
by the precept that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> fulfill their responsibilities to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>' interests are
best served.


1.25
To maintain and broaden public confidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> need
to perform all professional responsibilities with the highest sense
of integrity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible to be honest and candid with
the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work in the conduct
of their work, within the constraints of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
confidentiality. Service and the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> should not be
subordinated to personal gain and advantage. Integrity can
accommodate the inadvertent error and the honest difference of
opinion; it cannot accommodate deceit or subordination of
principle. Integrity requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to


observe both the form and the spirit of technical and ethical
standards; circumvention of those standards constitutes
subordination of judgment. Integrity also requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to
observe the principles of objectivity and independence.


1.26
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible to maintain objectivity and be
free of conflicts of interest in discharging their professional
responsibilities. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are also responsible to be independent
in fact and appearance when providing audit and attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. Objectivity is a state of mind that requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to
be impartial, intellectually honest, and free of conflicts of
interest. Independence precludes relationships that may in fact or
appearance impair an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s objectivity in performing the audit.
The maintenance of objectivity and independence requires continuing
assessment of relationships with the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and public
responsibility.


1.27
In applying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible for using
professional judgment when establishing scope and methodologies for
their work, determining the tests and procedures to be performed,
conducting the work, and reporting the results. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> need to
maintain integrity and objectivity when doing their work to make
decisions that are consistent with the broader public interest in
the program or activity under review. When reporting on the results
of their work, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible for disclosing all material
or significant facts known to them which, if not disclosed, could
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mislead</ENAMEX> knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, misrepresent the results, or conceal
improper or unlawful practices.


1.28
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible for helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and other
report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> understand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' responsibilities under GAGAS
and other audit coverage required by law or regulation. To help
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and other report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> understand an audit's objectives,
time frames, and data needs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> need to communicate
information concerning the planning, conduct, and reporting of the
assignment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> involved.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Organizations</ENAMEX>' Responsibilities


1.29
Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also have the responsibility for
ensuring that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) independence and objectivity are maintained in
all phases of the assignment, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) professional judgment is used in
planning and performing the work and in reporting the results, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
the work is performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> who are professionally
competent, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) their systems of quality control are
periodically examined by independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> to ensure that they have
in place appropriately designed policies, procedures, and practices
that are functioning effectively to meet professional
standards.


1.30
While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is responsible for addressing audit and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">attestation</TIMEX> engagement findings and recommendations and tracking
their status of resolution, audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are responsible for
establishing policies and procedures for follow-up to determine
whether previous findings and recommendations are addressed and are
considered in planning future assignments.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>


2.1
This <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX> describes the types of audits and
attestation engagements that audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> perform, or
arrange to have performed, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, programs<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">,1 and</NUMEX> of
government assistance administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>, nonprofit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>, and other nongovernment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. This description is not
intended to limit or require the types of audits or attestation
engagements that may be performed or arranged to be performed. In
performing work described below in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chapters 3</ENAMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> also describes other
professional services that audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> provide, although
these services are not covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.


2.2
All assignments begin with objectives, and those
objectives determine the type of work to be performed and the audit
standards to be followed. The types of work, as defined by their
objectives that are covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, are classified in these
standards as financial audits, attestation engagements, and
performance audits.


2.3
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assignments</ENAMEX> may have a combination of objectives that
include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> type of work described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> or may
have objectives limited to only some aspects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of work.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should follow the standards that are applicable to the
individual objectives of the audit or attestation
engagement.

subject matter of an attestation engagement may take many forms,
including historical or prospective performance or condition,
physical characteristics, historical events, analyses, systems and
processes, or behavior. Attestation engagements can cover a broad
range of financial or nonfinancial objectives and can be part of a
financial audit or other type of audit. Examples of objectives of
attestation engagements include reporting on

an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s internal control over financial
reporting;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>

PERFORMANCE AUDITS
2.8 A performance audit is an objective and systematic
examination of evidence to provide an independent assessment of the
performance and management of a program against objective criteria
or an assessment of best practices and other information.
Performance audits provide information to improve program
operations and facilitate decisionmaking by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> with
responsibility to oversee or initiate corrective action, and
improve public accountability. Performance audits encompass a wide
variety of
5Some of these examples of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">attestation</TIMEX> engagement objectives are
similar to some of the performance audit objectives listed in
paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.11</NUMEX>. Depending on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">auditor</ENAMEX>'s qualifications, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> may choose to apply
performance audit standards in chapters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 and 8</NUMEX> to the objectives
in paragraph <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> instead of following the attestation standards in
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chapter 6</ENAMEX>.
6GAGAS incorporate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s general attestation standard on
criteria and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s field work and reporting attestation
standards and the related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAEs</ENAMEX> unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> of

objectives including objectives related to assessing program
effectiveness and results; economy and efficiency; internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control;7</ENAMEX> and compliance with legal or other requirements; and
objectives related to providing prospective analyses, guidance, or
summary information. Performance audits also may encompass a broad
or narrow scope of work and a variety of methodologies; involve a
level of analysis, research, or evaluation; generally provide
conclusions and recommendations; and result in a report. (See
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chapters 3, 7</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> for standards and guidance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
performing a performance audit in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.)
2.9 Program effectiveness and results audit objectives address
the effectiveness of a program and typically measure the extent to
which a program is achieving its goals and objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Economy and</ENAMEX>
efficiency audit objectives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> whether an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> is acquiring,
protecting, and using its resources in the most productive manner
to achieve program objectives. These audit objectives are often
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interrelated</ENAMEX> and may be concurrently addressed in a performance
audit. Examples of program effectiveness and results and economy
and efficiency audit objectives include assessing


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
the extent to which legislative, regulatory, or
organizational goals and objectives are being achieved;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
the relative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of alternative approaches to yield
better program performance or eliminate factors that inhibit
program effectiveness;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
the relative cost and benefits or cost effectiveness of
program performance;8


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
whether a program produced intended results or produced

stated objectives;


7The term internal control in this document is synonymous with
the term management control and, unless otherwise stated, covers
all aspects of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s operations (programmatic, financial, and
compliance). 8These objectives focus on combining cost information
with information about outputs or the benefit provided, and
outcomes or the results achieved.

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control audit objectives relate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s
plans, methods, and procedures used to meet its mission, goals, and
objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> controls include the processes and procedures
for planning, organizing, directing, and controlling program
operations, and the system put in place for measuring, reporting,
and monitoring program performance. Examples of audit objectives
related to internal control include the extent that internal
controls of a program provide reasonable assurance that


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
organizational missions, goals, and objectives are
achieved effectively and efficiently;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> are used in compliance with laws, regulations,
or other requirements;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> are safeguarded against unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition;


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
management information and public reports that are
produced, such as performance measures, are complete, accurate, and
consistent to document performance and support
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisionmaking</ENAMEX>;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
security over computerized information systems will
prevent or detect unauthorized access; and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>
contingency planning for information systems provides
essential back-up to prevent unwarranted disruption of activities
and functions the systems support.




2.11
Compliance audit objectives relate to compliance criteria
established by laws, regulations, contract provisions, grant
agreements, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">requirements9</ENAMEX> that could affect the
acquisition, protection, and use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s resources, and the
quantity, quality, timeliness, and cost of services the entity
produces and delivers. Compliance objectives also concern the
purpose of the program, the manner in which it is to be conducted
and services delivered, and the population it serves.


2.12
Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are increasingly undertaking work
that is similar to the traditional performance audit but may have a
prospective focus or may provide guidance, best practice
information, or information on cross-cutting issues already studied
or under study by an audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. While this work generally
does not involve assessing specific ongoing programs, it may use
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from relevant audit work for comparative or baseline purposes.
This performance-related work may encompass a broad or narrow range
of objectives and scope of work; use a variety of methodologies;
involve a level of analysis, research, or evaluation; generally
provide conclusions and recommendations; and result in a report. It
is also subject to the same standards as performance audits.
Examples of objectives pertaining to this work include




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
assessing program or policy alternatives, including
forecasting program outcomes under various assumptions;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
assessing the advantages and disadvantages of legislative
proposals;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
conducting surveys to obtain and analyze views of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> on policy proposals for decisionmakers;


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
analyzing budget proposals or budget requests to assist
legislatures in the budget process;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
developing methods or approaches for use in evaluating
new or proposed programs;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>
producing a high-level summary or a report that affects
multiple programs or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> on issues studied or under study by
the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>; and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>
developing guidance documents such as those based on best
practices research and syntheses for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s use in evaluating
program or management system approaches, including financial and

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> may also provide nonaudit services that
are not covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. These nonaudit services consist of
gathering, providing, or explaining information requested by
decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> or providing advice or assistance to management
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. Nonaudit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> generally differ from financial
audits, attestation engagements, and performance audits described
above in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> provide information or data to a requesting
party without providing verification, analysis, or evaluation of
the information or data, and therefore the work does not usually
provide a basis for conclusions, recommendations, or opinions on
the information or data. These other services may or may not result
in a report. Some examples of these other professional services
include

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GENERAL STANDARDS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>


3.1
This chapter prescribes general standards and provides
guidance for performing financial audits, attestation engagements<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>
and performance audits. These general standards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> the
fundamental requirements for ensuring the credibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
results. Credibility is essential to all audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
performing work that government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> rely on for
making decisions, and is what the public expects of information
provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>. These general standards encompass the
independence of the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and its individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>;
the exercise of professional judgment in the performance of work
and the preparation of related reports; the competence of audit
staff, including their continuing professional education; and the
existence of quality control systems and external peer
reviews.


3.2
These general standards provide the underlying framework
that is critical in effectively applying the field work and
reporting standards described in the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, in
performing the detailed work associated with the assignment, and in
preparing related reports and other products. Therefore, these
general standards are required to be followed by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and
audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and nongovernment, performing
work under generally accepted government auditing standards
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>).


1See <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 6</ENAMEX> for an additional general standard auditors
should follow when performing an attestation engagement.

[<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Refer to Amendment</ENAMEX> No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>. The following paragraph
numbers will change accordingly.]
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT</ENAMEX>
3.3 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> general standard is:
Professional judgment should be used in planning and performing
audits and attestation engagements, and in reporting the
results.


3.4
This standard requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to observe the principles
of serving the public interest and maintaining the highest sense of
integrity, objectivity, and independence in applying professional
judgment2 in all aspects of their work. This standard also imposes
a responsibility upon each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> within the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observe GAGAS</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> hold themselves out as following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>,
regardless of whether they are required to follow such standards,
they need to justify any departures from them.


3.5
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should use professional judgment in determining
the type of assignment to be performed and the standards that apply
to the work; establishing the scope of work; selecting the
methodology; determining the type and amount of evidence to be
gathered; and choosing the tests and procedures for their work.
Professional judgment also should be applied in performing the
tests and procedures and in evaluating and reporting the results of
the work.


2Professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">judgment</ENAMEX> is synonymous with due professional care
as defined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Institute of Certified Public</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountants</ENAMEX> (AICPA) standards. While the principles of serving the
public interest and maintaining the highest sense of integrity,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">objectivity</ENAMEX>, and independence are not explicitly stated in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s due professional care standard, these principles serve as
the framework for all AICPA rules and standards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>


3.6
Professional judgment requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to exercise
professional skepticism, which is an attitude that includes a
questioning mind and a critical assessment of evidence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
use the knowledge, skills, and experience called for by their
profession to diligently perform, in good faith and with integrity,
the gathering of evidence and objective evaluation of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">competency</ENAMEX> and sufficiency of evidence. Since evidence is gathered
and evaluated throughout the assignment, professional skepticism
should be exercised throughout the assignment.


3.7
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> neither assume that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is dishonest nor
assume unquestioned honesty. In exercising professional skepticism,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should not be satisfied with less than persuasive evidence
because of a belief that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is honest.


3.8
The exercise of professional judgment allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>
to obtain reasonable assurance that material misstatements or
significant inaccuracies in data will be detected if they exist.
Absolute assurance is not attainable because of the nature of
evidence and the characteristics of fraud. Therefore, an audit or
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">attestation</TIMEX> engagement conducted in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> may not
detect a material misstatement or significant inaccuracy, whether
from error or fraud. Accordingly, while this standard places
responsibility on each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> and audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to exercise
professional judgment in planning and performing an assignment, it
does not imply unlimited responsibility, nor does it imply
infallibility on the part of either the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> or the
audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMPETENCE</ENAMEX>
3.9 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> general standard is:
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> assigned to perform the assignment should collectively
possess adequate professional competence for the tasks
required.


3.10
This standard places responsibility on audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> to ensure that each assignment is performed by staff
who collectively have the knowledge, skills, and experience
necessary for that assignment. Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should have a
process, such as a human capital system, for recruitment, hiring,
continuous development, and evaluation of staff to assist the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in maintaining a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> that has adequate
competence.


3.11
The competencies discussed below apply to the knowledge,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX>, and experience of audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> as a whole and not
necessarily to each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> may need to
employ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or hire subject matter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> who are
knowledgeable, skilled, or experienced in such areas as accounting,
statistics, law, engineering, audit design and methodology,
information technology, public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, economics, social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sciences</ENAMEX>, or actuarial science.


Technical <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Knowledge and Competence</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.12</NUMEX> Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> conducting audits and attestation engagements
under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should collectively possess the technical knowledge,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX>, and experience necessary to be competent for the type of
work being performed before beginning work on an assignment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should possess


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
knowledge of government auditing standards applicable to
the type of work they are assigned and the education, skills, and
experience to apply such knowledge to the work being
performed;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
knowledge of the specific environment in which the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> operates and the subject matter under
review;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
skills to communicate clearly and effectively, both
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orally</ENAMEX> and in writing; and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
skills appropriate for the work being performed. For

if the work involves review of complex engineering data,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> should include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with
engineering expertise; or


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
if the work involves the use of specialized audit
methodologies or analytical techniques, such as the use of complex
survey instruments, actuarial-based estimates, or statistical
analysis tests, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> should
include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with expertise in those methodologies.


3.13 The following additional competencies are needed for
financial audits.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should be knowledgeable in generally accepted
accounting principles and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s generally accepted auditing
standards for field work and reporting and the related statements
on the standards (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX>) when performing a financial audit and
should be competent in applying these standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX> to the
task assigned. Similarly, when performing an attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagement</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should be knowledgeable in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attestation</ENAMEX> standard related to criteria, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s
attestation standards for field work and reporting and the related
statements on the standards for attestation engagements (SSAEs),
and should be competent in applying these standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSAEs</ENAMEX> to
the task assigned.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> engaged to perform financial audits or
attestation engagements should be (a) licensed certified public
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> working for a licensed certified public
accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, or (b) public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> licensed on or

Continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Education</ENAMEX>


3.14
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> performing work under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> need to maintain
their professional competence through continuing professional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> (CPE). Therefore, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> performing work under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should complete, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 2 years</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 80 hours</TIMEX> of CPE
which directly contributes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s professional
proficiency to perform such work. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">least 20 hours</TIMEX> should be
completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any 1 year of the 2-year</TIMEX> period.


3.15
Continuing education may include such topics as
developments in audit standards and methodology, accounting,
assessment of internal control, principles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX>, information systems <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sampling</ENAMEX>,
financial statement analysis, evaluation design, and data analysis.
It may also include subjects related to specific fields of work,
such as public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, public policy and structure,
industrial engineering, finance, economics, social sciences, and
information technology.


3.16
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> responsible for planning or
directing an assignment, performing substantial portions of the
field work<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX> or reporting on the assignment under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should
complete <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 24</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPE</ENAMEX> in subjects directly
related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> environment and to government auditing.
If the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> operates in a specific or unique environment,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPE</ENAMEX> that is related to that
environment.


3Accountants and accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> meeting these licensing
requirements should also comply with the applicable provisions of
the public accountancy law and rules of the jurisdiction(s) where
the audit is being conducted and the jurisdiction(s) in which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> are licensed.
4Auditors are considered responsible for "conducting substantial
portions of field work" when, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> CPE year, time chargeable
to audits and attestation engagements following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX>
or more of their total chargeable time.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>


3.17
The audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is responsible for ensuring that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> meet the continuing education requirements. The audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> should maintain documentation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPE</ENAMEX> completed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has developed guidance pertaining to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CPE</ENAMEX> requirements to assist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in exercising professional
judgment in complying with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CPE</ENAMEX> requirements<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>


3.18
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">External</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> and internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and specialists
should be qualified and maintain professional competence in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of expertise and/or specialization. However, they are not
required to meet the above <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CPE</ENAMEX> requirements unless they are
responsible for following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> in planning or directing the
assignment, performing substantial portions of field work, or
reporting on the assignment.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE</ENAMEX>
3.19 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> general standard is:
Each audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> performing assignments in accordance
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should have an appropriate internal quality control
system in place and should undergo an external peer review.
3.20 The internal quality control system established by the
audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should provide reasonable assurance that it is
following (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) adequate quality control policies and procedures, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) applicable government auditing standards. The internal quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> should include procedures for monitoring, on an
ongoing basis, whether the policies and procedures related to the
standards are suitably designed and are being effectively
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX>.

3.21
The nature and extent of an audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s internal
quality control system depends on a number of factors, such as its
size, the degree of operating autonomy allowed its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and
its audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, the nature of its work, its organizational
structure, and appropriate cost-benefit considerations. Thus the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> established by individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> will vary as will
the need for, and extent of, their documentation of the systems.
However, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should prepare appropriate documentation
to demonstrate compliance with its policies and procedures for its
system of quality control.


3.22
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> performing assignments in accordance
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should have an external peer review conducted at least
once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 3 years</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> independent of the organization
being reviewed<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> The external peer review should determine whether
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s internal quality control system is in place and
operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that
established policies and procedures and applicable government
auditing standards are being followed.


3.23
An external peer review under this standard should meet
the following requirements.




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> conducting peer reviews of an audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s system of quality control should have thorough
knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> environment relative to
the work being reviewed.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reviewers</ENAMEX> should be independent (as defined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>) of
the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> being reviewed, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and the
assignments selected for review. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is not permitted
to review the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that conducted its most recent external
peer review. Also, the employing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the peer reviewers
should


6Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should have an external peer review
conducted within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years</TIMEX> from the date they start (that is, start
of field work) their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> assignment in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.
Subsequent external peer reviews should be conducted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 3 years</TIMEX>.
Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should generally maintain their review year
from review to review. Any extensions of these time frames to meet
the external peer review requirements can only be granted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
and should only be requested for extraordinary circumstances.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
have received an unqualified opinion on the review of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s system of quality controls.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reviewers</ENAMEX> should have knowledge and training on how to
perform a peer review and should use professional judgment in
conducting and reporting the results of the review.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
This review should include a review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> quality control policies and procedures, reports, audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX>, and other necessary documents (for example,
independence statements, outside employment requests, financial
disclosure reports, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPE</ENAMEX> documentation). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review</ENAMEX> should also
include contacts with various levels of the reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to assess their understanding of and compliance
with relevant quality control policies and procedures.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reviewers</ENAMEX> should use one of the following approaches to
selecting assignments for review: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) select assignments that
provide a reasonable cross section of the assignments performed by
the reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> or




(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
select assignments that provide a reasonable cross
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> of the reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s work subject to quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> requirements, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more assignments performed
in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review</ENAMEX> should be sufficiently comprehensive to
provide a reasonable basis for concluding whether the reviewed
audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s system of quality control was complied with to
provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> with reasonable assurance of conforming
with professional standards in the conduct of its work. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Reviewers</ENAMEX>
may scale back the peer review procedures based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>'
evaluation of the adequacy and results of the reviewed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s monitoring efforts.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reviewers</ENAMEX> should prepare a written report(s)
communicating the results of the external peer review. The report
should indicate the scope of the review, including


any limitations thereon, and should express an opinion on
whether the system of quality control of the reviewed organization
was in place and operating effectively to provide reasonable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> that established policies and procedures and applicable
government auditing standards are followed. The report should also
describe the reason(s) for any modifications to the opinion. When
there are matters that resulted in a modification to the standard
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> should report a detailed description of the
findings and recommendations to enable the reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to
take appropriate actions. To help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the peer review report
understand the peer review process, each report should be
accompanied by an attachment describing the process, including how
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peer</ENAMEX> reviews are planned and performed.


3.24
Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> seeking to enter into a contract to
perform an assignment in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should provide their
most recent external peer review <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">report7</TIMEX> to the party contracting
for the audit or attestation engagement. Information in the
external peer review report often would be relevant to decisions on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">procuring</ENAMEX> audit or attestation engagement services.


3.25
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> who are relying on another audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
work should request a copy of the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s peer review
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>, and the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should provide the peer review
report when requested. Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also should transmit
their external peer review reports to appropriate oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>.
It is also recommended that the report be made available to the
public in a timely manner.

4.1
Generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS)
incorporate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</ENAMEX>'
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>) generally accepted field work standards for audits and the
related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA Statements on Auditing Standards</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX>) unless the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> excludes them by formal
announcement<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.1</TIMEX> This chapter identifies the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AICPA</ENAMEX> field work
standards and prescribes additional standards for applying the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AICPA</ENAMEX> field work standards for financial audits performed in
accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. This chapter concludes with guidance that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should give consideration to when performing financial
audits in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.


4.2
Financial audits consist of all work performed under the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s generally accepted auditing standards and governed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA SASs</ENAMEX>, which interpret the standards. Such work performed in a
government environment primarily includes audits of financial
statements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX> also govern other types of services which may
also be performed in a government environment, such as compliance
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">auditing</ENAMEX>, issuing special reports<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,3</NUMEX> audits of service
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, reviews of interim


1To <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">date</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> has not excluded any field
work standards or statements on auditing standards.
2The term "financial statement" refers to a presentation of
financial data, including accompanying notes, derived from
accounting records and intended to communicate an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> or obligations at a point in time or the changes therein
for a period of time in conformity with an identifiable framework,
such as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or an other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> basis of accounting (OCBOA). Audits of financial
statements include all services governed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX> for
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are engaged to provide a level of assurance on
the fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with a
stated criteria.
3Special reports apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' reports issued in connection
with the following: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) financial statements that are prepared in
conformity with a comprehensive basis of accounting other than
generally accepted accounting principles; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) specified elements,
accounts, or items of a financial statement; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) compliance with

financial information, and issuing letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underwriters</ENAMEX> and
certain other requesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. These other services may be
performed in conjunction with an audit of financial statements.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIELD WORK STANDARDS</ENAMEX>
4.3 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> generally accepted standards of field work
are as follows.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
The work is to be adequately planned, and assistants, if
any, are to be properly supervised.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
A sufficient understanding of internal control is to be
obtained to plan the audit and to determine the nature, timing, and
extent of tests to be performed.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Sufficient competent evidential matter is to be obtained
through inspection, observation, inquiries, and confirmations to
afford a reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial
statements under audit.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADDITIONAL GAGAS FIELD WORK STANDARDS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">GAGAS</ENAMEX> prescribe additional standards for applying the AICPA
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> generally accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> field work standards which go beyond
the requirements contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SASs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> must
comply with these additional standards when citing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> in their
audit reports. The additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> relate to


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
auditor communication (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX> through
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.13</NUMEX>),


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
considering the results of previous audits (see

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
noncompliance with provisions of contracts and grants
(see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.17</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.19</NUMEX>), and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
audit documentation (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.20</NUMEX> through
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.24</NUMEX>).


4.5 This chapter concludes with guidance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should give
consideration to when performing financial audits in accordance
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> for the following areas:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
audit risk and materiality (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.26</NUMEX> and

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUDITOR COMMUNICATION</ENAMEX>
4.6 An additional standard related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> communication for
financial audits performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate information regarding the nature of

equivalent oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.7</NUMEX> AICPA standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to establish an
understanding with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> and to communicate with audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX>. GAGAS broaden the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> with whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> must
communicate with during the planning stages of a financial audit to
reduce the risk that the needs or expectations of the parties
involved may be misinterpreted. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should use their
professional judgment to determine the form, content, and frequency
of the communication, although written communication is preferred,
and should document the communication. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may use an
engagement letter, if appropriate, to communicate the
information.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate their responsibilities for the
engagement to the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,
which may include


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> or other
equivalent oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> in the absence of an audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>,
and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> who possesses a sufficient level of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> and responsibility for the financial reporting process,
such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief financial officer</ENAMEX>.


4.9 In situations where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are performing the audit under
a contract with a party other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>, or pursuant to a third-party request, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should also
communicate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> contracting for or requesting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audit</ENAMEX>, such as contracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> or legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> or
staff. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are performing the audit pursuant to a law or
regulation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate with the legislative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who have oversight of the auditee<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>

use the engagement letter to keep interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> informed.
4.10 In communicating the nature of services and level of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> provided, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should specifically address their
planned work related to testing compliance with laws and
regulations and
4This requirement applies only to situations where the law or
regulation specifically identifies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to be audited, such
as an audit of a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s financial statements required by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> Act, as expanded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
Management <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reform Act of 1994</ENAMEX>. Situations where the audit of
financial statements mandate applies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> not specifically
identified, such as audits required by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Single Audit Act</ENAMEX>
Amendments of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, are excluded.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control over financial reporting. During the planning
stages of an audit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate their
responsibilities for testing and reporting on compliance with laws
and regulations and internal control over financial reporting. Such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> should include the nature of any additional testing
of compliance and internal control required by laws and regulations
or otherwise requested, and whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are planning on
providing opinions on compliance with laws and regulations and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control over financial reporting.


4.11
To assist in understanding the limitations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
responsibilities for testing and reporting on compliance and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control over financial reporting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may want to
contrast those responsibilities with other audits of compliance and
controls. The discussion in paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.12</NUMEX> and


4.13
may be helpful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in explaining their
responsibilities for testing and reporting on compliance with laws
and regulations and internal control over financial reporting to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and other interested
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>.




4.12
Tests of compliance with laws and regulations and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control over financial reporting in a financial audit
contribute to the evidence supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' opinion on the
financial statements or other conclusions regarding financial data.
However, such tests generally are not sufficient in scope to opine
on compliance or internal control over financial reporting. To meet
certain audit report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' needs, laws and regulations sometimes
prescribe testing and reporting on compliance and internal control
over financial reporting to supplement coverage of these
areas<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>


4.13
Even after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> perform and report the results of
additional tests of compliance and internal control over financial
reporting required by laws and regulations, some reasonable needs
of report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> still may be unmet. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may meet these needs
by performing further tests of compliance


5For example, when engaged to perform audits under the Single
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Audit Act Amendments of 1996</ENAMEX> for state and local government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX> and nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that receive federal awards,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should be familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-133</ENAMEX> on single audits. The act and circular
include specific audit requirements, mainly in the areas of
compliance with laws and regulations and internal control, that
exceed the minimum audit requirements in the standards in chapters
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX> of this document. Audits conducted under the Chief
Financial <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Officers Act of 1990</ENAMEX>, as expanded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX>
Management <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reform Act of 1994</ENAMEX>, also have specific audit
requirements prescribed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> in the areas of compliance and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> have additional

CONSIDERING THE RESULTS OF PREVIOUS AUDITS
4.14 An additional standard for financial audits performed in
accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should consider the results of previous audits and
follow up on known significant findings and recommendations,
including those related to reportable conditions, identified in
previous audits reports that relate to the objectives of the audit
being undertaken.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should perform such follow-up to determine whether
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> have taken appropriate corrective
actions. In addition to following up on significant reported
findings and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">recommendations7</ENAMEX> from previous financial audits,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should consider significant findings identified in
attestation engagements, performance audits, or other studies if
these findings could materially affect the results of the financial
audit. For example, an audit report on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s computerized
information systems may contain significant findings that could
relate to the financial audit if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> uses such systems to
process its accounting information. In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> need to
make judgments about the extent of follow-up needed and the
appropriate disclosure of uncorrected significant findings and
recommendations from prior audits that affect the audit
objectives.
6Such work is generally performed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s Statements
on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Standards for Attestation Engagements</ENAMEX>. See chapter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> for a
discussion of the standards used when performing attestation
engagements. 7Significant findings and recommendations are those
matters that, if not corrected, could affect the results of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' conclusions about those results.
4.16 Providing continuing attention to
significant findings and recommendations is important to ensure
that the benefits of audit work are realized. Ultimately, the
benefits of audit work occur when audit findings are resolved
through meaningful and effective corrective action taken in
response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings and recommendations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX>
of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> are responsible for resolving audit findings
and recommendations directed to them, and for having a process to
track their status. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> do not have
such a process, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may wish to establish their own
process.
NONCOMPLIANCE WITH <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROVISIONS OF CONTRACTS AND GRANT</ENAMEX>
AGREEMENTS
4.17 The additional standard related to compliance with
provisions of contracts and grant agreements for financial audits
performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should design the audit to provide reasonable assurance
of detecting material misstatements of financial statements or
other financial data resulting from noncompliance with provisions
of contracts or grant agreements that have a direct and material
effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of financial statement amounts. If
specific information comes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' attention that provides
evidence concerning the existence of possible noncompliance that
could affect financial data significant to the audit objectives or
that could have a material indirect effect on the financial
statements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should apply audit procedures specifically
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> to ascertaining whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">noncompliance</ENAMEX> has occurred or is
likely to have occurred.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.18</NUMEX> AICPA standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to assess the
risk of material misstatements of financial statements due to fraud
and should consider that assessment in designing the audit
procedures to be performed<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are also required to design
the audit to provide reasonable assurance of detecting material
misstatements resulting from direct and material illegal acts to
be
8Two types of misstatements are relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
consideration of fraud in an audit of financial statements-
misstatements arising from fraudulent financial statements and
misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets. The primary
factor that distinguishes fraud from error is whether the
underlying action that results in the misstatement in the financial
statements is intentional or unintentional.
aware of the possibility that indirect illegal acts may have
occurred. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, the term noncompliance, however, has a
broader meaning than fraud and illegal acts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noncompliance</ENAMEX> includes
not only fraud and illegal acts, but also violations of provisions
of contracts or grant agreements.
4.19 Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have the same responsibilities for
detecting material misstatements arising from other types of
noncompliance as they do for detecting those arising from fraud and
illegal acts. Direct and material noncompliance is noncompliance
having a direct and material effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
financial statement amounts or could have a significant effect on
other financial data needed to achieve audit objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
should design the audit to provide reasonable assurance of
detecting material misstatements resulting from direct and material
noncompliance with provisions of contracts or grant agreements.
Indirect noncompliance is noncompliance having material but
indirect effects on financial statements or other financial data
needed to achieve audit objectives. If specific information comes
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' attention that provides evidence concerning the
existence of possible noncompliance that could have a material
indirect effect on the financial statements or significant indirect
effect on other financial data need to achieve audit objectives,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should apply audit procedures specifically directed to
ascertaining whether that noncompliance has occurred or is likely
to have occurred.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUDIT DOCUMENTATION</ENAMEX>
4.20 An additional standard related to audit documentation for
financial audits performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
Audit documentation should contain sufficient information to
enable an experienced reviewer, who has had no previous connection
with the audit, to ascertain from the audit documentation the
evidence that supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' significant judgments and
conclusions. Audit documentation that supports significant
findings, conclusions, and recommendations should be complete
before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> issue their report.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.21</NUMEX> AICPA standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to prepare and
maintain audit documentation. The form and content of audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> should be designed to meet the circumstances of the
particular audit. The information contained in audit documentation
constitutes the principal record of the work that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have
performed and the conclusions that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have reached. The
quantity, type, and content of audit documentation is a matter of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' professional judgment.
However, audits performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> are subject
to review by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> and by oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> more
frequently than audits done in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards.
Thus, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards cite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main purposes of audit
documentation--providing the principal support for the audit report
and aiding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in performing and supervising the audit--audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">documentation</ENAMEX> serves an additional purpose in audits performed in
accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. Audit documentation allows for the review of
audit quality by providing the reviewer documentation, either in
written or electronic formats, of the evidence supporting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' significant judgments and conclusions.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit</ENAMEX> documentation for financial audits performed under

The consideration that the planned audit procedures are

4.23
Underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audits is that federal, state, and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> cooperate in auditing programs
of common interest so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may use others' work and avoid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplicate</ENAMEX> audit efforts. In addition, audits performed in
accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> are subject to quality control and assurance
reviews. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should make arrangements to make audit
documentation available, upon request, in a timely manner to other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>. Contractual arrangements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audits
should provide for full and timely access to audit documentation to
facilitate reliance by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work, as
well as reviews of audit quality control and assurance.


4.24
Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should establish reasonable policies
and procedures for the safe custody and retention of audit
documentation for a time sufficient to satisfy legal and
administrative requirements. If audit documentation is only
retained electronically, the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should ensure that
the electronic documentation is capable of being accessed
throughout the specified

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR FINANCIAL AUDITS PERFORMED IN</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ACCORDANCE WITH</ENAMEX> GAGAS
4.25 As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 1</ENAMEX>, financial audits contribute to
making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> more accountable for the use of public resources
and the delivery of services. Because of the increased
accountability associated with government audits, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
performing financial audits in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should
consider the following guidance related to audit risk and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">materiality</ENAMEX> (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.26 and 4.27</NUMEX>), internal control over
safeguarding of assets (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.28</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.33</NUMEX>), internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over compliance (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.34</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.36</NUMEX>), and
professional judgment concerning possible fraud and illegal acts
(see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.37 and 4.39</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Risk</ENAMEX> and Materiality


4.26
The AICPA standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require that the work is to
be properly planned, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should consider audit risk and
materiality, among other matters, in determining the nature,
timing, and extent of auditing procedures and in evaluating the
results of those procedures. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>' consideration of audit risk
and materiality is a matter of professional judgment and is
influenced by their perception of the needs of a reasonable person
who will rely on the financial statements. Materiality judgments
are made in light of surrounding circumstances and necessarily
involve both quantitative and qualitative
considerations.


4.27
In an audit of a government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that
receives government assistance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may need to set lower
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">materiality</ENAMEX> levels than in audits in the private sector because of
the public accountability of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, the various legal
and regulatory requirements, and the visibility and sensitivity of
government programs, activities, and functions.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control Over Safeguarding of Assets</ENAMEX>


4.28
Safeguarding of assets is an internal control objective.
that is especially important in performing financial audits of
governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> or others receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> funds.11 Given
the public accountability for stewardship of resources,
safeguarding of assets permeates control objectives and components
as defined by the AICPA standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.


4.29
As applied to financial audits, internal control over
safeguarding of assets constitutes a process, effected by an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and other personnel designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.


4.30
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control over the safeguarding of assets relates
to the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized transactions
and unauthorized access to assets that could result in losses that
are material to the financial statements, such as when unauthorized
expenditures or investments are made, unauthorized liabilities are
incurred, inventory is stolen, or assets are converted to personal
use. Such controls are designed to help ensure the use of and
access to assets are in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s authorization.
Authorization includes approval of transactions in accordance with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> activities established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to safeguard assets,
such as establishing and complying with requirements for extending
and monitoring credit or making investment decisions, and related
documentation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> over safeguarding of assets is not designed
to protect against loss of assets arising from inefficiency or from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s operating decisions, such as incurring expenditures
for equipment or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> that proves to be unnecessary or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unsatisfactory</ENAMEX>.


4.31
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to obtain a
sufficient understanding of internal control to plan the audit.
They also require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to plan the audit to provide reasonable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> of detecting material fraud, including material
misappropriation of assets. Because preventing or


11Auditors should apply the guidance contained in this section
to other types of financial audits to the extent it is applicable
to the nature of the engagement.
detecting material misappropriations is an objective of control
over safeguarding of assets, understanding this type of control can
be essential to planning the audit.


4.32
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> over safeguarding of assets is not limited to
preventing or detecting misappropriations. It also helps prevent or
detect other material losses that could result from unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of assets. Such controls include,
for example, the process of assessing the risk of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of assets and establishing control
activities to help ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> directives to address the
risk are carried out. Such control activities would include
permitting acquisition, use, or disposition of assets only in
accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s general or specific authorization,
including compliance with established control activities for such
acquisition, use, or disposition. They would also include comparing
existing assets with the related records at reasonable intervals
and taking appropriate action with respect to any differences.
Finally, controls over safeguarding of assets against unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition also relate to making available to
management information it needs to carry out its responsibilities
related to prevention or timely detection of such unauthorized
activities, as well as mechanisms to enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to monitor
the continued effective operation of such controls.


4.33
Understanding the control over safeguarding of assets can
help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> assess the risk that financial statements could be
materially misstated. For example, an understanding of the audited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s control over the safeguarding of assets can help auditors
recognize risk factors such as




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
failure to adequately monitor decentralized
operations;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
lack of control over activities, such as lack of
separation of duties or approval for major transactions;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
lack of control over computerized information systems,
such as a lack of control over access to applications that initiate
or control the movement of assets;


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
failure to develop or communicate adequate control
activities for security of data or assets, such as allowing
unauthorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to have ready access to data or assets;
and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
failure to investigate significant unreconciled
differences between reconciliations of a control account and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiary</ENAMEX> records.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control</ENAMEX> Over Compliance


4.34
Governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> are subject to a variety of laws
and regulations that affect their financial statements or other
financial data, which is a major factor distinguishing governmental
accounting from private-sector accounting. For example, such laws
and regulations may address the required fund structure,
procurement or debt limitations, or authority for transactions.
Accordingly, compliance with such laws and regulations may have a
direct and material effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of amounts in the
financial statements of governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. Likewise, entities
that receive government assistance, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>, nonprofit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>, and other nongovernmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, are also subject to
regulations, contract provisions, or grant agreements that could
have a direct and material effect on their financial statements.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX>, of both governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and others receiving
governmental assistance, is responsible for ensuring that the
entity complies with not only the laws and regulations but also
contract provisions and grant agreements applicable to its
activities. That responsibility encompasses the identification of
applicable laws, regulations, contract provisions, and grant
agreements, as well as the establishment of controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> complies with those
laws, regulations, contract provisions, and grant
agreements.


4.35
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to design the
audit to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free of material misstatements resulting from noncompliance
that have a direct and material effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
financial statement amounts. To meet this requirement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should have an understanding of internal control relevant to
financial statement assertions affected by those laws, regulations,
contract provisions, or grant agreements. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may find it
necessary to use the work of legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> in (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
determining


which laws and regulations might have a direct and material
effect on the financial statements, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) designing tests of
compliance with laws and regulations, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) evaluating the
results of those tests<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> also may find it necessary to
use the work of legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> when an audit requires testing
compliance with provisions of contracts or grant agreements.
Depending on the circumstances of the audit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may find it
necessary to obtain information on compliance matters from others,
such as investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that provided assistance to the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,
and/or the applicable law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.36</NUMEX> AICPA standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> use their
understanding of internal control relevant to financial statement
assertions affected by laws and regulations to identify types of
potential misstatements, consider factors that affect the risk of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material misstatement</ENAMEX>, and design substantive tests. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> extends
this requirement to include contract provisions and grant
agreements. In applying this requirement, the following factors may
influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' assessment of control risk:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s awareness or lack of awareness of applicable
laws, regulations, contract provisions, or grant
agreements;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
policy of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> regarding such matters as
acceptable operating practices and codes of conduct; and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
assignment of responsibility and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> of authority
to deal with such matters as organizational goals and objectives,
operating functions, and regulatory requirements.


12AICPA standards provide guidance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> who use the work
of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> who is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Judgment</ENAMEX> Concerning Possible
Fraud and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Illegal Acts</ENAMEX>


4.37
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible
for being aware of the characteristics and types of potentially
material fraud that could be associated with the area being audited
so that they can plan the audit to provide reasonable assurance of
detecting material misstatements of the financial statements due to
fraud.


4.38
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should exercise professional judgment in
pursuing indications of possible fraud and illegal acts so as not
to interfere with potential future investigations, legal
proceedings, or both. Under some circumstances, laws, regulations,
or policies may require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to report indications of certain
types of fraud or illegal acts to law enforcement or investigatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> before extending audit steps and procedures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
may also be required to withdraw from or defer further work on the
audit or a portion of the audit in order not to interfere with an
investigation.


4.39
An audit made in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> will not guarantee
the discovery of fraud or illegal acts or contingent liabilities
resulting from them. Nor does the subsequent discovery of illegal
acts committed during the audit period mean that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
performance was inadequate, provided the audit was made in
accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.

report issuance and distribution. (See paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.35</NUMEX>
through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.38</NUMEX>).


5.2 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> generally accepted standards of reporting are
as follows.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
The report shall state whether the financial statements
are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
The report shall identify those circumstances in which
such principles have not been consistently observed in the current
period in relation to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding</TIMEX> period.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Informative disclosures in the financial statements are
to be regarded as reasonably adequate unless otherwise stated in
the report.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
The report shall either contain an expression of opinion
regarding the financial statements, taken as a whole, or an
assertion to the effect that an opinion cannot be expressed. When
an overall opinion cannot be expressed, the reasons therefor should
be stated. In all cases where an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s name is associated with
financial statements, the report should contain a clear-cut
indication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s work, if any, and the
degree of responsibility the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> is taking.


<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">REPORTING COMPLIANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED GOVERNMENT AUDITING</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STANDARDS</ENAMEX>
5.3 An additional reporting standard for financial audits
conducted in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
Audit reports should state that the audit was made in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards.


5.4
The above statement refers to all the applicable
standards that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should have followed during their
audit. The statement referencing compliance with generally accepted
government auditing standards should be qualified in situations
where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> did not follow an applicable standard. In these
situations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should disclose in the scope section of
the report the applicable standard that was not followed, the
reasons therefore, and how not following the standard affected, or
could have affected, the results of the audit.


5.5
When the report on the financial audit is submitted to
comply with a legal, regulatory, or contractual requirement for a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audit, it should specifically cite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. The report on the
financial audit may cite AICPA standards as well as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.


5.6
An audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> receiving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audit report may also
need a financial audit report for purposes other than to comply
with requirements calling for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audit. For example, the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> may need audited financial statements to issue bonds
or for other financing purposes. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audit is the basis
for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s subsequent report under the AICPA standards, it
would be advantageous to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the subsequent report for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">auditor</ENAMEX>'s report to include the information on compliance with laws
and regulations and internal control that is required by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> but
not required by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards. To reissue essentially the same
report omitting the information regarding compliance with laws and
regulations and internal control is not in the public
interest.


<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">REPORTING ON COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND ON</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING</ENAMEX>
5.7 An additional reporting standard for financial statement
audits2 conducted in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
When providing an opinion on financial statements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should include in their report on the financial statements either a
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) description of the scope of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' testing of compliance
with laws and regulations and internal control over financial
reporting and the results of those tests or an opinion, if
sufficient work was performed; or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) reference to the separate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>(s) containing that information. In presenting the results of
those tests, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report fraud, illegal acts, other
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material noncompliance</ENAMEX>, and reportable conditions in internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over financial reporting.


5.8
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may report on compliance with laws and
regulations and internal control over financial reporting in the
report on the financial statements or in separate report(s). When
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> report on compliance and internal control over financial
reporting as part of the report on the financial statements,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should include an introduction summarizing key findings in
the audit of the financial statements and the related compliance
and internal control work. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should not issue this
introduction as a stand-alone report.


5.9
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> report separately (including separate
reports bound in the same document) on compliance with laws and
regulations and internal control over financial reporting, the
report on the financial statements should state that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
are issuing those additional reports. The report on the financial
statements should also state that the reports on compliance with
laws and regulations and internal control over financial reporting
are an integral part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audit,


Although the following standard on reporting on compliance with
laws and regulations and on internal control over financial
reporting is applicable to audits of financial statements, the
requirement to report deficiencies in internal control (see
paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.11</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.15</NUMEX>) and reporting fraud, illegal acts,
and other noncompliance (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.16</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.26</NUMEX>) is
applicable to all financial audits.
and, in considering the results of the audit, these reports
should be read along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' report on the financial
statements.
Scope of Compliance and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control Work</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should report the scope of their testing of
compliance with laws and regulations and of internal control over
financial reporting, including whether or not the tests they
performed provided sufficient evidence to support an opinion on
compliance with laws and regulations or internal control over
financial reporting and whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are providing such
opinions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORTING DEFICIENCIES IN INTERNAL CONTROL</ENAMEX>
5.11 The additional reporting standard for financial audits
conducted in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should report significant deficiencies in internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> considered to be reportable conditions as defined in AICPA
standards.
5.12 The following are examples of matters that may be
reportable conditions:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
absence of appropriate segregation of duties consistent
with appropriate control objectives;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
absence of appropriate reviews and approvals of
transactions, accounting entries, or systems output;


3Auditors should follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s Statements on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attestation Engagements</ENAMEX> when providing opinions on internal control
over compliance with laws and regulations or on internal control
over financial reporting. See chapter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> for a discussion of the
attestation standards.
4AICPA standards define reportable conditions as significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control which
could adversely affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s ability to record, process,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summarize</ENAMEX>, and report financial data consistent with the assertions
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in the financial statements.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
inadequate provisions for the safeguarding of
assets;


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
evidence of failure to safeguard assets from loss,
damage, or misappropriation;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
evidence that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX> fails to provide complete and
accurate output consistent with the control objectives of the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> because of the misapplication of control
activities;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>
evidence of intentional override of internal control by
those in authority to the detriment of the overall objectives of
the system;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>
evidence of failure to perform tasks that are part of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control, such as reconciliations not prepared or not
timely prepared;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX>
absence of a sufficient level of control consciousness
within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>;


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">i.</ENAMEX>
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control that could result in violations of laws and
regulations having a direct and material effect on the financial
statements; and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j.</ENAMEX>
failure to follow up and correct previously identified
deficiencies in internal control.


5.13 In reporting on deficiencies in internal control, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should identify those that are individually or in the aggregate
considered to be material weaknesses<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should place their
findings in proper perspective by providing a description of the
objectives, scope, and methodology used to conduct the work. To
give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> a basis for judging the prevalence and
The AICPA standards define a material weakness as a reportable
condition in which the design or operation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> does not reduce to a relatively low
level the risk that misstatements caused by error or fraud in
amounts that would be material in relation to the financial
statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a
timely period by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in the normal course of performing their
assigned functions.
consequences of these findings, the instances identified should
be related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or the number of cases examined and be
quantified in terms of dollar value, if appropriate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may
include such information in their audit report or may prepare a
separate report. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> report separately, the audit report
should contain a reference to the separate report containing this
information6 and state that the separate report <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">is an integral part</ENAMEX>
of the audit and should be considered in assessing the results of
the audit.


5.14
To the extent possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should present findings
to identify the elements of criteria, condition, and effect, as
well as cause when problems are found. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
provide recommendations for corrective action if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are able
to sufficiently develop the findings. However, the elements needed
for a finding depend entirely on the scope and objectives of the
financial audit, and, as a result, may not always have all of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> fully developed. At a minimum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should identify
the condition, criteria, and possible effect to provide sufficient
information to federal, state, and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to assist them
in taking corrective action.


5.15
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> detect deficiencies in internal control
that are not reportable conditions, they should communicate those
deficiencies to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, preferably in
writing. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have communicated other deficiencies in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control in a management letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should refer to that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> letter when they
report on internal control. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should include in their audit
documentation evidence of all communications to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> about deficiencies in internal control.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORTING FRAUD, ILLEGAL ACTS</ENAMEX>, AND OTHER NONCOMPLIANCE
5.16 An additional reporting standard for financial audits
conducted in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
6For audits of financial statements, such information is
generally included in the reports on compliance and internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over financial reporting.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should report fraud, illegal acts, or other material
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noncompliance</ENAMEX>. In some circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report fraud
and illegal acts directly to parties external to the audited
entity.


5.17
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to address the
effect fraud or illegal acts may have on the audit report and to
determine that the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> or others with equivalent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> and responsibility are adequately informed about the
fraud or illegal acts. The additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> standard does not
modify these responsibilities. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards do not
require that this communication be written, nor do they address
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> regarding other noncompliance (violations of other
compliance requirements such as provisions of contracts or grant
agreements).


5.18
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> conclude, on the basis of evidence
obtained, that fraud or an illegal act either has occurred or is
likely to have occurred<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,7</NUMEX> they should report the relevant
information. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> need not report information about fraud or an
illegal act that is clearly inconsequential. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
include in their report the same information about fraud and
illegal acts that they have informed the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> about
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should also report other
noncompliance that is material to the audit.


5.19
In reporting material fraud, illegal acts, or other
noncompliance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should place their findings in proper
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> by providing a description of the objectives, scope,
and methodology used to conduct the work. To give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> a
basis for judging the prevalence and consequences of these
findings, the instances identified should be related to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or the number of cases examined and be quantified in
terms of dollar value, if appropriate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may include such
information in their audit report or may prepare a separate report.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> report separately, the audit report should contain a
reference to the separate report containing this


7Whether a particular act is, in fact, illegal may have to await
final determination by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of law or other adjudicative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
Thus, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> disclose matters that have led them to conclude
that an illegal act is likely to have occurred, they should not
imply that they have made a determination of illegality.
information8 and state that the report <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">is an integral part of</ENAMEX>
the audit and should be considered in assessing the results of the
audit.


5.20
To the extent possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should present findings
to identify the elements of criteria, condition, and effect, as
well as cause when problems are found. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
provide recommendations for corrective action if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are able
to sufficiently develop the findings. However, the elements needed
for a finding depend entirely on the scope and objectives of the
financial audit, and, as a result, may not always have all of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> fully developed. At a minimum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should identify
the condition, criteria, and possible effect to provide sufficient
information to federal, state, and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to assist them
in taking corrective action. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should also obtain the views
of responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> regarding the
findings and include this information in the report as
appropriate.


5.21
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> detect fraud, illegal acts, or other
noncompliance that do not meet criteria for reporting in paragraph
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.18</NUMEX>, they should communicate those findings to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, preferably in writing. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have
communicated those findings in a management letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of
the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should refer to that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> letter
when they report on compliance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may provide less extensive
disclosure of fraud and illegal acts that are not material in
either a quantitative or qualitative sense<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should
include in their audit documentation evidence of all communications
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> about fraud, illegal acts, and
other noncompliance.


Direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reporting of Fraud and Illegal Acts</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.22</NUMEX> GAGAS require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to report fraud or illegal acts
directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> outside the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> in two
circumstances, as discussed below. These requirements are in
addition to any legal
For audits of financial statements, such information is
generally included in the reports on compliance with laws and
regulations and internal control over financial reporting.
9Paragraphs 4.26 and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.27</NUMEX> provide guidance on factors that may
influence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' materiality judgments in audits of government
entities or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> receiving government assistance. AICPA
standards provide guidance on the interaction of quantitative and
qualitative considerations in materiality judgments.
requirements for direct reporting of fraud or illegal acts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should meet these requirements even if they have resigned
or been dismissed from the audit<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>


5.23
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> may be required by law or
regulation to report certain fraud or illegal acts to specified
external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, such as a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector general</ENAMEX> or a state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have communicated such fraud or
illegal acts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and they fail to
report them, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate such an awareness
to the governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of
the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> do not make the required report as soon as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">practicable</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' communication with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report the fraud or
illegal acts directly to the external party specified in the law or
regulation.


5.24
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> is responsible for
taking timely and appropriate steps to remedy fraud or illegal acts
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> report to it. When fraud or an illegal act involves
assistance received directly or indirectly from a government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may have a duty to report directly if management
fails to take remedial steps. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> conclude that such
failure is likely to cause them to depart from the standard report
on the financial statements or resign from the audit, then they
should communicate that conclusion to the governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. Then, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> do not
report the fraud or illegal act as soon as practicable to the
entity that provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> assistance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
report the fraud or illegal act directly to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.


5.25
In both of these situations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should obtain
sufficient, competent, and relevant evidence, such as confirmation
with outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, to corroborate assertions by management that
it has reported fraud or illegal acts. If they are unable to do so,
then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report the fraud or illegal acts directly
as discussed above.


5.26
Under some circumstances, laws, regulations, or policies
may require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to report promptly indications of certain
types of fraud or illegal acts to law enforcement or
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">investigatory</ENAMEX>

policy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> conclude that this type of fraud or
illegal act either has occurred or is likely to have occurred, they
should ask those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> and/or legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> if reporting
certain information about that fraud or illegal act would
compromise investigative or legal proceedings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should
limit their reporting to matters that would not compromise those
proceedings, such as information that is already a part of the
public record.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIEWS OF RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS</ENAMEX>
5.27 An additional reporting standard for financial audits
performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' report discloses significant deficiencies,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report the views of responsible officials
concerning the findings, conclusions, and recommendations, as well
as corrections planned.


5.28
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most effective ways to ensure that a report is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX>, complete, and objective is to obtain advance review and
comments by responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and others,
as may be appropriate. Including the views of responsible officials
produces a report that shows not only what was found and what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> think about it but also what the responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> think
about it and what they plan to do about it.


5.29
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should normally request that the responsible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>' views on significant findings, conclusions, and
recommendations be submitted in writing. Oral comments are
acceptable as well, and, in some cases, may be the only or most
expeditious way to obtain comments. Cases in which obtaining oral
comments can be effective include when there is a time-critical
need to meet a user's needs; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> has worked closely with
the responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> throughout the conduct of the work and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are very familiar with the findings and issues
addressed in the draft product; or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> does not expect
major disagreements with the draft report's findings, conclusions,
and recommendations, or perceive any major controversies with
regard to the issued discussed in the draft report. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should
prepare a


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
summary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>' oral comments and provide a copy of
the summary to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to verify that the
comments are accurately stated.


5.30
Comments should be fairly and objectively evaluated and
recognized, as appropriate, in the final report. Comments, such as
a promise or plan for corrective action, should be noted but should
not be accepted as justification for dropping a significant finding
or a related recommendation.


5.31
When the comments oppose the report's findings,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conclusions</ENAMEX>, or recommendations, and are not, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
opinion, valid, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should state their reasons for
disagreeing with the comments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' disagreement should be
stated in a fair and objective manner. Conversely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should modify their report as necessary if they find the comments
valid. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may wish to attach the comment letter to the audit
report to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> with both points of view.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</ENAMEX>
5.32 An additional reporting standard for financial audits
conducted in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
If certain pertinent information is prohibited from general
disclosure, the audit report should state the nature of the
information omitted and the requirement that makes the omission
necessary.
5.33 Certain information may be prohibited from general
disclosure by federal, state, or local laws or regulations. Such
information may be provided on a need-to-know basis in a separate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>-use report which is restricted to only persons
authorized by law or regulation to receive it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should,
when appropriate, consult with legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> regarding any
requirements or other circumstances that may necessitate the
omission of certain information.
5.34 Additional circumstances associated with public safety and
security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> could also justify the exclusion of certain
information in the report. For example, information related to
computer security for a particular program should be excluded from
publicly available reports because of the potential damage that
could be caused by the misuse of this information. In such
circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may issue a limited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>-use report
containing such information and distribute the report only to those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> responsible for acting on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' recommendations. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> make the judgment that certain additional information
should be excluded from a publicly available report, they should
state the nature of the information omitted and the reasons that
makes the omission necessary.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORT ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION</ENAMEX>
5.35 An additional reporting standard for financial audits
conducted in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should submit written audit reports to the appropriate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and to the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> requiring or arranging for the audits, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">external</ENAMEX> funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> such as legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, unless
legal restrictions prevent it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should also send copies of
the reports to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who have legal oversight authority
or who may be responsible for acting on audit findings and
recommendations and to others authorized to receive such reports.
Unless the report is restricted by law or regulation, or contains
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">privileged</ENAMEX> and confidential information, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should ensure
that copies be made available for public inspection.


5.36
Audit reports should be distributed in a timely manner to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> interested in the results<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.11</NUMEX> Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> include those
designated by law or regulation to receive such reports, those
responsible for acting on the findings and recommendations, those
of other levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that have provided assistance to the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>. However, if the subject of the
audit involves material that is classified for security purposes or
not releasable to particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> for other valid
reasons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may limit the report distribution.


5.37
When public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> are engaged, the engaging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> should ensure that the report is distributed
appropriately. If the public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> are to make the
distribution, the engagement agreement should indicate which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should receive the report.


5.38
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should follow their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s own
arrangements and statutory requirements for distribution. Usually,
they report to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, who are responsible for
distribution of the report. Further distribution of reports outside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should be made in accordance with applicable laws,
rules, regulations, or policy.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENGAGEMENTS</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>
6.1 In an attestation engagement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> issue an examination,
a review, or an agreed-upon procedures report on subject matter, or
on an assertion about the subject matter, that is the
responsibility of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. Attestation engagements can cover
a broad range of financial or nonfinancial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">objectives1</ENAMEX> and can be
part of a financial statement audit or other engagement.
Attestation engagements are governed by the standards for
attestation engagements issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Institute of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Certified Public Accountants</ENAMEX> (AICPA). Generally accepted government
auditing standards (GAGAS) incorporate for attestation engagements
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s general standard on criteria, its field work standards,
and its reporting standards, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA Statements</ENAMEX> on
Standards for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attestation Engagements</ENAMEX> (SSAEs), which interpret the
attestation standards, unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> excludes them by formal announcement<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.2</TIMEX> This chapter
identifies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s general standard on criteria, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> field work
standards, and reporting standards and prescribes additional field
work and reporting standards, as well as guidance, for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 See chapter 2</ENAMEX> for examples of objectives for attestation
engagements.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> To date, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> has not excluded any field
work standards, reporting standards, or statements on standards for
attestation engagements.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> GAGAS incorporate only one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s general standards
for attestation engagements. In addition to this general standard,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should follow the general standards for work performed
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, as discussed in chapter 3.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENGAGEMENTS</ENAMEX>
6.2 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s general standard related to criteria states the
following.
The practitioner [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>] shall perform an engagement only if
he or she has reason to believe that the subject matter is capable
of evaluation against criteria that are suitable and available to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.
6.3 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AICPA</ENAMEX> field work standards for attestation

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
The work shall be adequately planned and assistants, if
any, shall be properly supervised.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Sufficient evidence shall be obtained to provide a
reasonable basis for the conclusion that is expressed in the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADDITIONAL FIELD WORK STANDARDS FOR ATTESTATION ENGAGEMENTS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX> GAGAS require additional field work standards for
attestation engagements in the following areas:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
auditor communication (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.7</NUMEX>),


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.20</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.22</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auditor Communication</ENAMEX>
6.5 An additional field work standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate information to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and the individual contracting for the audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> regarding the nature and extent of planned testing and
reporting on the subject matter or assertion.
6.6 During the planning stages of an attestation engagement,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> requesting or contracting for the services
information regarding the nature and extent of testing and
reporting, including any potential restriction of reports
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the different levels of assurance services, to
reduce the risk that the needs or expectations of the parties
involved may be misinterpreted. For example, attestation standards
provide for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following three</TIMEX> levels of assurance.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Examination: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> perform sufficient testing to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> an opinion whether the subject matter is based on (or in

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respects</ENAMEX>, based on the criteria.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> perform sufficient testing to express a

assertion is not presented (or fairly stated) in all material
respects based on the criteria<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> As stated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>'s statements on standards for
attestation engagements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should not perform reviewlevel
work for reporting on internal control or compliance with laws and
regulations.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c. Agreed-upon</ENAMEX> procedures: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> perform testing to issue a
report of findings based on specific procedures performed on
subject matter.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should use their professional judgment to determine
the form and content of the communication, although written
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> is preferred. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may use an engagement letter,
if appropriate, to communicate the information. If the attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagement</ENAMEX> is part of a larger audit, this information may be
communicated as part of that audit. Whatever the form of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should include audit documentation
regarding the communication.
Considering the Results of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Previous Audits</ENAMEX> and Attestation
Engagements
6.8 An additional field work standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should consider the results of previous audits and
attestation engagements and follow up on known significant findings
and recommendations that directly relate to the subject matter of
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">attestation</TIMEX> engagement being undertaken.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should determine whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited
entity have taken appropriate corrective actions on known reported
significant findings and recommendations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> In addition to following
up on significant reported findings and recommendations from
previous financial audits or attestation engagements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should consider significant findings identified in performance
audits and other studies if these findings relate to subject matter
or assertions of the attestation engagement. For example, an audit
report on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s computerized information systems may contain
significant findings that could relate to the attestation
engagement if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> uses such systems to process information
about the subject matter or contained in an assertion about the
subject matter. Following up on known significant findings and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Significant findings and recommendations are those matters
that, if not corrected, could affect the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
work and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' conclusions about those results.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
recommendations identified in previous audits, attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX>, or studies can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> evaluate the subject
matter or the assertion associated with the attestation
engagement.
6.10 Providing continuing attention to significant findings and
recommendations is important to ensure the benefits of audit work
are realized. Ultimately, the benefits of audit work occur when
audit findings are resolved through meaningful and effective
corrective action in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings and
recommendations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> are
responsible for resolving audit findings and recommendations
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> to them and for having a process to track their status. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> do not have such a process,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may wish to establish their own process.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Documentation</ENAMEX>
6.11 The additional field work standard related to audit
documentation for attestation engagements performed in accordance
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
Audit documentation should contain sufficient information to
enable an experienced reviewer, who has had no previous connection
with the attestation engagement, to ascertain from the audit
documentation the evidence that supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' significant
judgments and conclusions. Audit documentation that supports
significant findings, conclusions, and recommendations should be
complete before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> issue their report.


6.12
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> require that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
prepare and maintain audit documentation. The form and content of
audit documentation should be designed to meet the circumstances of
the particular attestation engagement. The information contained in
audit documentation constitutes the principal record of the work
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have performed and the conclusions that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have reached. The quantity, type, and content of audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> is a matter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' professional
judgment.


6.13
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GAGAS</ENAMEX> extend the level of required audit documentation to
be sufficient for an experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewer</ENAMEX> who has had no previous
connection with the engagement to understand


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
the evidence that supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' significant judgments
and conclusions. Further, such documentation must be complete
before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> issue their report.


6.14
Attestation engagements done in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> are
subject to review by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and by oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> more
frequently than audits done in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards.
Thus, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards cite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main purposes of audit
documentation--providing the principal support for the audit report
and aiding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in the conduct and supervision of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audit</ENAMEX>--audit documentation serves an additional purpose in
attestation engagements performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. Audit
documentation allows for the review of audit quality by providing
the reviewer documentation, either in written or electronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formats</ENAMEX>, of the evidence supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' significant
judgments and conclusions.


6.15
Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should establish reasonable policies
and procedures for the safe custody and retention of audit
documentation for a time sufficient to satisfy legal and
administrative requirements. If audit documentation is only
retained electronically, the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should ensure that
the electronic documentation is capable of being accessed
throughout the specified retention period established for audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> and is safeguarded through sound computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>.


6.16
Audit documentation for attestation engagements under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should contain the following.




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
The objectives, scope, and methodology, including any
sampling criteria used.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Documentation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s determination that certain
additional government auditing standards do not apply or that an
applicable standard was not followed, the reasons therefore, and
the known effect that not following the standard had, or could
have, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the attestation</TIMEX> engagement.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Documentation of the work performed to support
significant judgments and conclusions, including descriptions of
transactions and records examined that would enable an experienced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reviewer</ENAMEX> to examine the same transactions and records<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
The consideration that the planned procedures are
designed to achieve objectives of the attestation engagement when
evidential matter obtained is highly dependent on computerized
information systems and is material to the objective of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagement</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are not relying on the effectiveness
of internal control over those computerized systems that produced
the information. The audit documentation should specifically
address (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the rationale for determining the nature, timing, and
extent of planned audit procedures; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> and competence of
available evidential matter produced outside a computerized
information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the effect on the attestation
engagement report if evidential matter to be gathered does not
afford a reasonable basis to achieve the objectives of the
engagement.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
Evidence of supervisory reviews of the work
performed.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.17 One</NUMEX> factor underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audits is that federal, state,
and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> cooperate in auditing
programs of common interest so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may use others' work
and avoid duplicate audit efforts. In addition, attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> are subject to
quality control and assurance reviews. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should make
arrangements to make audit documentation available, upon request,
in a timely manner to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>. Contractual
arrangements for attestation engagements performed in accordance
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> should provide for full and timely access to audit
documentation to facilitate reliance by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work, as well as reviews of audit quality control and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may meet this requirement by listing voucher numbers,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">check</ENAMEX> numbers, or other means of identifying specific documents
they examined. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are not required to include copies of
documents they examined as part of the audit documentation, nor are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> required to list detailed information from those
documents.

6.18 An additional field work standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
In planning examination-level attestation engagements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should obtain a sufficient understanding of internal control that
is material to the subject matter or assertion to plan the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagement</ENAMEX> and design procedures to achieve the objectives of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">attestation</TIMEX> engagement.
6.19 In planning the engagement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should obtain an
understanding of internal control7 as it relates to the subject
matter or assertion to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are attesting. The
subject matter or assertion may be of a financial or nonfinancial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nature</ENAMEX>, and internal control relevant to the subject matter or
assertion the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> is testing may relate to


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including the
use of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s resources;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
reliability of financial reporting, including reports on
budget execution and other reports for internal and external
use;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
safeguarding of assets.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Although not applicable to attestation engagements, the AICPA
statements on auditing standards may provide useful guidance
related to internal control for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> performing attestation
engagements in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
performing attestation engagements may wish to refer to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control guidance published by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee of Sponsoring</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations of the Treadway Commission</ENAMEX> (COSO). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> for

Fraud, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Illegal Acts</ENAMEX>, and Other Noncompliance
6.20 An additional field work standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
In planning examination-level attestation engagements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should design the engagement to provide reasonable assurance of
detecting fraud, illegal acts, or other noncompliance that could
have a material effect on the subject matter or assertion of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">attestation</TIMEX> engagement.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should exercise professional judgment in planning
the engagement by obtaining an understanding of the possible
effects of fraud, illegal acts, or other noncompliance on the

identifying and assessing any associated risks that could have a
material effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the attestation</TIMEX> engagement<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should

those risk factors identified, and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' response to those risk factors,
individually or in combination.


6.22 In addition, if during the performance of the attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagement</ENAMEX>, risk factors or other conditions are identified that
cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to believe that an additional response is
required, such factors or other conditions, and any future response

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA REPORTING STANDARDS FOR ATTESTATION ENGAGEMENTS</ENAMEX>
6.23 The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> standards for attestation engagements provide for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three</TIMEX> levels of reporting based on the type of assurance the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">auditor</ENAMEX> is providing. (See paragraph <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.6</NUMEX>.) The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX> reporting
standards for attestation engagements are as follows.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
The report shall identify the subject matter or the

engagement.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
The report shall state the practitioner's [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>']
conclusions about the subject matter or the assertion in relation
to the criteria against which the subject matter was
evaluated.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
The report shall state all of the practitioner's
[<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'] significant reservations about the engagement, the
subject matter, and, if applicable, the assertion related
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thereto</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
The report shall state that the use of the report is
restricted to specified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> under the following circumstances:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) When the criteria used to evaluate the subject matter are
determined by the practitioner to be appropriate only for a limited
number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> who either participated in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> or
can be presumed to have an adequate understanding of the criteria.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) When the criteria used to evaluate the subject matter are
available only to specified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) When reporting on subject

to apply agreed-upon procedures to the subject matter.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should, however, follow the report distribution

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADDITIONAL REPORTING STANDARDS FOR ATTESTATION ENGAGEMENTS</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.24</NUMEX> GAGAS require additional reporting standards for

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">a.</ENAMEX> reporting compliance with generally accepted government
auditing standards (see paragraphs
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.25</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.27</NUMEX>);

report issuance and distribution (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.39</NUMEX>
through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.43</NUMEX>).


Reporting Compliance With Generally Accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing</ENAMEX>
Standards
6.25 An additional reporting standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
Reports on attestation engagements should state that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagement</ENAMEX> was made in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards.
6.26 The above statement refers to all the applicable standards
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should have followed during the attestation
engagement. The statement should be qualified in situations where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> did not follow an applicable standard. In these
situations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should disclose in the scope section of
the report the applicable standard that was not followed, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
reasons therefore, and how not following the standard affected,
or could have affected, the results of the attestation
engagement.
6.27 When the report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the attestation</TIMEX> engagement is submitted
to comply with a legal, regulatory, or contractual requirement for
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audit, it should specifically cite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. An audited entity
receiving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> attestation report may also need a report on the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">attestation</TIMEX> engagement for purposes other than to comply with
requirements calling for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audit. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagement</ENAMEX> is the basis for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s subsequent report under
the AICPA standards, it would be advantageous to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the
subsequent report for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s report to include the
information on compliance with laws and regulations and internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> that is required by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> but not required by AICPA
standards. To reissue essentially the same report omitting the
information regarding compliance with laws and regulations and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control is not in the public interest.
Reporting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control</ENAMEX> and on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fraud</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Illegal Acts</ENAMEX>, and
Other Noncompliance
6.28 An additional reporting standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
The report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an attestation</TIMEX> engagement should disclose
deficiencies in internal control, including internal control over
compliance with laws and regulations, that are material to the
subject matter or assertion. Fraud, illegal acts, and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noncompliance</ENAMEX> often result from the lack, or circumvention, of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control. Accordingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should also disclose in the
report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the attestation</TIMEX> engagement instances of fraud, illegal
acts, or other noncompliance that are material to the subject
matter or the assertion.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should place their findings in proper perspective
by providing a description of the objectives, scope, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">methodology</ENAMEX> used to conduct the work. To give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> a basis
for judging the prevalence and consequences of these findings, the
instances identified should be related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or the
number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
value, if appropriate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> need not report information
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> fraud or an illegal act that is clearly inconsequential.
However, these matters should be brought to the attention of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.


6.30
To the extent possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should present findings
to identify the elements of criteria, condition, and effect, as
well as cause when problems are found. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
provide recommendations for corrective action if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are able
to sufficiently develop the findings. However, the elements needed
for a finding depend entirely on the scope and objectives of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">attestation</TIMEX> engagement, and, as a result, may not always have all
of the elements fully developed. At a minimum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
identify the condition, criteria, and possible effect to provide
sufficient information to federal, state, and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to
assist them in taking corrective action.


6.31
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> detect deficiencies in internal control
that are not material to the subject matter or assertion or
conclude, on the basis of evidence obtained, that fraud, an illegal
act, or other noncompliance either has occurred or is likely to
have occurred<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,10</NUMEX> they should communicate relevant information to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, preferably in writing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
should include in their audit documentation evidence of all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> about
deficiencies in internal control or indications of fraud, illegal
acts, or other noncompliance.


Views of Responsible Officials
6.32 An additional reporting standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
10 Whether a particular act is, in fact, illegal may have to
await final determination by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of law. Thus, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
disclose matters that have led them to conclude that an illegal act
is likely to have occurred, they should not imply that they have
made a determination of illegality.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>'s report discloses significant deficiencies,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report the views of responsible officials
concerning the findings, conclusions, and recommendations, as well
as corrections planned.


6.33
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most effective ways to ensure that a report is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX>, complete, and objective is to obtain advance review and
comments by responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and others,
as may be appropriate. Including the views of responsible officials
produces a report that shows not only what was found and what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> think about it but also what the responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> think
about it and what they plan to do about it.


6.34
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should normally request that the responsible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>' views on significant findings, conclusions, and
recommendations be submitted in writing. Oral comments are
acceptable as well, and, in some cases, may be the only or most
expeditious way to obtain comments. Cases in which obtaining oral
comments can be effective include when there is a time-critical
need to meet a user's needs; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have worked closely with
the responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> throughout the conduct of the work and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are very familiar with the findings and issues
addressed in the draft product; or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> does not expect
major disagreements with the draft report's findings, conclusions,
and recommendations, or perceive any major controversies with
regard to the issues discussed in the draft report. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should
prepare a summary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>' oral comments and provide a
copy of the summary to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to verify
that the comments are accurately stated.


6.35
Comments should be fairly and objectively evaluated and
recognized, as appropriate, in the final report. Comments, such as
a promise or plan for corrective action, should be noted but should
not be accepted as justification for dropping a significant finding
or a related recommendation.


6.36
When the comments oppose the report's findings,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conclusions</ENAMEX>, or recommendations, and are not, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
opinion, valid, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should state their reasons for
disagreeing with the comments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' disagreement should be
stated in a fair and objective manner. Conversely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should modify their report as necessary if they find the comments
valid.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may wish to attach the comment letter to the audit
report to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> with both points of view.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Privileged and Confidential Information</ENAMEX>
6.37 An additional reporting standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
If certain pertinent information is prohibited from general
disclosure, the report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the attestation</TIMEX> engagement should state
the nature of the information omitted and the requirement that
makes the omission necessary.
6.38 Certain information may be prohibited from general
disclosure by federal, state, or local laws or regulations. Such
information may be provided on a need-to-know basis only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
authorized by law or regulation to receive it. Additional
circumstances associated with public safety and security concerns
could also justify the exclusion of certain information in the
report. For example, information related to computer security for a
particular program should be excluded from the report because of
the potential damage that could be caused by the misuse of this
information. In such circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may issue a limited
official-use report containing such information and distribute the
report only to those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> responsible for acting on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' recommendations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report Issuance and Distribution</ENAMEX>
6.39 An additional reporting standard for attestation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engagements</ENAMEX> performed in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should submit written reports on the attestation
engagement to the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> and
to the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> requiring or
arranging for the engagement, including external funding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, unless legal restrictions prevent it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
should also send copies of the reports to other officials
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
who have legal oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> or who may be responsible for
acting on audit findings and recommendations and to others
authorized to receive such reports. Unless the report is restricted
by law or regulation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should ensure that copies be made
available for public inspection.


6.40
Reports should be distributed in a timely manner to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> interested in the results. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> include those
designated by law or regulation to receive such reports, those
responsible for acting on the findings and recommendations
contained in the report, those of other levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that
have provided assistance to the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>.


6.41
If the subject of the attestation engagement involves
material that is classified for security purposes or not releasable
to particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> for other valid reasons,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may limit the report distribution. Although AICPA
standards require that a report on an engagement to evaluate an
assertion that has been prepared on agreed-upon criteria or on an
engagement to apply agreed-upon procedures should contain a
statement limiting its use to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> who have agreed upon such
criteria or procedures, such a statement does not require that the
report distribution be limited.


6.42
When public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> are engaged, the engaging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> should ensure that the report is distributed
appropriately. If the public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountants</ENAMEX> are to make the
distribution, the engagement agreement should indicate which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should receive the report and other
steps being taken to ensure the availability of the report for
public inspection.


6.43
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should follow their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s own
arrangements and statutory requirements for distribution. Usually,
they report to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, who is responsible for
distribution of the report. Further distribution of reports outside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should be made in accordance with applicable laws,
rules, regulations, or policy.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CHAPTER 7</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIELD WORK STANDARDS</ENAMEX> FOR PERFORMANCE AUDITS
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>
7.1 This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> prescribes field work standards and provides
guidance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> conducting performance audits in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS). The
field work standards for performance audits relate to planning the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audit</ENAMEX>, supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, obtaining sufficient, competent, and
relevant evidence, and preparing audit documentation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLANNING</ENAMEX>
7.2 The field work standard related to planning for performance
audits conducted in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> is:
Work is to be adequately planned.


7.3
In planning the audit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should define the audit
objectives, as well as the scope, and methodology to achieve those
objectives. Audit objectives, scope, and methodologies are not
determined in isolation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> determine these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> elements of
the audit plan together, as the considerations in determining each
often overlap. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning</ENAMEX> is a continuous process throughout the
audit. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should consider the need to make
adjustments to the audit objectives, scope, and methodology as work
is being completed.


7.4
The objectives are what the audit is intended to
accomplish. They identify the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and performance
aspects to be included, as well as the potential finding and
reporting elements


that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> expect to develop<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit</ENAMEX> objectives can be
thought of as questions about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the program2</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> seek to
answer. (See chapter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.)


7.5
Scope is the boundary of the audit and should be directly
tied to the audit objectives. For example, the scope defines
parameters of the audit such as the period of time reviewed, the
availability of necessary documentation or records, and the number
of locations at which field work will be conducted.


7.6
The methodology comprises the work involved in gathering
and analyzing data to achieve the objectives. Audit procedures are
the specific steps and tests <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> will carry out to address the
audit objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should design the methodology to provide
sufficient, competent, and relevant evidence to achieve the
objectives of the audit. Methodology includes both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and
extent of audit procedures used to achieve the audit objectives.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may use different methodologies drawn from a wide variety
of disciplines<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>


7.7
Planning should be documented and should
include




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
considering the significance of various programs and the
needs of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the audit report (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8</NUMEX>
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.9</NUMEX>);


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
obtaining an understanding of the program to be audited
(see paragraph <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.10</NUMEX>);


1See discussion of the elements of a finding in paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.45</NUMEX>
through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.48</NUMEX>.
2This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> uses only the term program; however, the concepts
presented also apply to audits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, activities, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>.
3If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> chooses to apply or use standards or
methodologies developed by other professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> when
performing work under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GAGAS</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> should also apply the
standards in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> as appropriate. Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> do not
follow such other standards and methodologies, they may still serve
as a useful source of guidance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in planning their work
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GAGAS</ENAMEX>. However, if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> decide to perform their work in
accordance with the standards for attestation engagements issued by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AICPA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should apply the additional GAGAS standards for
attestation engagements contained in chapter 6.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">k.</ENAMEX>
documenting planning decisions (see paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.34</NUMEX>
through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.36</NUMEX>). Program Significance


7.8 The significance of a matter is its relative importance to
the audit objectives and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the audit report.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should consider the significance of a program or program
component and the potential use that will be made of the audit
results or report as they plan a performance audit. Indicators of
significance and/or use to consider include


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visibility</ENAMEX> and sensitivity of the program under
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audit</ENAMEX>,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
newness of the program or changes in its
conditions,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
role of the audit in providing information that can
improve public accountability and decisionmaking, and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
level and extent of review or other forms of independent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oversight</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.9 One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' report is government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who may have authorized or requested the audit. Another
important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' report is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> being audited,
which is responsible for acting on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' recommendations.
Other potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' report include government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> (other than those who may have authorized
or requested the audit), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. In addition to an interest in the program, potential
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> may have an ability to influence the conduct of the program.
An awareness of these potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' interests and influence can
help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> understand why the program operates the way it does.
This awareness can also help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors judge</ENAMEX> whether possible
findings could be significant to various possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.
Understanding the Program
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should obtain an understanding of the program to
be audited to help assess, among other matters, the significance of
possible audit objectives and the feasibility of achieving them.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' understanding may come from knowledge they already
have about the program or knowledge they gain from inquiries and
observations they make in planning the audit. The extent and
breadth of those inquiries and observations will vary among audits
based on the audit objectives, as will the need to understand
individual aspects of the program, such as the following.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Laws and regulations: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government</ENAMEX> programs usually are
created by law and are subject to more specific laws and
regulations than the private sector. For example, laws and
regulations usually set forth what is to be done, who is to do it,
the purpose to be achieved, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to be served, and how
much can be spent on what. Thus, understanding the laws and the
legislative history establishing a program can be essential to
understanding the program itself. Obtaining that understanding is
also a necessary step in identifying provisions of laws and
regulations significant to audit objectives.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Purpose and goals: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purpose</ENAMEX> is the result or effect that
is intended or desired from a program's operation. Legislatures
usually establish the program purpose when they provide authority
for the program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> may provide more detailed
guidance on program purpose to supplement the authorizing
legislation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> are sometimes asked to set goals for
program performance and operations, including both outcome and
output goals. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may use the stated program purpose and goals
as criteria for assessing program performance or may develop
additional criteria or best practices to compare the program
with.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control, often referred to as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> controls, in the broadest sense includes the plan of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, methods, and procedures adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to meet
its missions goals and objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control includes the
processes for planning, organizing, directing, and controlling
program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. It includes the systems for measuring,
reporting, and monitoring program performance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> control
also serves as the first line of defense in safeguarding assets and
preventing and detecting errors and fraud. Paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.11</NUMEX> through
7.16 contain guidance pertaining to internal control.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
Efforts: Efforts are the amount of resources (in terms of
money, material, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and so forth) that are put into a
program. These resources may come from within or outside the entity
operating the program. Measures of efforts can have a number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>, such as cost,


timing, and quality. Examples of measures
of efforts are dollars, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square feet</NUMEX> of building
space.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
Program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>: Program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are the
strategies, processes, and activities management uses to convert
efforts into outputs. Program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are subject to internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>
Outputs: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outputs</ENAMEX> represent the quantity of a good or
service produced by a program. For example, an output measure for a
job training program could be the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> completing
training, and an output measure for an aviation safety inspection
program could be the number of safety inspections
completed.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Outcomes</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outcomes</ENAMEX> are accomplishments or results of
programs. For example, an outcome measure for a job training
program could be the percentage of trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> obtaining a job
and still in the work place after a specified period of time.
Examples of outcome measures for an aviation safety inspection
program could be the percentage reduction in significant safety
problems found in subsequent inspections and/or the percentage of
significant problems deemed corrected in follow-up inspections.
Such outcome measures show progress in achieving the stated program
purposes of helping unemployable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> get and keep jobs and
improving the safety of aviation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should be
aware that outcomes may be influenced by cultural, economic,
physical, or technological factors outside the program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
may use approaches drawn from the field of program evaluation to
try to isolate the effects of the program from these other
influences.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should obtain an understanding of the internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> environment, as well as specific internal controls, that
are significant to the audit objectives, including internal control
over compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and
consider whether the internal controls have been placed in
operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> also need to consider whether any reliance will
be placed on internal controls in designing audit procedures. If
so, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should include
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
specific tests of the effectiveness of internal control and
consider the results in designing audit procedures<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> is
responsible for establishing effective internal control. The lack
of administrative continuity in government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> because of changes
in elected legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and in administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
increases the need for effective internal control.
7.12 The following classification of internal control is
intended to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> better understand internal controls and
determine their significance to the audit objectives.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Effectiveness and efficiency of program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>:
Controls over program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> include policies and procedures
that management has implemented to reasonably ensure that a program
meets its objectives and that unintended actions do not result,
such as improper payments. Understanding these controls can help
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> understand the program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> that convert efforts to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outputs</ENAMEX> or outcomes.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Validity and reliability of data: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Controls</ENAMEX> over the
validity and reliability of data include policies and procedures
that management has implemented to reasonably ensure that valid and
reliable data are obtained, maintained, and fairly disclosed in
reports. These controls help assure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> that it is getting
valid and reliable information about whether programs are operating
properly on an ongoing basis. Understanding these controls can help
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) assess the risk that the data gathered by the entity
may not be valid or reliable and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) design appropriate tests of
the data.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Compliance with applicable laws and regulations: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Controls</ENAMEX>
over compliance with applicable laws and regulations include
policies and procedures that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> has implemented to
reasonably ensure that program implementation is consistent with
laws and regulations.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
Refer to internal control guidance developed for the private
sector, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control - Integrated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX>, published by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee of Sponsoring Organizations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treadway Commission</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COSO</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</TIMEX>), which
incorporates the relevant guidance developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COSO</ENAMEX>, provides
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">definitions</ENAMEX> and fundamental concepts pertaining to internal control
at the federal level and may be useful to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> at any
level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control Management</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evaluation Tool</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1008G</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX>), based on the federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control standards, provides a systematic, organized, and
structured approach to assessing the internal control
structure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
93 Understanding the controls relevant to compliance with those
laws and regulations that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have determined are
significant can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> assess the risk of illegal acts.


7.13
A subset of these categories of internal control is the
safeguarding of resources. Controls over the safeguarding of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> include policies and procedures that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> has
implemented to reasonably prevent or promptly detect unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of resources.


7.14
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> can obtain an understanding of internal control
through inquiries, observations, inspection of documents and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, or review of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' reports. The procedures
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> perform to obtain an understanding of internal control
will vary among audits. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> factor influencing the extent of these
procedures is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' knowledge about internal control gained
in prior audits. Also, the need to understand internal control will
depend on the particular aspects of the program the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
consider in setting objectives, scope, and methodology. The
following are examples of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' understanding of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control can influence the audit plan.




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Audit objectives: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poorly</ENAMEX> controlled aspects of a program
have a higher risk of failure, so they may be more significant than
others in terms of where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> would want to focus their
efforts.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Audit scope: Knowledge of the internal control
environment and the status of controls in a certain location may
lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to target their efforts there.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Audit methodology: Effective controls over collecting,
summarizing, and reporting data may enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to limit the
extent of their direct testing of data validity and reliability. In
contrast, evidence suggesting ineffective controls may lead
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to perform more direct testing of the data, look for data
from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, or develop their own data.


7.15 When internal controls are significant to the audit

support their judgments about those controls<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> The following are
examples of circumstances where internal controls can be
significant to audit objectives.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
In determining the cause of unsatisfactory performance,
that unsatisfactory performance could result from weaknesses in
specific internal controls.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
When assessing the validity and reliability of
performance measures developed by the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control over collecting, summarizing, and reporting data
will help ensure valid and reliable performance
measures.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> auditing is an important part of internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>.6 When an assessment of internal control is called for, the
work of the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> can be used to help provide
reasonable assurance that internal controls are functioning
properly and to prevent duplication of effort.
Considering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal, Regulatory</ENAMEX>, and Other Compliance
Requirements
7.17 When laws, regulations, and other compliance requirements
such as provisions of contracts or grant agreements are significant
to the audit objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should design the audit to
provide reasonable assurance about compliance with them. This
requires determining which laws, regulations, and other compliance
requirements are significant to the audit objectives and assessing
the risk that significant noncompliance could occur<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX> Based on that
risk assessment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> design and perform procedures to
provide reasonable assurance of detecting

criteria <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> can use to support their judgments and
conclusions about internal control.

Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government entities</ENAMEX> have these activities identified by

significant instances of noncompliance. (See paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.59</NUMEX>
through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.63</NUMEX> for a discussion of evidence indicative of fraud,
illegal acts, or other noncompliance.)


7.18
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may find it necessary to work with legal counsel
to (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) determine those laws and regulations that are significant to
the audit objectives, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) design tests of compliance with laws and
regulations, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) evaluate the results of those tests. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
also may find it necessary to rely on the work of legal counsel
when audit objectives require testing compliance with provisions of
contracts or grant agreements<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> Depending on the circumstances of
the audit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may find it necessary to obtain information on
compliance matters from others, such as investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, other
audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> or government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that provided assistance
to the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, or the applicable law enforcement
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>.


7.19
It is not practical to set precise standards for
determining if laws, regulations, or other compliance requirements
are significant to audit objectives because government programs are
subject to many laws, regulations, and other compliance
requirements, and audit objectives vary widely. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
may find the following approach helpful in making that
determination.




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Reduce each audit objective to questions about specific
aspects of the program being audited (that is, purpose and goals,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control, efforts, program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, outputs, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>, as discussed in paragraph <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.10</NUMEX>).


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Identify laws, regulations, and other compliance
requirements that directly relate to specific aspects of the
program included in questions that reflect the audit
objectives.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Determine if violations of those laws, regulations, or
other compliance requirements could significantly affect the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' answers to the questions that relate to the audit
objectives. If they could, then those laws, regulations, and other
compliance requirements are likely to be significant to the audit
objectives.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
Paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.25</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.27</NUMEX> discuss relying on the work of
others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure</ENAMEX>
Draft
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">96 7.20</TIMEX> In planning tests of compliance with significant laws,
regulations, and other compliance requirements, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
assess the risk that noncompliance could occur. That risk may be
affected by such factors as the complexity of the laws and
regulations or their newness. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' assessment of risk
includes consideration of whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> has controls that are
effective in preventing or detecting noncompliance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> is
responsible for establishing effective controls to ensure
compliance with laws and regulations, as well as other compliance
requirements such as provisions of contracts or grant agreements.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> obtain sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of
these controls, they can reduce the extent of their tests of
compliance.
Criteria
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7.21 Criteria</ENAMEX> are the standards, measures, expectations of what
should exist, best practices, or benchmarks against which
performance is compared or evaluated. Criteria, one of the elements
of a finding, provide a context for understanding the results of
the audit. (See paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.45</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.48</NUMEX> for a discussion on
the other elements of a finding.) The audit plan, where possible,
should state the criteria to be used. In selecting criteria,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have a responsibility to use criteria that are reasonable,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attainable</ENAMEX>, and relevant to the objectives of the performance
audit. The following are some examples of possible criteria:


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
purpose or goals prescribed by law or regulation or set
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
policies and procedures established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
technically developed standards or norms,


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
expert opinions,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prior years</TIMEX>' performance,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>
performance of similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>
performance in the private sector, or


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX>
best practices of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.


Considering the Results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Previous Audits</ENAMEX>


7.22
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should consider the results of previous audits
and follow-up on known significant findings and recommendations9
that directly relate to the audit objectives of the performance
audit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should also be alert to the status of relevant
findings and recommendations identified in other available audits
and studies by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> as well. For example, an audit
report on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s computerized information systems may contain
significant findings that could relate to the audit if the entity
uses such systems to process its accounting or other information
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> plan on using. In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> need to make
judgments about the extent of follow-up needed and the appropriate
disclosure of uncorrected significant findings and recommendations
from prior audits that affect the audit objectives.


7.23
Providing continuing attention to significant findings
and recommendations is important to ensure that the benefits of
audit work are realized. Ultimately, the benefits of audit work
occur when audit findings are resolved through meaningful and
effective corrective action taken in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
findings and recommendations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> are
responsible for resolving audit findings and recommendations
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> to them and for having a process to track their status. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> do not have such a process,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may wish to establish their own process.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
Significant findings and recommendations are those matters that,
if not corrected, could affect the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' conclusions about those results.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">98 Identifying Sources of Audit Evidence</ENAMEX>
7.24 In identifying potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of data that could be used
as audit evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should consider the validity and
reliability of these data, including data collected by the audited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>, data generated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, or data provided by third
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, as well as the sufficiency and relevance of the evidence.
(See paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.41</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.44</NUMEX> for guidance concerning
evidence.)
Considering Work of Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>


7.25
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should determine if other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have
previously done, or are doing, audits of the program or the entity
that operates it. Whether other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have done performance
audits, financial audits, or attestation engagements, the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may be useful sources of information for planning and
performing the audit. If other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have identified areas that
warrant further study, their work may influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
selection of objectives. The availability of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work
may also influence the selection of methodology, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
may be able to rely on that work to limit the extent of their own
testing.


7.26
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> intend to rely on the work of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>,
they should perform procedures regarding the specific work to be
relied on that provide a sufficient basis for that reliance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> can obtain evidence concerning the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
qualifications10 and independence through prior experience,
inquiry, and/or review of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' external quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> review report. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> can determine the sufficiency,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relevance</ENAMEX>, and competence of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' evidence by reviewing
their report, audit program, or audit documentation, or by
performing supplemental tests of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work. The
nature and extent of evidence needed will depend on the
significance of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work and on the extent to which
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> will rely on that work.


10
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> from another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> engaged to conduct audits in their
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> should meet the professional qualifications to practice
under that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s laws and regulations or other acceptable
standards, such as those issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Organization</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Audit Institutions</ENAMEX>. Also see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation of Accountants' International Standards on Auditing</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 7.27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> face similar considerations when using the work
of nonauditors (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>, and so forth).
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should obtain an understanding of the methods
and significant assumptions used by the nonauditors. (See paragraph
3.xx for independence considerations when relying on the work of
others.)
Staff and Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resources</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.28</NUMEX> Staff planning should include, among other things,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assigning</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with the appropriate collective
knowledge, skills, and experience for the job,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
assigning an adequate number of staff and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> to
the audit,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
providing for on-the-job training of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> when necessary.




7.29
The availability of staff and other resources and the
need for specialized skills are important considerations in
establishing the objectives, scope, and methodology. For example,
limitations on travel funds may preclude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> from visiting
certain critical locations, or lack of expertise in a particular
methodology or with computerized information systems may preclude
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> from undertaking certain objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may be able
to overcome such limitations by using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> from any existing local
field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> or by engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> with
the necessary expertise.


7.30
If the use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> is planned, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
have sufficient knowledge to




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
articulate the objectives required of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
evaluate whether the specified procedures will meet
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' objectives, and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
evaluate the results of the procedures applied as they
relate to other planned audit procedures.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> without sufficient knowledge to perform the
functions listed above may have to engage a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> for quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> purposes for the areas related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>'s
work.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Communicating With Management and Others</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate information about the specific
nature of the audit, as well as general information concerning the
planning and conduct of the performance audit, to the various
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> involved in the audit to help them understand the
objectives, time frames, and any data needs. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> may
include


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> or, in the absence of an audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> or other equivalent oversight
body;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> who possesses a sufficient level of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> and responsibility for the program or activity being
audited; and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> contracting for or requesting audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, such as contracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> or legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> or
staff, if applicable.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should use their professional judgment to
determine the form, content, and frequency of the communication,
although written communication is preferred, and should document
the communication. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may use an engagement letter, if
appropriate, to communicate the information.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Documenting Planning Decisions</ENAMEX>


7.34
A written audit plan should be prepared for each audit.
The form and content of the written audit plan will vary among
audits but should include an audit program or project plan, a
memorandum, or other appropriate documentation of key decisions
about the audit objectives, scope, and methodology and of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' basis for those decisions. It should be updated, as
necessary, to reflect any significant changes to the plan made
during the audit.


7.35
Documenting the audit plan is an opportunity for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to review the work done in planning the audit to determine
whether




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
the proposed audit objectives are likely to result in a
useful report,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
the proposed audit scope and methodology are adequate to
satisfy the audit objectives, and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and other resources are available to
perform the audit and to meet expected time frames for completing
the work.


7.36 Written audit plans may include the following.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Information about the legal authority for the audited
program, its history and current objectives, its principal
locations, and other background that can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> understand
and carry out the audit plan.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Information about the responsibilities of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> (such as preparing audit programs, conducting audit
work, supervising and reviewing audit work, drafting reports,
handling comments from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited program, and
processing the final report), which can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> when the work
is conducted at several different locations. In these audits, use
of comparable audit methods and procedures can help make the data
obtained from participating locations comparable.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Audit programs describing procedures to accomplish the
audit objectives and providing a systematic basis for assigning
work to staff and for summarizing the work performed.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
The general format of the audit report and the types of
information to be included, which can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> focus their
field work on the information to be reported.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SUPERVISION</ENAMEX>
7.37 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> field work standard for performance audits
is:
Staff are to be properly supervised.


7.38
Supervision involves directing the efforts of staff
assigned to the audit to ensure that the audit objectives are
accomplished. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elements</ENAMEX> of supervision include providing sufficient
guidance to staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, keeping informed of significant problems
encountered, reviewing the work performed, and providing effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">on-the-job</ENAMEX> training.


7.39
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supervisors</ENAMEX> should satisfy themselves that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> members
clearly understand what work they are to do, why the work is to be
conducted, and what the work is expected to accomplish. With
experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> may outline the scope of the work
and leave details to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. With a less experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervisors</ENAMEX> may have to specify audit procedures to be performed as
well as techniques for gathering and analyzing data.


7.40
The nature of the review of audit work may vary depending
on the significance of the work or the experience of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. For
example, it may be appropriate to have experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> review
much of the work of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with similar experience.


EVIDENCE
7.41 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> field work standard for performance audits
is:
Sufficient, competent, and relevant evidence is to be obtained
to afford a reasonable basis for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings and
conclusions.


7.42
A large part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work on an audit concerns
obtaining and evaluating evidence that ultimately supports their
judgments and conclusions pertaining to the audit objectives. In
evaluating evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> consider whether they have obtained
the evidence necessary to achieve specific audit objectives. When
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control or compliance requirements are significant to the
audit objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should also collect and evaluate
evidence relating to controls or compliance.


7.43
Evidence may be categorized as physical, documentary,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">testimonial</ENAMEX>, and analytical. Physical evidence is obtained by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' direct inspection or observation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, property, or
events. Such evidence may be documented in memoranda, photographs,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drawings</ENAMEX>, charts, maps, or physical samples. Documentary evidence
consists of created information such as letters, contracts,
accounting records, invoices, and management information on
performance. Testimonial evidence is obtained through inquiries,
interviews, or questionnaires. Analytical evidence includes
computations, comparisons, separation of information into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>, and rational arguments.


7.44
The guidance in the following paragraphs is intended to
help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors judge</ENAMEX> the quality and quantity of evidence needed to
satisfy audit objectives. Paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.45</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.48</NUMEX> describe the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of an audit finding. Paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.49</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.58</NUMEX> provide
guidance to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> determine what constitutes sufficient,
competent, and relevant evidence to support their findings and
conclusions.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit Findings</ENAMEX>


7.45
Audit findings often have been regarded as containing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of criteria, condition, and effect, plus cause when
problems are found. However, the elements needed for a finding
depend entirely on the objectives of the audit. Thus, a finding or
set of findings is complete to the extent that the audit objectives
are satisfied and the report clearly relates those objectives to
the finding's elements. Criteria are discussed in paragraph <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.21</NUMEX>,
and the other elements of a finding--condition, effect, and
cause--are discussed in the following paragraphs.


7.46
Condition: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Condition</ENAMEX> is a situation that exists. It has
been determined and documented during the audit.


7.47
Effect: Effect has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meanings, which depend on the
audit objectives. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' objectives include identifying
the actual or potential consequences of a condition that varies
(either positively or negatively) from the criteria identified in
the audit, "effect" is a measure of those consequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
often use effect in this sense to demonstrate the need for
corrective action in response to identified problems. When the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' objectives include estimating the extent to which a
program has caused changes in physical, social, or economic
conditions, "effect" is a measure of the impact achieved by the
program. Here, effect is the extent to which positive or negative
changes in actual physical, social, or economic conditions can be
identified and attributed to program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.


7.48
Cause: Like effect, cause also has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meanings, which
depend on the audit objectives. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' objectives
include explaining why a particular type of positive or negative
performance identified in the audit occurred, the reasons for that
performance are referred to as "cause." Identifying the cause of
problems can assist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in making constructive recommendations
for correction. Because problems can result from a number of
plausible factors or multiple causes, the recommendation can be
more persuasive if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> can clearly demonstrate and explain
with evidence and reasoning the link between the problems and the
factor or factors they identified as the underlying cause. When the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' objectives include


estimating the program's effect on changes
in physical, social, or economic conditions, they seek evidence of
the extent to which the program itself is the "cause" of those
changes.
Tests of Evidence
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7.49 Evidence</ENAMEX> should be sufficient, competent, and relevant to
support a sound basis for audit findings, conclusions, and
recommendations.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Evidence should be sufficient to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
findings. In determining the sufficiency of evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should ensure that enough evidence exists to persuade a
knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of the validity of the findings. When
appropriate, statistical methods may be used to establish
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sufficiency</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Evidence is competent if it is consistent with fact (that
is, evidence is competent if it is valid and reliable). In
assessing the competence of evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should consider such
factors as whether the evidence is accurate, authoritative, timely,
and authentic. When appropriate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may use statistical
methods to derive competent evidence.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Evidence is relevant if it has a logical, sensible
relationship to the issue being addressed.


7.50 The following presumptions are useful in judging the
competence of evidence. However, these presumptions are not to be
considered sufficient in themselves to determine competence. The
amount and kinds of evidence required to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
conclusions should be based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' professional judgment.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Evidence obtained when internal controls are effective is
more competent than evidence obtained when controls are weak or
nonexistent. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should therefore be particularly careful in
cases where controls are weak or nonexistent.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Evidence obtained through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' direct physical
examination, observation, computation, and inspection is more
competent than evidence obtained indirectly.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Original documents provide more competent evidence than
do copies.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
Testimonial evidence obtained under conditions where
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> may speak freely is more competent than testimonial
evidence obtained under compromising conditions (for example, where
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> may be intimidated).


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
Testimonial evidence obtained from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> who is
not biased or has complete knowledge about the area is more
competent than testimonial evidence obtained from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> who
is biased or has only partial knowledge about the area.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>
Evidence obtained from a credible <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> may in some
cases be more competent than that secured from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.




7.51
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may find it useful to obtain written
representations concerning the competence of certain evidence from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. Written representations ordinarily
confirm oral representations given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, indicate and
document the continuing appropriateness of such representations,
and reduce the possibility of misunderstanding concerning the
matters that are the subject of the representations. Written
representations can take several forms, including having entity
management sign summary documents prepared by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>.


7.52
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' approach to determining the sufficiency,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">competence</ENAMEX>, and relevance of evidence depends on the source of the
information that constitutes the evidence. Information sources
include original data gathered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and existing data
gathered by either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> or a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from any of
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> may be obtained from computer-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>.


7.53
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> gathered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> gathered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' own observations and measurements. Among the
methods for gathering this type of data are questionnaires,
structured interviews, direct observations, and computations. The
design of these methods and the skill of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> applying them
are the keys to ensuring that these data constitute sufficient,
competent, and relevant evidence. When these methods are applied to
determine cause, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are concerned with eliminating rival
explanations.


7.54
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> gathered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> can use data
gathered by management as part of their evidence. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should determine the validity and reliability of these data that
are significant to the audit objectives and may do so by direct
tests of the data. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> can reduce the direct tests of the data
if they test the effectiveness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s internal controls
over the validity and reliability of the data, and these tests
support the conclusion that the controls are effective. The nature
and extent of testing of the data will depend on the significance
of the data to support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings.


7.55
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> gathered by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' evidence
may also include data gathered by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. In some cases,
these data may have been audited by others, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may be
able to audit the data themselves. In other cases, however, it will
not be practical to obtain evidence of the data's validity and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX>. How the use of unaudited third-party data affects the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' report depends on the data's significance to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings. For example, in some circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
may use unaudited data to provide background information; however,
the use of such unaudited data would generally not be appropriate
to support audit findings and conclusions.


7.56
Validity and reliability of data from computer-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should obtain sufficient, competent, and relevant
evidence that computer-processed data are valid and reliable when
those data are significant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings. This work is
necessary regardless of whether the data are provided to auditors
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> independently extract them<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>


11
When computer-processed data are used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX>, or
included in the report, for background or informational purposes
and are not significant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings, citing the
source of the data and stating that they were not verified will
satisfy the reporting standards for accuracy and completeness set
forth in this statement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">108</ENAMEX> should determine if other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have worked to establish
the validity and reliability of the data or the effectiveness of
the controls over the system that produced the data. If the results
of such work is current, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may be able to rely on that work.
(See paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.25</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.27</NUMEX> for requirements when relying on
the work of others.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may also determine the validity and
reliability of computer-processed data by direct tests of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> can reduce the direct tests of the data if they
test the effectiveness of general and application controls over
computer-processed data, and these tests support the conclusion
that the controls are effective. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> determine that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> controls over data which are significantly dependent upon
computerized information systems are not effective or if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
do not plan to test the effectiveness of such controls, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should include audit documentation regarding the basis for that
conclusion by addressing (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the reasons why the design or
operation of the controls is ineffective, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the reasons why it
is inefficient to test the controls. In such circumstances,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should also include audit documentation regarding their
reasons for concluding that the planned audit procedures are
effectively designed to achieve specific audit objectives. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> should address


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
the rationale for determining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and extent of
planned audit procedures;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> and competence of available evidence produced
outside a computerized information system; and


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
the effect on the audit report if the evidence gathered
during the audit does not allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to achieve audit
objectives.


7.58 When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' tests of data disclose errors in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, or when they are unable to obtain sufficient, competent, and
relevant evidence about the validity and reliability of the data,
they may find it necessary to


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
seek evidence from other sources,


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
redefine the audit's objectives to eliminate the need to
use the data, or


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
use the data, but clearly indicate in their report the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>'s limitations and refrain from making unwarranted conclusions
or recommendations.


Evidence <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Indicative of Fraud, Illegal Acts, Or Other</ENAMEX>
Noncompliance


7.59
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should be alert to situations or transactions
that could be indicative of fraud, illegal acts (violations of laws
and regulations), or other noncompliance (violations of other
compliance requirements such as provisions of contracts or grant
agreements). When information comes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' attention
(through audit procedures, allegations received through fraud
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hotlines</ENAMEX>, or other means) indicating that fraud, illegal acts, or
other noncompliance may have occurred, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should consider
whether the possible fraud, illegal acts, or other noncompliance
could significantly affect the audit results. If they could, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should extend the audit steps and procedures, as
necessary, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to determine if fraud, illegal acts, or other
noncompliance are likely to have occurred and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) if so, to
determine their effect on the audit results.


7.60
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>' training, experience, and understanding of the
program being audited may provide a basis for recognizing that some
acts coming to their attention may be indicative of fraud, illegal
acts, or other noncompliance. Whether an act is, in fact, illegal
is a determination to be made through the judicial or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjudicative</ENAMEX> system and is beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' professional expertise
and responsibility. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible for being
aware of vulnerabilities to fraud, illegal acts, or other
noncompliance associated with the area being audited in order to be
able to identify indications that fraud, illegal acts, or other
noncompliance may have occurred. In some circumstances, conditions
such as the following might indicate a heightened risk of fraud,
illegal acts, or other noncompliance:




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
weak management which fails to enforce existing internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> or to provide adequate oversight over the control
process;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
inadequate separation of duties, especially those that
relate to controlling and safeguarding resources;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
transactions that are out of the ordinary and are not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">satisfactorily</ENAMEX> explained, such as unexplained adjustments in
inventories or other resources;


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
instances when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> refuse to
take vacations or accept promotions;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>
missing or altered documents, or unexplained delays in
providing information;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">f.</ENAMEX>
false or misleading information; or


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">g.</ENAMEX>
history of impropriety, such as past audits or
investigations with findings of questionable or criminal
activity.




7.61
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should exercise professional judgment in
pursuing indications of possible fraud, illegal acts, or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noncompliance</ENAMEX> so as not to interfere with potential investigations,
legal proceedings, or both. Under some circumstances, laws,
regulations, or policies require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to report indications of
certain types of illegal acts to law enforcement or investigatory
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> before extending audit steps and procedures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
may also be required to withdraw from or defer further work on the
audit or a portion of the audit in order not to interfere with an
investigation.


7.62
An audit made in accordance with these standards provides
reasonable assurance of detecting fraud, illegal acts, or other
noncompliance that could significantly affect the audit results; it
does not guarantee the discovery of fraud, illegal acts, or other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noncompliance</ENAMEX>. Nor


does the subsequent discovery of such acts committed during the
audit period necessarily mean that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' performance was
inadequate, provided the audit was made in accordance with these
standards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7.63 Abuse</ENAMEX> is distinct from illegal acts and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noncompliance</ENAMEX>. When abuse occurs, no law, regulation, contract
provision, or grant agreement is violated. Rather, the conduct of a
government program falls far short of societal expectations for
prudent program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should be alert to situations
or transactions that could be indicative of abuse. When information
comes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' attention (through audit procedures,
allegations received through a fraud hotline, or other means)
indicating that abuse may have occurred, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should consider
whether the possible abuse could significantly affect the audit
results. If it could, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should extend the audit steps
and procedures, as necessary, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to determine if the abuse
occurred and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) if so, to determine its effect on the audit
results. However, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of abuse is so
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subjective</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are not expected to provide reasonable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assurance</ENAMEX> of detecting it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUDIT DOCUMENTATION</ENAMEX>
7.64 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> field work standard for performance audits
is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should prepare and maintain audit documentation. Audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> should contain sufficient information to enable an
experienced reviewer, who has had no previous connection with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audit</ENAMEX>, to ascertain from the audit documentation the evidence that
supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' significant judgments and conclusions. Audit
documentation that supports significant findings, conclusions, and
recommendations should be complete before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> issue their
report.
7.65 The form and content of audit documentation should be
designed to meet the circumstances of the particular audit. The
information contained in audit documentation constitutes the
principal record of the work that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have performed and
the conclusions that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have reached. The quantity, type,
and content of audit documentation is a matter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
professional judgment.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit</ENAMEX> documentation serves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main purposes: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to
provide the principal support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' report, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to aid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in conducting and supervising the audit, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) to allow
for the review of audit quality. This <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> purpose is important
because audits done in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> often are subject to
review by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and by oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.
Audit documentation allows for the review of audit quality by
providing the reviewer documentation, either in written or
electronic formats, of the evidence supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
significant judgments and conclusions.


7.67
Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should establish reasonable policies
and procedures for the safe custody and retention of audit
documentation for a time sufficient to satisfy legal and
administrative requirements. If audit documentation is only
retained electronically, the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should ensure that
the electronic documentation is capable of being accessed
throughout the specified retention period established for audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> and is safeguarded through sound computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>.


7.68
Audit documentation should contain




<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
the objectives, scope, and methodology, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> and other selection criteria used;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
documentation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' determination that certain
standards do not apply or that an applicable standard was not
followed, the reasons therefore, and the known effect that not
following the standard had, or could have, on the audit;


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
documentation of the work performed to support
significant judgments and conclusions, including descriptions of
transactions and records examined that would enable an experienced
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reviewer</ENAMEX> to examine the same transactions and records;<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
evidence of supervisory review of the work
performed.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7.69 Underlying GAGAS</ENAMEX> audits is that federal, state, and local
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> cooperate in auditing programs
of common interest so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may use others' work and
avoid duplicate audit efforts. In addition, audits performed in
accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> are subject to quality control and assurance
reviews. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should make arrangements to make audit
documentation available, upon request, in a timely manner to other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>. Contractual arrangements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> audits
should provide for full and timely access to audit documentation to
facilitate reliance by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' work, as
well as reviews of audit quality control and assurance.
12
The nature of this documentation will vary with the nature of
the work performed. For example, when this work includes
examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s records, the audit documentation should
describe those records so that an experienced reviewer would be
able to examine those same records. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may meet this
requirement by listing file numbers, case numbers, or other means
of identifying specific documents they examined. They are not
required to include in the audit documentation copies of documents
they examined, nor are they required to list detailed information
from those documents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CHAPTER 8</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORTING STANDARDS</ENAMEX> FOR PERFORMANCE AUDITS
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>
8.1 This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> prescribes reporting standards and provides
guidance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> reporting on performance audits in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS). The
reporting standards for performance audits relate to the form of
the report, the report contents, report quality, and report
issuance and distribution.
FORM
8.2 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> reporting standard for performance audits is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should prepare audit reports communicating the results
of each audit.


8.3
The form of the audit report should be appropriate for
its intended use. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should use their professional judgment
including consideration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' needs, likely demand, and
distribution in determining the form of the audit report. In
addition to a more formal presentation of audit results, such as a
chapter report or a letter report, briefing slides may be
considered audit reports. Audit reports also may be presented on
electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> that are retrievable by report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and the audit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, such as video or compact disk formats. However, to
comply with these standards, audit reports, regardless of form,
should comply with all applicable reporting standards.


8.4
This standard is not intended to limit or prevent
discussion of findings, judgments, conclusions, and recommendations
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who have responsibilities involving the area being
audited. On the contrary, such discussions are
encouraged.


8.5
Audit reports (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) communicate the results of audits to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at various levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>,


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) make the results less susceptible to misunderstanding, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
make the results available for public inspection, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>)
facilitate follow-up to determine whether appropriate corrective
actions have been taken. The need to maintain public accountability
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> program demands that audit reports be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrievable</ENAMEX>.
8.6 When an audit is terminated before it is completed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should communicate that fact to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> requesting the audit, and other appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>,
preferably in writing. In the absence of an audit report, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
should also write a memorandum for the record that summarizes the
results of the work to the date of termination and explains why the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audit</ENAMEX> was terminated.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORT CONTENTS</ENAMEX>
8.7 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reporting standard for performance audits is:
The audit report should include the objectives, scope, and
methodology; the audit results, including findings, conclusions,
and recommendations, as appropriate; a reference to compliance with
generally accepted government auditing standards; the views of
responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>; and, if applicable, the nature of any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">privileged</ENAMEX> and confidential information omitted.
Objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should include in the report the audit objectives
and the scope and methodology used for achieving the audit
objectives. This information is needed by report users to
understand the purpose of the audit and the nature of the audit
work performed, to provide perspective as to what is reported, and
to understand any significant limitations in audit objectives,
scope, or methodology. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should also report the status of
uncorrected significant findings and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">recommendations1</ENAMEX> from prior
audits that affect the objectives of the current audit.
Objectives
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audit</ENAMEX> objectives should be communicated to knowledgeable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> by reporting the questions that were to be answered in the
audit in a clear, specific, and neutral manner that avoids unstated
assumptions. In reporting the audit objectives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
explain why the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> undertook the assignment and
state what the report is to accomplish, and why the subject matter
is important. Articulating what the report is to accomplish
normally involves identifying the audit subject and the aspect of
performance examined. The reported audit objectives provide more
meaningful information to report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> if they are measurable and
feasible and avoid being presented in a broad or general manner. To
reduce misunderstanding in cases where the objectives are
particularly limited and broader objectives can be inferred, it may
be necessary to state objectives that were not pursued.
Scope and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
8.10 In reporting the scope of the audit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
describe the depth and coverage of work conducted to accomplish the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audit</ENAMEX>'s objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should, as applicable, explain the
relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of items sampled and what was
audited; identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, geographic locations, and the
period covered; report the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of evidence; and
explain
1Significant findings and recommendations are those matters,
that if not corrected, could affect the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
work and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' conclusions about those results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
any problems with the evidence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should also report
significant constraints imposed on the audit approach by data
limitations or scope impairments.


8.11
To report the methodology used, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should clearly
explain how the audit objectives were accomplished including the
evidence gathering and analysis techniques used in sufficient
detail to allow knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of their reports to understand
the work. This explanation should identify any significant
assumptions made in conducting the audit; describe any comparative
techniques applied; describe the criteria used; and when sampling
significantly supports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings, describe the sample
design and state why it was chosen, including whether the results
can be projected to the intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.


8.12
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should attempt to avoid misunderstanding by the
report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> concerning the work that was and was not done to
achieve the audit objectives, particularly when the work was
limited because of constraints on time or resources. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> should clearly describe the scope of the work performed and
any limitations, the applicable standards that were not followed,
and the reasons therefore, and how not following the applicable
standards affected or could affect the results of the work. For
example, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> are unable to determine the reliability of
information from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s database, and information from this
database is critical to the audit findings, the report should
clearly state the limitations associated with the information and
refrain from making unwarranted conclusions or recommendations. In
these situations, the audit report should also include the reasons
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> were unable to perform this work and the potential
impact on the findings if the information is not
reliable.


Audit Results
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should report significant findings by providing
credible and convincing evidence that relates to the audit
objectives. An audit report is improved when it provides sufficient
contextual sophistication to reflect an understanding of the issues
and an awareness of the external environment, including sensitivity
to relevant trends. The report should provide selective background
information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
to provide the context for the overall message and to help the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> understand the significance of the issues discussed<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> should also include all significant instances of fraud,
illegal acts, or other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noncompliance3</ENAMEX> and all significant instances
of abuse that were found during or in connection with the audit and
any significant weaknesses in internal control found during the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">audit</ENAMEX>, and where applicable, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' conclusions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
Findings


8.14
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should report the significant findings developed
in response to each audit objective. These findings should be
supported by sufficient, competent, and relevant evidence. They
also should be presented in a manner to promote adequate
understanding of the matters reported and to provide convincing but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX> presentations in proper perspective.


8.15
As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 7</ENAMEX>, findings often have been
regarded as containing the elements of criteria, condition, cause,
and effect. However, the elements needed for a finding depend on
the audit objectives. Thus, a finding or set of findings is
complete to the extent that the audit objectives are satisfied and
the report clearly relates those objectives to the elements of the
finding.


8.16
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should develop the elements of a finding in the
audit report, as appropriate to satisfy the audit objectives. In
reporting on elements of findings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may find it useful to
consider the following guidance on each finding element.


2Appropriate background information may include information on
how programs/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> work, the significance of
programs/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> (i.e., dollars, impact, purposes, and past
audit work if relevant), a description of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s
responsibilities, and explanation of terms, organizational
structure, and statutory basis for the program/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
3Whether a particular act is, in fact, illegal may have to await
final determination by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of law. Thus, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> disclose
matters that have led them to conclude that an illegal act is
likely to have occurred, they should take care not to imply that
they have made a determination of illegality. See paragraph <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.17</NUMEX>
for additional reporting considerations.
Significant weaknesses in internal controls may be discussed in
the report as an element of a finding. Many times these weaknesses
will be described as the cause of the finding or in "a process
finding" will be the condition element. Paragraphs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.46</NUMEX> through
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.49</NUMEX> describe the elements of a finding.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX>
Criteria: An audit report is improved when it provides
information so that the report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> will be able to determine what
is the required or desired state or what is expected from the
program or operation. The criteria are easier to understand when
stated fairly, explicitly, and completely, and the source of the
criteria are identified in the audit report<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.</ENAMEX>
Condition: The audit report is improved when it provides
evidence of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> found regarding the actual situation.
Reporting the scope or extent of the condition allows the report
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> to gain an accurate perspective.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX>
Cause: The audit report is improved when it provides
convincing evidence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> or factors responsible for the
difference between condition and criteria. In reporting the cause,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may consider whether the evidence provides a reasonable
and persuasive argument for why the stated cause is the key factor
or factors contributing to the difference as opposed to other
possible causes, such as poorly designed criteria or factors
uncontrollable by program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> also may
consider whether the identified cause serves as a basis for the
recommendations.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d.</ENAMEX>
Effect: The audit report is improved when it provides a
clear, logical link to establish the impact of the difference
between what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> found (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX>) and what should be
(criteria). Effect is easier to understand when it is stated
clearly, concisely, and in concrete terms. The significance of the
reported effect can be demonstrated through credible
evidence.


8.17 When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> conclude, based on evidence obtained, that
significant fraud, illegal acts, or other noncompliance either has
occurred or is likely to have occurred, they should include in
their audit report the relevant information. The term
"noncompliance" comprises illegal acts (violations of laws and
regulations) and violations of provisions of contracts or grant
agreements. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> conclude significant abuse has or is
likely to have occurred, they should also include
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
Common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for criteria are laws, regulations, policy,
procedures, best or standard practice, or assertions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Government</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control-Integrated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX>, published
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sponsoring Organizations</ENAMEX> of the Treadway
Commission (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COSO Report</ENAMEX>) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of established criteria
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> can use to support their judgments and conclusions about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards</ENAMEX>
Exposure Draft
relevant information in the report. Abuse occurs when the
conduct of a government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, program, activity, or
function falls short of societal expectations for prudent
behavior.


8.18
In reporting significant instances of noncompliance,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should place their findings in perspective. To give the
report user a basis for judging the prevalence and consequences of
noncompliance, the instances of noncompliance should be related to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or the number of cases examined and quantified in
terms of dollar value, if appropriate. If the results cannot be
projected, the conclusion should be limited to the items
tested.


8.19
In reporting on internal control, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
describe the scope of internal control testing, and in presenting
the results of those tests, report the significant weaknesses<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may identify significant weaknesses in internal control as
the cause of deficient performance. In reporting this type of
finding, the control weakness would be described as the
"cause."


8.20
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> detect nonsignificant instances of fraud,
illegal acts, or other noncompliance or nonsignificant instances of
abuse or weaknesses in internal control, they should communicate
them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited program, preferably in
writing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should include in their audit documentation all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited program about fraud,
illegal acts, or other noncompliance and instances of abuse or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> control weaknesses. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have communicated such
instances of fraud, illegal acts, or other noncompliance, abuse,
and internal control weaknesses in a management letter to top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should refer to that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> letter in the
audit report.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
Significant weaknesses are matters coming to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>'
attention that they believe should be reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the
audited program because they could adversely affect the program
under audit. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure</ENAMEX>
Draft
Direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reporting of Fraud and Illegal Acts</ENAMEX>


8.21
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are responsible for reporting certain fraud and
illegal acts directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> outside the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> in
certain circumstances, as discussed in the following paragraphs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should fulfill these responsibilities even if they have
resigned or been dismissed from the audit<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX>


8.22
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> may be required by law or
regulation to report certain fraud and illegal acts to specified
external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> such as a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector general</ENAMEX> or a state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> have communicated such fraud and
illegal acts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, and the latter
fail to report them, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should communicate their
awareness of that failure to the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> do not make the required report
as soon as practical after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' communication with its
governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report the fraud and
illegal acts directly to the external party specified in the law or
regulation.


8.23
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should obtain sufficient, competent, and
relevant evidence, such as confirmation with outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, to
corroborate assertions by management that it has reported fraud or
illegal acts. If they are unable to do so, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should
report the fraud or illegal acts directly as discussed
above.


8.24
Laws, regulations, or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> may require
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to report promptly indications of fraud or other illegal
acts to law enforcement or investigatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. In such
circumstances, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> conclude that fraud or another illegal
act either has or is likely to have occurred, they should refer it
to law enforcement or investigatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> and ask those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> or legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> if reporting certain information about
the potential fraud or illegal act would compromise investigative
or legal proceedings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should limit the extent of their
reporting to matters that would not compromise those proceedings,
such as information that is already a part of the public
record.


7Internal audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> do not have a duty to report
outside that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> unless required by law, rule, regulation, or
policy.
Conclusions
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should report conclusions when called for by the
audit objectives. Conclusions are logical inferences about the
program based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings and should flow from the
findings, instead of representing a summary of them. Conclusions
should be clearly stated, not implied. The strength of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' conclusions depends on the persuasiveness of the evidence
supporting the findings and the soundness of the logic used to
formulate the conclusions. Conclusions are stronger if they set up
the report's recommendations and convince the knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of
the report that action is necessary.
Recommendations


8.26
If warranted, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should make recommendations for
actions to improve programs and operations and to correct problem
areas identified during the audit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should make
recommendations when the potential for improvement in programs,
operations, and performance is substantiated by the reported
findings and conclusions. Recommendations should logically flow
from the evidence and need to state clearly the actions to be
taken. Recommendations to effect compliance with laws and
regulations and improve internal control also should be made when
significant instances of fraud, illegal acts, or other
noncompliance are noted or significant abuse or weaknesses in
controls are found.


8.27
Constructive recommendations can encourage improvements
in the conduct of government programs and operations. For
recommendations to be most constructive, they should be directed at
resolving the cause of identified problems, action oriented and
specific, addressed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> that have the authority to act,
practical, and, to the extent feasible, cost effective and
measurable.


Statement on Compliance With Generally
Accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should report that the audit was made in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
The statement of compliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAGAS</ENAMEX> refers to all the applicable
standards that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should have followed during the audit.
The statement should be qualified in situations in which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> did not follow an applicable standard. In these
situations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report in the scope section the
applicable standard that was not followed, the reasons therefore,
and how not following the standard affected the results of the
audit.
Views of Responsible Officials


8.29
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should report the views of responsible officials
of the audited program concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings, conclusions,
and recommendations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most effective ways to ensure that
a report is fair, complete, and objective is to obtain advance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and comments by responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited entity
and others, as may be appropriate. Including the views of
responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> produces a report that shows not only what
was found, and what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> think about it, but also what the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in the audited entity think about the report and what
they plan to do about it.


8.30
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should normally request that the responsible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>' views on significant findings, conclusions, and
recommendations be submitted in writing. Oral comments are
acceptable as well, and, in some cases, may be the only or most
expeditious way to obtain comments. Cases in which obtaining oral
comments can be effective include when there is a time-critical
need to meet a user's needs; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> has worked closely with
the responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> throughout the conduct of the work and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are very familiar with the findings and issues
addressed in the draft product; or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> does not expect
major disagreements with the draft report's findings, conclusions,
and recommendations, or perceive any major controversies with
regard to the issues discussed in the draft report. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> should
prepare a summary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>' oral comments and provide a
copy


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
of the summary to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> to verify that the comments are accurately
stated.


8.31
Comments should be fairly and objectively evaluated and
recognized, as appropriate, in the final report. Comments, such as
a promise or plan for corrective action, should be noted but should
not be accepted as justification for dropping a significant finding
or a related recommendation.


8.32
When the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s comments state that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>'s findings, conclusions, or recommendations are inaccurate
or misleading and those comments are not, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' opinion,
valid, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should state their reasons for disagreeing with
the comments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' disagreement should be stated in a fair
and objective manner. Conversely, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should modify their
report as necessary if they find the comments valid. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may
wish to attach the comment letter to the audit report to provide
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> with both points of view.


<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Privileged and Confidential Information</ENAMEX>


8.33
If certain information is prohibited from general
disclosure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should report the nature of the information
omitted and the requirement that makes the omission necessary.
Certain information may be prohibited from general disclosure by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX>, state, or local laws or regulations. In such
circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may issue a separate limited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> use
report containing such information and distribute the report only
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> authorized by law or regulation to receive it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX>
should, when appropriate, consult with legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> regarding any
requirements or other circumstances that may necessitate the
omission of certain information. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> make the judgment that
certain pertinent information should be excluded from a publicly
available report, they should state the nature of the information
omitted and the reasons that make the omission
necessary.


8.34
Additional circumstances associated with public safety
and security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> could also justify the exclusion of certain
information in the report. For example, detailed information
related to computer security for a particular program may be
excluded from publicly available reports because


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
of the potential damage that could be caused by the misuse of
this information. In such circumstances, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> may issue a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> use report containing such information and
distribute the report only to those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> responsible for acting
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' recommendations. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> make the judgment
that certain additional information should be excluded from a
publicly available report, they should state the nature of the
information omitted and the reasons that makes the omission
necessary.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> are expected to act with integrity in judging
whether any information should be excluded from publicly available
reports. These judgments need to be made in a consistent manner
with consideration of the broader public interest in the program or
activity under review. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> need to weigh the need to reveal
all significant facts known to them which, if not revealed, could
either distort the results or conceal improper or unlawful practice
against any requirements or other circumstances that may
necessitate the omission of certain information.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORT QUALITY</ENAMEX>
8.36 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> reporting standard for performance audits is:
The reports should be timely, fact-based, accurate, objective,
convincing, clear, and as concise as the subject permits.
Timely


8.37
To be of maximum use, the audit report needs to provide
relevant information in time to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, legislative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' legitimate needs. Likewise, the
information provided in the report needs to be current. Therefore,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should plan for the appropriate issuance of the report and
conduct the audit with these goals in mind.


8.38
During the audit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should consider interim
reporting of significant matters to appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.
Such communication, which may be oral or written, is not a
substitute for a final report, but it does alert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to
matters needing immediate attention and permits them to correct
them before the final report is completed.


Fact-Based


8.39
Being fact-based requires that the report contains all
evidence needed to satisfy the audit objectives and promotes an
adequate and correct understanding of the matters reported. It also
means the report states information and findings completely,
including all necessary facts and explanations. Giving report users
an adequate and correct understanding means providing perspective
on the extent and significance of reported findings, such as the
frequency of occurrence relative to the number of cases or
transactions tested, and the relationship of the findings to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entity</ENAMEX>'s operations.


8.40
In most cases, a single example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">deficiency</ENAMEX> is not
sufficient to support a broad conclusion or a related
recommendation. All that it supports is that a deviation, an error,
or a weakness existed. Sufficient detailed supporting data should
be included to make convincing presentations.


Accurate


8.41
Accuracy requires that the evidence presented be true and
that findings be correctly portrayed. The need for accuracy is
based on the need to assure report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> that what is reported is
credible and reliable. One inaccuracy in a report can cast doubt on
the validity of an entire report and can divert attention from the
substance of the report. Also, use of inaccurate evidence can
damage the credibility of the issuing audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and reduce
the effectiveness of its reports.


8.42
The report should include only information, findings, and
conclusions that are supported by competent and relevant evidence
in the audit documentation. If data are significant to the
audit


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>-340G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Auditing Standards Exposure Draft</ENAMEX>
findings and conclusions, but are not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">audited</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should clearly indicate in their report the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>'s limitations and not make unwarranted conclusions or
recommendations based on those data.
8.43 Reported evidence should demonstrate the correctness and
reasonableness of the matters reported. Correct portrayal means
describing accurately the audit scope and methodology, and
presenting findings and conclusions in a manner consistent with the
scope of audit work. The report should not have errors in logic and
reasoning. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to help ensure accuracy in the report is to use
a quality control process such as referencing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Referencing</ENAMEX> is a
process in which statements of facts, figures, and dates are traced
back to the supporting working papers by an experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> who
is independent of the audit. This process is designed to ensure
that sufficient credible evidence is present to support the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX>'s conclusions and recommendations.
Objective


8.44
Objectivity requires that the presentation of the entire
report be balanced in content and tone. A report's credibility is
significantly enhanced when it presents evidence in an unbiased
manner so that report <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> can be persuaded by the facts. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> should be fair and not misleading, and should place the
audit results in perspective. This means presenting the audit
results impartially and fairly. In describing shortcomings in
performance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should put findings in context. For example,
the audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> may have faced unusual difficulties or
circumstances.


8.45
The tone of reports should encourage decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> to
act on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>' findings and recommendations. This tone should
be balanced by requiring reports to present sound and logical
evidence to support conclusions, while refraining from using
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjectives</ENAMEX> or adverbs that characterize evidence in a way that
implies criticism or conclusion by innuendo.


8.46
The report should also recognize the positive aspects of
the program reviewed if applicable to the audit objectives.
Inclusion of positive program aspects may lead to improved
performance by other government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that read the
report.


Convincing
8.47 Being convincing requires that the audit results be
responsive to the audit objectives, the findings be presented
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persuasively</ENAMEX>, and the conclusions and recommendations follow
logically from the facts presented. The information presented
should be sufficient to convince the report users to recognize the
validity of the findings, the reasonableness of the conclusions,
and the benefit of implementing the recommendations. Reports
designed in this way can help focus the attention of responsible
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> on the matters that warrant attention and can help
stimulate correction.
Clear


8.48
Clarity requires that the report be easy to read and
understand. Reports should be prepared in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> as clear and
simple as the subject permits. Use of straightforward, nontechnical
language is essential to simplicity of presentation. Whenever
technical terms, abbreviations, and acronyms are used, they should
be clearly defined.


8.49
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Auditors</ENAMEX> may consider using a summary within the report
to capture the report user's attention and highlight the overall
message. If a summary is used, it generally should focus on the
specific answers to the questions in the audit objectives,
summarize the audit's most significant findings and the report's
principal conclusions, and prepare users to anticipate the major
recommendations.


8.50
Logical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, and accuracy and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> in stating facts and in drawing conclusions, are
essential to clarity and understanding. Effective use of titles and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">captions</ENAMEX> and topic sentences makes the report easier to read and
understand. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Visual aids</ENAMEX> (such as pictures, charts, graphs, and
maps) should be used when appropriate to clarify and summarize
complex material.


Concise
8.51 Being concise requires that the report be no longer than
necessary to convey and support the message. Extraneous detail
detracts from a report, may even conceal the real message, and may
confuse or distract the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Also, needless repetition should be
avoided. Although room exists for considerable judgment in
determining the content of reports, those that are fact-based, but
still concise, are likely to achieve greater results.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REPORT ISSUANCE AND DISTRIBUTION</ENAMEX>
8.52 The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> reporting standard for performance audits
is:
Audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should submit audit reports to the
appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the audited program and to the appropriate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> requiring or arranging for the
audits, including external funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, unless legal
restrictions prevent it. Copies of the reports should also be sent
to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who have legal oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> or who may be
responsible for acting on audit findings and recommendations and to
others authorized to receive such reports. Unless the report is
restricted by law or regulation, copies should be made available
for public inspection.


8.53
Audit reports should be distributed in a timely manner to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> interested in the results. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> include those
designated by law or regulation to receive such reports, those
responsible for acting on the findings and recommendations, those
of other levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> who have provided assistance to the
audited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>. However, if the subject of the
audit involves material that is classified for security purposes or
is not releasable to particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> for other
valid reasons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should limit the report
distribution.


8.54
When nongovernment audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are engaged, the
engaging government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should ensure that the report is
distributed appropriately. If the nongovernment audit organization
is to make the distribution, the engagement agreement should
indicate which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should receive the
report.


8.55
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> should follow their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s own
arrangements and statutory requirements for distribution. Usually,
they report to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>'s top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, who are responsible for
distribution of the report. Further distribution of reports outside
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> should be made in accordance with applicable law,
rule, regulation, or policy.
