<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS</ENAMEX> UNDER <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 801</NUMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)(i)-(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) OF A MAJOR RULE
ISSUED BY THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND</ENAMEX> HEALTH

<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1218-AA05</ENAMEX>)
(i) Cost-benefit analysis
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> conducted an economic analysis of the costs and benefits of
the final respiratory protection rule.
The analysis shows that the incremental costs to the industry as
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX> are estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$111 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>. The costs of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> fit testing, estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$67 million</NUMEX>, and annual
training, estimated to cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$35.9 million</NUMEX>, comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of
the total costs.
The benefits of the final rule are expected to be an exposure
reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent to 43 percent</NUMEX>, with a best estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
percent. Such a reduction is estimated to prevent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">289 to 1,187</NUMEX>
inhalation injuries/illnesses per year and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">554 to 8,095</NUMEX> chronic
respiratory illnesses per year, with a best estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,046</NUMEX>
injuries and illnesses prevented per year. This reduction is
estimated to save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18.8 to $218 million</NUMEX> per year, with a best
estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$93.9 million</NUMEX> per year. Finally, the analysis estimates
aversion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203 to 835</NUMEX> cancer deaths and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125 to 845</NUMEX> deaths related
to cardiovascular disease <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, with a best estimate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">932</NUMEX>
lives saved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> has certified to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX> that the
final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. No small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> in any industry would
need to increase its prices by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than .05 percent</NUMEX> to compensate
for the costs of compliance with the final rule.
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the

The final rule will impose a private sector mandate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $100</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>. There is no intergovernmental mandate because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>
standards do not apply to state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, except in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that have voluntarily elected to adopt an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA State</ENAMEX>
Plan.
