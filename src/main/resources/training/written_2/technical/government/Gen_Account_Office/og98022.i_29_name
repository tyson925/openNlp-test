Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(A) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>,
this is our report on a group of rules which constitute major rules
promulgated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-22</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service; Department of Labor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pension</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welfare Benefits Administration</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Services</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX>; entitled
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interim Rules for Mental Health Parity</ENAMEX>" (RIN: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1545-AV53</TIMEX>;
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1210-AA62</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0938-AI05</TIMEX>). We received the rules from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 22, 1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 30, 1997</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2, 1998</TIMEX>. They were published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> as
interim rules on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 22, 1997</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66932</NUMEX>.
The interim rules govern parity between medical/surgical
benefits and mental health benefits in group health plans and
health insurance coverage offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">issuers</ENAMEX> in connection with a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> health plan. The rules implement changes made to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX>
Revenue <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Code</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</ENAMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> (ERISA), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health</ENAMEX> Service Act (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PHS Act</ENAMEX>)
contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mental Health</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Parity Act of 1996</ENAMEX> (MHPA) and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Taxpayer Relief Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>.
We note that the interim rules have a listed effective date of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 1998</TIMEX>, which is less than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> delay in the
effective date required by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Regulatory</ENAMEX>
Enforcement Fairness <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1996</ENAMEX> (SBREFA). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have cited
the "good cause" exception to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> delay requirement
contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 808</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 808</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that,
notwithstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>, "any rule which an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> for good
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cause</ENAMEX> finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of
reasons therefor in the rule issued) that notice and public
procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to
the public interest" shall take effect at such time as the federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> promulgating the rule determines. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> took this
action in order to have rules in place when the statutorily
mandated effective date occurs.
Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> invoked the similarly worded "good cause"
exception contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Administrative Procedure Act</ENAMEX> (APA) at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 553</ENAMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>), which allows an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to forego issuing a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> of proposed rulemaking and receiving public comments.
In the past, we have concluded that the exception to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX>
delay contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 808</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) cannot be used when a notice of
proposed rulemaking and a public comment period are used in
conformance with the provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APA</ENAMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX>:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare Program</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-275549; B-275552</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 9, 1996</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/OGC-97-9</ENAMEX>. While in this case there was no notice of proposed
rulemaking, we note that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mental Health</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Parity Act of 1996</ENAMEX> was
enacted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1996</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> requested comments on
the legislation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1997</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 months</TIMEX> after enactment. Based on
these time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> alone, it appears likely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> could
have obtained comments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and issued the interim rules in time
to permit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBREFA</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> delay period for congressional
review.

ISSUED BY THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEPARTMENT</ENAMEX> OF THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TREASURY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE</ENAMEX>;
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEPARTMENT OF LABOR</ENAMEX>, PENSION AND WELFARE BENEFITS

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED</ENAMEX> "INTERIM RULES FOR
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MENTAL HEALTH PARITY</ENAMEX>" (RIN: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1545-AV53</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1210-AA62</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0938-AI05</TIMEX>)
(i) Cost-benefit analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> performed
an economic impact analysis on the effects of the interim
rules.
Utilizing figures from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX>, it is
estimated that the total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> direct impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHPA</ENAMEX> would be
to increase aggregate health plan expenditures by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.16 billion</NUMEX>,
not accounting for plan sponsor responses to reduce that impact.
Considering those responses, the actual increase in annual
aggregate health plan expenditures would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$464 million</NUMEX>.
The preamble to the interim rules contains a further discussion
of additional analyses considered and performed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX>,
including an analysis prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lybrand</ENAMEX>. The analyses
utilized different assumptions and generally resulted in smaller
expenditure impact estimates than noted above.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">603-605, 607</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">609</NUMEX>
Since these rules are being issued as interim rules and were not
previously published through a notice of proposed rulemaking, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments</ENAMEX> were not required to prepare an initial or final
regulatory flexibility analysis under the act. However, the
Departments point out in the preamble to the interim rules that
many of the issues which would have been considered in such
analyses were, in fact, considered. The issues are discussed in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Impact Analysis.</ENAMEX>
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532-1535</TIMEX>
Since the rules were issued as interim rules and not as general
notices of proposed rulemaking, they are not subject to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments</ENAMEX>
indicate that the rules have been designed to be the least
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-22</NUMEX>
burdensome alternative on state, local, and tribal governments
and the private sector.
(iv) Other relevant information or requirements under acts and
executive orders

These rules were adopted on an interim basis because the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretaries</ENAMEX> determined that the publication of a proposed
regulation, for the purpose of notice and public comment, would be
impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretaries</ENAMEX> found that the requirements are effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 1998</TIMEX>, under the provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHPA</ENAMEX> and that plan
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">issuers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> needed
guidance on the new statutory provisions before the effective
date.
However, comments on the statutory provisions were solicited
from the public by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 26</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34604</NUMEX>), and these comments were considered in
formulating the interim rules.

The interim rules contain information collections subject to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX> and approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>)
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Departments</ENAMEX> have each submitted information collection
requests to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and, according to the preamble, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments of</ENAMEX>
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> have requested emergency approval by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>.
The information collections concern the notice to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX>, and the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of the (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) election of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-percent increased cost exemption, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) calculations and
disclosure of documentation of eligibility for the exemption, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) notice of a group health plan's use of a transition period.
The preamble to the interim rules contain the information
required by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> including the need for the
information, the parties affected, and the burden estimates related
to the collections by each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>.

Executive Order No. 12866
The interim rules were found to be "economically significant"
regulatory actions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Order No. 12866</ENAMEX>. As such,
they were reviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> based on information supplied by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments</ENAMEX>, which included planned regulatory action documents
describing the reason for the rules and an assessment of the costs
and budgetary impact of the rules.
