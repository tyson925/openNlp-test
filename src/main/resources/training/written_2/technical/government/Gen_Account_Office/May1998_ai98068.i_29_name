Learning From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leading Organizations</ENAMEX>

Preface
Increased computer interconnectivity and the popularity of the
Internet are offering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> of all types unprecedented
opportunities to improve operations by reducing paper processing,
cutting costs, and sharing information. However, the success of
many of these efforts depends, in part, on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
ability to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability
of the data and systems it relies on.
Deficiencies in federal information security are a growing
concern. In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1997</TIMEX> series of reports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
designated information security as a governmentwide high-risk area.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Commission on Critical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infrastructure Protection</ENAMEX> described the potentially devastating
implications of poor information security from a broader
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> in its report entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Critical Foundations: Protecting</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infrastructures</ENAMEX>. Since then, audit reports have continued
to identify widespread information security weaknesses that place
critical federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and assets at risk.
Although many factors contribute to these weaknesses, audits by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspectors General</ENAMEX> have found that an underlying cause is
poor security program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. To help identify solutions to
this problem, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Thompson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Glenn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> and
Ranking Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Member</ENAMEX>, respectively, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Committee on</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governmental Affairs</ENAMEX>, requested that we study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> with
superior security programs to identify management practices that
could benefit federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. This guide outlines the results of
that study. It is intended to assist federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in
strengthening their security programs, and we are pleased that it
has been endorsed by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Information Officers</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>.
This guide is one of a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>, listed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">appendix I,</ENAMEX> that are intended to define actions federal officials
can take to better manage their information resources. It was
prepared under the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack L. Brock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governmentwide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Information Systems</ENAMEX>, who can be reached

A Message From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Chief Information Officers</ENAMEX>
Council
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 7, 1998</TIMEX>
A high priority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Council</ENAMEX> is to ensure the
implementation of security practices within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> government
that gain public confidence and protect government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>,
privacy, and sensitive and national security information. This
Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Learning From</ENAMEX>
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX>," clearly illustrates how leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> are successfully addressing the challenges of
fulfilling that goal. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> establish a central
management focal point, promote awareness, link policies to
business risks, and develop practical risk assessment procedures
that link security to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> needs. This latter point--the need
to link security to business requirements--is particularly
important, and is illustrated in a statement of a security manager
quoted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>: "Because every control has some cost
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with it, every control needs a business reason to be put
in place."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Council</ENAMEX> is pleased to endorse the principles and best
practices embodied in this guide. Its findings underscore the
policies articulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix III</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-130</ENAMEX>,
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Automated Information Resources</ENAMEX>." We expect
that it will be a valuable resource for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> and program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who execute those policies, and will complement the other
activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> information systems
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>.
We look forward to working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> in
the future as we implement these best practices to further enhance
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> security practices and programs.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Information Security</ENAMEX> Is A Growing Concern




<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Information Security</ENAMEX> Is A Growing Concern
Electronic information and automated systems are essential to
virtually all major federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> cannot protect
the availability, integrity, and, in some cases, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">confidentiality</ENAMEX>, of this information, their ability to carry out
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> will be severely impaired. However, despite the
enormous dependence on electronic information and systems, audits
continue to disclose serious information security weaknesses. As a
result, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> in federal assets are at risk of loss,
vast amounts of sensitive data are at risk of inappropriate
disclosure, and critical computer-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are vulnerable
to serious disruptions.
This guide is designed to promote senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>' awareness
of information security issues and to provide information they can
use to establish a management framework for more effective
information security programs. Most senior federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, like
many of their private sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, are just beginning to
recognize the significance of these risks and to fully appreciate
the importance of protecting their information resources. The
opening segments describe the problem of weak information security
at federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, identify existing federal guidance, and
describe the issue of information security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in the
context of other information technology management issues. The
remainder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> describes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> practices, organized under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
management principles, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> identified during a study of
nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> with reputations for having good
information security programs. Each of these practices contains
specific examples of the techniques used by these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to
increase their security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX>'s effectiveness.

Potential Risks Are Significant
Although they have relied on computers for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> throughout the
world, are experiencing an explosion in the use of electronic data
and networked computer systems. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have become
enormously dependent on these systems and data to support their
operations.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>, alone, has a vast information
infrastructure that includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1 million</NUMEX> computers and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> that are used to
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX>
exchange electronic messages, obtain data from remote computer
sites, and maintain critical records. Civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> also are
increasingly reliant on automated, often interconnected, systems,
including the Internet, to support their operations. For
example,
law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> rely on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Crime Information</ENAMEX>
Center
computerized database for access to sensitive criminal justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> on
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX>;
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> relies on computers to process and
store
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of confidential taxpayer records;
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> relies on automated systems to support its
processing
and inspection of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of billions of dollars</NUMEX> worth of
imported <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goods</ENAMEX>;
and
many federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX>
Administration, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>, rely on automated systems to manage and distribute
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> worth of payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medicare</ENAMEX>, social security, and food stamp benefits.
Although these advances promise to streamline federal operations
and improve the delivery of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>, they also expose
these activities to greater risks. This is because automated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and records are fast replacing manual procedures and paper
documents, which in many cases are no longer available as "backup"
if automated systems should fail.
This risk is exacerbated because, when systems are
interconnected to form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> or are accessible through public
telecommunication systems, they are much more vulnerable to
anonymous intrusions from remote locations. Also, much of the
information maintained by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, although unclassified,
is extremely sensitive, and many automated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are
attractive targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> with malicious
intentions, such as committing fraud for personal gain or
sabotaging federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have experienced
intrusions into their systems, and there are indications, such as
tests at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>, that the number of attacks is
growing and that many attacks are not detected.
Additional risks stem from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> efforts to examine and adjust
their computer systems to ensure that they properly recognize the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year 2000</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These Year 2000</TIMEX> conversion efforts are often conducted
under severe time constraints that, without adequate management
attention, could result in a weakening of controls over the
integrity of data and programs and over the confidentiality of
sensitive data.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security</ENAMEX> Risks



<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weaknesses Abound</ENAMEX>, but Management Attention Has Been
Lacking
"Just as in the private sector, many federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are
reluctant to make the investments required in this area [of
computer security] because of limited budgets, lack of direction
and prioritization from senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and general ignorance of
the threat."
-- Statement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary R. Bachula</ENAMEX>, Acting Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> for
Technology, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Commerce</ENAMEX>, before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Science</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subcommittee on Technology</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 19, 1997</TIMEX>
Unfortunately, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are not adequately protecting
their systems and data. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1996</TIMEX>, we reported that audit
reports and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> selfassessments issued during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous 2</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> showed that weak information security was a widespread
problem<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> Specifically, weaknesses such as poor controls over
access to data and inadequate disaster recovery plans increased the
risk of losses, inappropriate disclosures, and disruptions in
service associated with the enormous amounts of electronically
maintained information essential for delivering federal services
and assessing the success of federal programs. Due to these
previously reported weaknesses and findings resulting from our
ongoing work, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1997</TIMEX>, we designated information security
as a new governmentwide high-risk issue<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>
In our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1996</TIMEX> report, we stated that an underlying cause
of federal information security weaknesses was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had
not implemented information security programs that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) established
appropriate policies and controls and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) routinely monitored their
effectiveness. Despite repeated reports of serious problems, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had not provided the management attention needed
to ensure that their information security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> were
effective.
Also, in that report, we made a number of recommendations
intended to improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>)
oversight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> information security practices and strengthen
its leadership role in this area. Specifically, we recommended that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> promote the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Information Officers Council</ENAMEX>'s
adoption of information security as one of its top priorities and
encourage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> to develop a strategic plan for increasing
awareness of the importance of information security, especially
among senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, and improving information security
program management

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">governmentwide</ENAMEX>. Initiatives that we suggested for the CIO
Council to consider
incorporating in its strategic plan included
developing information on the existing security risks associated
with
nonclassified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> currently in use,
developing information on the risks associated with evolving
practices,
such as Internet use,
identifying best practices regarding information security
programs so
that they can be adopted by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>,
establishing a program for reviewing the adequacy of individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>
information security programs using interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">reviewers,</ENAMEX>
ensuring adequate review coverage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> information
security
practices by considering the scope of various types of audits
and
reviews performed and acting to address any identified gaps
in
coverage,
developing or identifying training and certification programs
that could
be shared among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, and
identifying proven security tools and techniques.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Council</ENAMEX>, under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>,
has taken some significant actions, which include designating
information security as one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> priority areas and establishing
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Committee</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Committee</ENAMEX>, in turn, has
developed a preliminary plan for addressing various aspects of the
problem, established links with other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> involved in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> issues, held a security awareness day for federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and begun exploring ways to improve federal incident
response capabilities.
Although there is more that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Council</ENAMEX> can do,
information security is primarily the responsibility of individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. This is because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are in the best position
to assess the risks associated with their programs and to develop
and implement appropriate policies and controls to mitigate these
risks. Accordingly, in our reports over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</TIMEX>, we
have made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of specific recommendations to individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Although many of these recommendations have been
implemented, similar weaknesses continue to surface because
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have not implemented a management framework for overseeing
information security on an agencywide and ongoing basis. A list of
our previous reports and testimonies on information security is
provided at the end of this guide.


Requirements <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Are Outlined in Laws and Guidance</ENAMEX>
The need for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to protect sensitive and critical,
but unclassified, federal data has been recognized for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in
various laws, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Privacy Act of 1974</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork</ENAMEX>
Reduction <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1995</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer</ENAMEX>
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX>
Security <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1987</ENAMEX>. Further, since enactment of the original
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> has been responsible for
developing information security guidance and overseeing agency
practices, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Computer Security Act</ENAMEX> assigns the National
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Standards and Technology</ENAMEX> (NIST) primary responsibility
for developing technical standards and providing related guidance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> responsibilities regarding information
security were recently reemphasized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clinger-Cohen Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, formerly named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology Management Reform</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1996</ENAMEX>. The adequacy of controls over computerized data is
also addressed indirectly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Managers' Financial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Integrity Act of 1982</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> Act of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Managers</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Financial Integrity Act</ENAMEX> requires agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> evaluate their internal control systems and
report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> any material weaknesses
that could lead to fraud, waste, and abuse in government
operations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> Act requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to
develop and maintain financial management systems that provide
complete, reliable, consistent, and timely information.
In addition, a considerable body of federal guidance on
information security has been developed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> has provided guidance
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A130</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Automated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Resources</ENAMEX>, which was updated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX> has issued numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Information</ENAMEX>
Processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX>, as well as a comprehensive description of
basic concepts and techniques entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">An Introduction to Computer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The NIST Handbook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Special Publication 800-12</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology Systems</ENAMEX>,3 published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1996</TIMEX>.
Additional federal requirements have been established for the
protection of information that has been classified for national
security purposes. However, these requirements are not discussed
here because this guide pertains to the protection of sensitive but
unclassified data, which constitute the bulk of data supporting
most federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exploring Practices of Leading Organizations</ENAMEX>
To supplement our ongoing audit work at federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and
gain a broader understanding of how information security programs
can be successfully implemented, we studied the management
practices of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> nonfederal
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix II</ENAMEX> lists the principles identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX>'s Generally
Accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principles and Practices for Securing Information</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Systems</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1996</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX> Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> recognized as having strong information security
programs. The specific objective of our review was to determine how
such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have designed and implemented their programs in
order to identify practices that could be applied at federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
We focused primarily on the management framework that these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> had established rather than on the specific controls
that they had chosen, because previous audit work had identified
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> as an underlying problem at federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
Although powerful technical controls, such as those involving
encryption, are becoming increasingly available to facilitate
information security, effective implementation requires that these
techniques be thoughtfully selected and that their use be monitored
and managed on an ongoing basis. In addition, there are many
aspects of information security, such as risk assessment, policy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, and disaster recovery planning, that require
coordinated management attention.
To identify leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, we reviewed professional
literature and research information and solicited suggestions from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, nationally known public
accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. In selecting organizations
to include in our study, we relied primarily on recommendations
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Security Institute</ENAMEX> and public accounting firms
because they were in a position to evaluate and compare information
security programs at numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. In addition, we
attempted to select <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> from a variety of business
sectors to gain a broad perspective on the information security
practices being employed. After initial conversations with a number
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, we narrowed our focus to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that
had implemented fairly comprehensive organizationwide information
security programs. All were prominent nationally known
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>. They included a financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>, a
regional electric utility, a state university, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX>, a state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>, a nonbank financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX>, and an
equipment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. The number of computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> at these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500 to 100,000</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> had
significant international operations. Because most of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> considered discussions of their security programs to
be sensitive and they wanted to avoid undue public attention on
this aspect of their operations, we agreed not to identify the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> by name.
We obtained information primarily through interviews with senior
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and document analysis conducted during and after
visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied. In a few cases, we toured
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and observed practices in operation.
We supplemented these findings, to a very limited extent, with
information obtained from others. For example, at the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>,
we also met with a statewide security program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> and with
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>. In addition, we asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Security</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> to
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX>
query its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> about their efforts to measure the
effectiveness of their security programs in order to gain a broader
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> of practices in this area.
To determine the applicability of the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
practices to federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, we discussed our findings with
numerous federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Policy and Technology Branch</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Security</ENAMEX>
Division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology Laboratory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Council</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittee</ENAMEX>, information security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Commission on Critical</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infrastructure Protection</ENAMEX>. Further, we discussed our findings with
our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Council on Information Management and Technology</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> with extensive experience in information
technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> who advise us on major information management
issues affecting federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>, we make several observations on federal
information security practices in order to contrast them with the
practices of the nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied. These
observations are based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of work we have developed over
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last several years</TIMEX> and on our recent discussions with federal
information security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who are
knowledgeable about federal information security practices.
Although we attempted to be as thorough as possible within the
scope of our study, we recognize that more work in this area
remains to be done, including a more in-depth study of individual
practices. We also recognize that the practices require customized
application at individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> depending on factors such
as existing organizational strengths and weaknesses.


Security as an Element of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broader Information Management</ENAMEX>
Strategy
Although this guide focuses on information security program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, this is only one aspect of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s overall
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> strategy. As such, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s success
in managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security</ENAMEX>-related efforts is likely to hinge on its
overall ability to manage its use of information technology.
Unfortunately, federal performance in this broader area has been
largely inadequate. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 6 years</TIMEX>, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have
spent a reported <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$145 billion</NUMEX> on information technology with
generally disappointing mission-related results.
Recognizing the need for improved information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has enacted legislation that is prompting landmark reforms
in this area. In particular, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
emphasized the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to acquire and apply information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to effectively support the accomplishment of agency
missions and the delivery of services to the public. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996</ENAMEX> repeated this theme and provided more
detailed requirements. These laws emphasize involving senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in information management decisions, appointing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">senior-level</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief information officers</ENAMEX>, and using performance
measures to assess the contribution of technology in achieving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> results. Although their primary focus is much broader, both
of these laws specify security as one of the aspects of information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> that must be addressed. This environment of reform is
conducive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> rethinking their security programs, as part
of broader information management changes, and considering the
implementation of the practices that have been adopted by
nonfederal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.


Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Issues Affecting Federal Information Security</ENAMEX>
Security program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and the related implementation of
controls over access to data, systems, and software programs, as
well as service continuity planning, are central factors affecting
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s ability to protect its information resources and
the program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> that these resources support. However, there
are numerous policy, technical, legal, and human resource issues
that are not fully within the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. These issues are currently being debated and, in many
cases, addressed by private-sector and federal efforts. They
include, but are not limited to, matters concerning (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the use of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encryption</ENAMEX> to protect the confidentiality of information and other
cryptographic capabilities, including digital signatures and
integrity checks, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) personal privacy, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the adequacy of laws
protecting intellectual property and permitting investigations into
computer-related crimes, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) the availability of adequate
technical expertise and security software tools.
These topics are beyond the scope of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> and, thus, are
not discussed herein. However, it is important to recognize that
strengthening information security requires a multifaceted approach
and sometimes involves issues that are beyond the control of
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Although the management
practices described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> are fundamental to improving an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s information security posture, they should be
considered in the context of this broader spectrum of issues.



Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations Apply Fundamental Risk Management</ENAMEX>
Principles
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied were striving to manage the same
types of risks that face federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. To do so, they had
responded to these risks by reorienting their security programs
from relatively low-profile operations focused primarily on
mainframe security to visible, integral components of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>' business operations. Because of the similarities in
the challenges they face, we believe that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> can
learn from these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to develop their own more effective
security programs.

Federal and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nonfederal Entities Face Similar Risks and Rely on</ENAMEX>
Similar Technologies
Like federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied must protect
the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the information
resources they rely on. Although most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> motivated by the desire to earn profits, their
information security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> focused on providing high-quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">reliable</ENAMEX> service to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, avoiding
fraud and disclosures of sensitive information, promoting efficient
operations, and complying with applicable laws and regulations.
These are the same types of concerns facing federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
Also, like federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> relied, to
varying degrees, on a mix of mainframe and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>-server systems
and made heavy use of interconnected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. In addition, all
were either using or exploring the possibilities of using the
Internet to support their business operations.

Risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Principles Provide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A Framework</ENAMEX> for an Effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Program</ENAMEX>
Although the nature of their operations differed, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> all had embraced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> risk management principles,
which are listed in the box below. These principles guided the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>' efforts to manage the risk associated with the
increasingly automated and interconnected environment in which they
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functioned</ENAMEX>.


Risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Principles Implemented</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leading</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX>
Assess risk and determine needs Establish a central management
focal point Implement appropriate policies and related controls
Promote awareness <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monitor</ENAMEX> and evaluate policy and control
effectiveness
An important factor in effectively implementing these principles
was linking them in a cycle of activity that helped ensure that
information security policies addressed current risks on an ongoing
basis. The single most important factor in prompting the
establishment of an effective security program was a general
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> and understanding among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s most senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> of the enormous risks to business operations associated
with relying on automated and highly interconnected systems.
However, risk assessments of individual business applications
provided the basis for establishing policies and selecting related
controls. Steps were then taken to increase the awareness of users
concerning these risks and related policies. The effectiveness of
controls and awareness activities was then monitored through
various analyses, evaluations, and audits, and the results provided
input to subsequent risk assessments, which determined if existing
policies and controls needed to be modified. All of these
activities were coordinated through a central security management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> or group the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of which served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> and

This continuing cycle of monitoring business risks, maintaining
policies and controls, and monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> parallels the
process associated with managing the controls associated with any
type of program. In addition, these principles should be familiar
to federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> since they have been emphasized in much
of the recent guidance pertaining to federal information security.
Most notably, they incorporate many of the concepts included in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1996</TIMEX> publication, Generally Accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principles</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems</ENAMEX>, and in

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Principles Were Implemented Though Similar Practices</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had developed similar sets of practices to
implement the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> risk management principles, although the
techniques they employed varied depending on each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
size and culture. Some programs were less mature than others and
had not fully implemented all of the practices. However, security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> agreed that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> practices outlined
in the following illustration, which relate to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> risk
management principles, were key to the effectiveness of their

"We are not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of protecting information. We only

-- Senior security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at a major electric utility
All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> said that risk considerations and
related cost-benefit trade-offs were a primary focus of their
security programs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> was not viewed as an end in itself, but
as a set of policies and related controls designed to support
business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, much like other types of internal
controls<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
Controls were identified and implemented to address specific
business risks. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> said,
"Because every control has some cost associated with it, every
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> needs a business reason to be put in place." Regardless of
whether they were analyzing existing or proposed operations,
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> told us that identifying and assessing
information security risks in terms of the impact on business
operations was an essential step in determining what controls were
needed and what level of resources could be expended on controls.
In this regard, understanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> risks associated with
information security was the starting point of the risk management
cycle.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s recently revised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standards</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Control</ENAMEX> in the
Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exposure Draft</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.3.1</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>

-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte & Touche LLP Survey of American Business</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1996</TIMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied recognized that information and
information systems were critical assets essential to supporting
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> that must be protected. As a result, they viewed
information protection as an integral part of their business
operations and of their strategic planning.

Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executive</ENAMEX> Support Is Crucial
In particular, senior executive recognition of information
security risks and interest in taking steps to understand and
manage these risks were the most important factors in prompting
development of more formal information security programs. Such
high-level interest helped ensure that information security was
taken seriously at lower organizational levels and that security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> had the resources needed to implement an effective
program.
This contrasts with the view expressed to us by numerous federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> that many top federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have
not recognized the indispensable nature of electronic data and
automated systems to their program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. As a result,
security-related activities intended to protect these resources do
not receive the resources and attention that they merit.
In some cases, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s interest had been generated
by an incident that starkly illustrated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
information security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vulnerabilities</ENAMEX>, even though no damage may
have actually occurred. In other cases, incidents at other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> had served as a "wake-up call." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
noted that significant interest on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">directors</ENAMEX> was an important factor in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>' attention
to information security. However, security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organizations</ENAMEX> told us that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officers</ENAMEX> or other
very senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> had an ongoing interest in information
technology and security, which translated into an organizationwide
emphasis on these areas.
Although the emphasis on security generally emanated from top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> at lower levels nurtured this
emphasis by keeping them
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX>
abreast of emerging security issues, educating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at all
levels, and by emphasizing the related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> risks to their own
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.


Security Seen As An Enabler
In addition, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were aggressively
exploring ways to improve operational efficiency and service to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> through new or expanded applications of information
technology, which usually prompted new security considerations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> viewed their ability to exploit
information technology as giving them a significant competitive
advantage. In this regard, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> told us that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> was increasingly being viewed as an enabler--a necessary
step in mitigating the risks associated with new applications
involving Internet use and broadened access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
computerized data. As a result, security was seen as an important
component in improving business operations by creating
opportunities to use information technology in ways that would not
otherwise be feasible.
Practice <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">2: Develop Practical Risk Assessment Procedures That</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Link Security</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Needs</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied had tried or were exploring various
risk assessment methodologies, ranging from very informal
discussions of risk to fairly complex methods involving the use of
specialized software tools. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that were
the most satisfied with their risk assessment procedures were those
that had defined a relatively simple process that could be adapted
to various organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and involved a mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
with knowledge of business operations and technical aspects of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s systems and security controls.
The manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had developed an automated checklist
that asked business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in individual units
a series of questions that prompted them to consider the impact of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> controls, or a lack thereof, on their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s operations.
The results of the analysis were reported in a letter to senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> that stated the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s compliance with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> policy, planned actions to become compliant, or
willingness to accept the risk. The results were also reported to
the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, who used them as a basis for reviewing the
business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s success in implementing the controls that the
unit's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> had determined were needed. Through the reporting
procedure, the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> took responsibility for either
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tolerating</ENAMEX> or mitigating security risks associated with their
operations.
Such procedures provided a relatively quick and consistent means
of exploring risk with business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, selecting cost-effective
controls, and documenting conclusions and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> of final determinations regarding what controls were
needed and what risks could be tolerated. With similar objectives
in mind, the utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had developed a streamlined risk
assessment process that brought together business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and
technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to discuss risk factors and mitigating controls.
(This process is described in detail as a case example on page
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>.)
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had developed less formal and comprehensive
techniques for ensuring that risks were considered prior to changes
in operations.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> had established standard procedures for requesting
and granting new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">network connections</ENAMEX>. Under these procedures,
documentation about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> need for the proposed connection
and the risks associated with the proposed connection had to be
submitted in writing prior to consideration by the central security
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Then, a meeting between the technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, which
implemented new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>, the requester, and the central
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was held to further explore the issue. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> and meeting helped

ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">requester</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> needs were clearly
understood and the best solution was adopted without compromising
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s security.
The financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> had implemented procedures
for documenting business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>' decisions to deviate from
organizationwide policies and standards. In order to deviate from a
"mandatory policy," the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> prepared a letter explaining
the reason for the deviation and recognizing the related risk. Both
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> and the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> manager
signed the letter to acknowledge their agreement to the necessity
of the policy deviation. Deviations from less rigid "standards"
were handled similarly, although the letter could be signed by the
business unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>, alone, and did not require the central
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s approval, though it was generally received. In all
cases, the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> discussed the information
security implications of the deviation with the appropriate
executive and signed-off only when it was satisfied that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> fully understood the risk associated with the deviation.
However, the ultimate decision on whether a deviation from policies
or standards was appropriate was usually left to the business
unit.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organizations Saw Benefits Despite Lack</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Precision</ENAMEX>
"Actual losses are not necessarily good indications of risk."
--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at a prominent financial institution
Although all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> placed emphasis on
understanding risks, none attempted to precisely quantify them,
noting that few quantified data are available on the likelihood of
an incident occurring or on the amount of damage that is likely to
result from a particular type of incident. Such data are not
available because many losses are never discovered and others are
never reported, even within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> where they occurred.
In addition, there are limited data on the full costs of damage
caused by security weaknesses and on the operational costs of
specific control techniques. Further, due to fastpaced changes in
technology and factors such as the tools available to wouldbe
intruders, the value of applying data collected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past years</TIMEX> to
the current environment is questionable. As a result, it is
difficult, if not impossible, to precisely compare the cost of
controls with the risk of loss in order to determine which controls
are the most cost-effective. Ultimately, business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> must rely on the best information available
and their best judgment in determining what controls are
needed.
Despite their inability to precisely compare the costs of
controls with reductions in risk, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> said that risk
assessments still served their primary purpose of ensuring that the
risk implications of new and existing applications were explored.
In particular, the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> believed that adequate
information was available to identify the most significant risks.
For example, in addition to their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s experience,
they noted that information on threats, specific software
vulnerabilities, and potential damage was widely available in
technical literature, security bulletins from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> such as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie-Mellon Computer Emergency Response Team</ENAMEX> (CERT),
surveys done by professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> and audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, and
discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Although much of this information was anecdotal,
the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> thought that it was sufficient to give them a
good understanding of the threats of concern to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
and of the potential for damage.
In addition, the lack of quantified results did not diminish the
value of risk assessments as a tool for educating business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>. By increasing the understanding of risks, risk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assessments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) improved business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>' ability to make
decisions on controls needed, in the absence of quantified risk
assessment results, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) engendered support for policies and
controls adopted, thus helping to ensure that policies and controls
would operate as intended.
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>: Hold Program and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Managers Accountable</ENAMEX>
"Holding business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable and changing the security
staff's role from enforcement to service has been a major paradigm
shift for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>."
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at a major equipment manufacturer
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied were unanimous in their conviction
that business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> must bear the primary responsibility for
determining the level of protection needed for information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> that support business operations. In this regard, most
held the view that business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> should be held accountable for
managing the information security risks associated with their
operations, much as they would for any other type of business risk.
However, security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> played a strong educational and
advisory role and had the ability to elevate discussions to higher
management levels when they believed that risks were not being
adequately addressed.
Business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, usually referred to as program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, are generally in the best position to determine
which of their information resources are the most sensitive and
what the business impact of a loss of integrity, confidentiality,
or availability would be. Business or program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are also in
the best position to determine how security controls may impair
their operations. For this reason, involving them in selecting
controls can help ensure that controls are practical and will be
implemented.
Accordingly, security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> had assumed the role of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">educators</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">facilitators</ENAMEX> who helped ensure that
business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> were aware of risks and of control techniques
that had been or could be implemented to mitigate the risks. For
several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, these roles represented a dramatic
reversal from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past years</TIMEX>, when security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> were viewed as
rigid, sometimes overly protective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enforcers</ENAMEX> who often did not
adequately consider the effect of security controls on business
operations.
Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had instituted mechanisms for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documenting</ENAMEX> and reporting business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>' risk determinations.
These generally required some type of sign-off on memoranda that
either (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) reported deviations from predetermined control
requirements, as was the case at the financial services corporation
and the manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> discussed previously or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) provided
the results of risk assessments, as was the case of the utility
company described in the following case example. According to the
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, such sign-off requirements helped ensure that
business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> carefully considered their decisions before
finalizing them.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case Example: A Practical Method for Involving Business</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risk Assessment</ENAMEX>
A major electric utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has developed an efficient and
disciplined process for ensuring that information security-related
risks to business operations are considered and documented. The
process involves analyzing one system or segment of business
operation at a time and convening a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that
includes business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who are familiar with business
information needs and technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who have a detailed
understanding of potential system vulnerabilities and related
controls. The sessions, which follow a standard agenda, are
facilitated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who helps
ensure that business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> communicate
effectively and adhere to the agenda.
During the session, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> brainstorms to identify potential
threats, vulnerabilities, and resultant negative impacts on data
integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Then, they analyze
the effects of such impacts on business operations and broadly
categorize the risks as major or minor. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> does not usually
attempt to obtain or develop specific numbers for threat likelihood
or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> loss estimates unless the data for determining such
factors are readily available. Instead, they rely on their general
knowledge of threats and vulnerabilities obtained from national
incident response <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> and
literature, and their own experience. They believe that additional
efforts to develop precisely quantified risks are not
cost-effective because (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) such estimates take an inordinate amount
of time and effort to identify and verify or develop, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the risk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> becomes too voluminous to be of practical use, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) specific loss estimates are generally not needed to determine
if a control is needed.
After identifying and categorizing risks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> identifies
controls that could be implemented to reduce the risk, focusing on
the most cost-effective controls. As a starting point, they use a
list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 25</NUMEX> common controls designed to address various types
of risk. Ultimately, the decision as to what controls are needed
lies with the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, who take into account the nature
of the information assets and their importance to business
operations and the cost of controls.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s conclusions as to what risks exist and what controls
are needed are documented along with a related action plan for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> implementation. This document is then signed by the senior
business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> participating and copies are
made available to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant groups</ENAMEX> and to the internal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, who may later audit the effectiveness of the agreed upon
controls.
Each risk analysis session takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 4 hours</TIMEX> and
includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 to 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, though sessions with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 50</NUMEX> and as
few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have occurred. Additional time is usually needed to
develop the action plan. The information security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> conducts
between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and 12</NUMEX> sessions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>'s
central information security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, this process increases security
awareness among business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, develops support for needed
controls, and helps integrate information security considerations
into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s business operations.
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manage Risk</ENAMEX> on a Continuing Basis
"Information security is definitely a journey, not a
destination--there are always new challenges to meet."
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief information security officer</ENAMEX> at a major financial
services corporation
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> emphasized the importance of continuous
attention to security to ensure that controls were appropriate and
effective. They stressed that constant vigilance was needed to
ensure that controls remained appropriate--addressing current risks
and not unnecessarily hindering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>--and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
who used and maintained information systems complied with
organizational policies.
Such attention is important for all types of internal controls,
but it is especially important for security over computerized
information, because, as mentioned previously, the factors that
affect computer security are constantly changing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s dynamic
environment. Such changing factors include threats, systems
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> and configurations, known vulnerabilities in existing
software, the level of reliance on automated systems and electronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, and the sensitivity of such operations and data.




Existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Guidance Provides</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Framework</ENAMEX> for Implementing
Risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Practices</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> revision of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-130</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Appendix III</ENAMEX>, recognizes
that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have had difficulty in performing effective
risk assessments--expending resources on complex assessments of
specific risks with limited tangible benefits in terms of improved
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>. For this reason, the revised circular eliminates a
long-standing federal requirement for formal risk assessments.
Instead, it promotes a risk-based approach and suggests that,
rather than trying to precisely measure risk, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> focus on
generally assessing and managing risks. This approach is similar to
that used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied.
Similarly, the concept of holding program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable
underlies the existing federal process for accrediting systems for
use. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accreditation</ENAMEX> is detailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Information</ENAMEX>
Processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Standards Publication 102</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guideline for Computer</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Certification</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Accreditation</ENAMEX>, which was published in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX>, accreditation is "the formal authorization
by the management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> for system operation and an explicit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acceptance</ENAMEX> of risk." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> update to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Circular A-130</ENAMEX>, Appendix
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, provides similar guidance, specifying that a management
official should authorize in writing the use of each system before
beginning or significantly changing use of the system. "By
authorizing processing in a system, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> accepts the risks
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with it."

Managing the increased risks associated with a highly
interconnected computing environment demands increased central
coordination to ensure that weaknesses in one organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s
systems do not place the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s information assets
at undue risk. Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied had adopted
this view and, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>, primarily since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, had
established a central security management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> or reoriented an
existing central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to facilitate and oversee the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s information security activities. As such, the
central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> served as the focal point for coordinating activities
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> segments of the risk management cycle.
As discussed in the previous section on risk analysis, the
central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> served primarily as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>
to the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, and, thus, they generally did not have the
ability to independently dictate information security practices.
However, most possessed considerable "clout" across their
organizations due largely to the support they received from their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. In this regard, their views
were

sought and respected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>' business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>.
The following case example describes how one organization
strengthened its central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and reoriented its
focus.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Focal Point</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, realizing that security was an essential element of its
efforts to innovatively use information technology, a major
manufacturer significantly reorganized and strengthened its central
information security function. Prior to the reorganization, a
central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> concentrated on
mainframe security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and had little interaction with
the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Since then, the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has grown to
include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who manage the security of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) decentralized computer operations, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) Internet use. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> participates in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s strategic planning efforts and in the early stages of
software development projects to ensure that security implications
of these efforts are addressed. In this regard, it serves as a
communications conduit between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and the information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who design, build, and implement new
applications.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> possess a variety of technical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and have specific information security responsibilities,
such as developing policy, maintaining the firewall that protects
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s network from unauthorized intrusions, or
supporting security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> assigned to individual business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, because of the shift in the
central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s responsibilities, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had to
change their mind-set from a staff <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to a service
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. They had to be willing to work with business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
to enable rather than to control business operations."
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Practice 5: Designate</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Group</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Carry Out Key</ENAMEX>
Activities
Overall, the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> served as (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) catalysts for
ensuring that information security risks were considered in both
planned and ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) central resources for advice
and expertise to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> throughout their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) a
conduit for keeping top management informed about security-related
issues and activities affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. In addition,
these central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were able to achieve some efficiencies and
increase consistency in the implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
security program by performing tasks centrally that might otherwise
be performed by multiple individual business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
Specific activities performed by central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> differed
somewhat, primarily because they relied to a varying extent on
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> in subordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and on
other organizationally separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, such as disaster recovery
or emergency response <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. Examples of the most common activities
carried out by central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are described below.
Developing and adjusting organizationwide policies and guidance,
thus reducing redundant policy-related activities across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s central
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> recently revamped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s entire information
security manual and dedicated one staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> to maintaining
it.
Educating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> about current information
security risks and helping to ensure consistent understanding and
administration of policies through help-line telephone numbers,
presentations to business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, and written information
communicated electronically or through paper memos.
Initiating discussions on information security risks with
business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and conducting defined risk assessment
procedures.
Meeting periodically with senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to discuss the
security implications of new information technology uses being
considered.
Researching potential threats, vulnerabilities, and control
techniques and communicating this information to others in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> supplemented knowledge
gained from their own experiences by frequently perusing
professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>, alerts, and other information available
in print and through the Internet. Several mentioned the importance
of networking with outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Integrity Institute</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Security Forum</ENAMEX>, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum of Incident Response and Security</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teams</ENAMEX>, to broaden their knowledge. One senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security officer</ENAMEX>
noted, "Sharing information and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> is important. Many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> are becoming more willing to talk with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> security because they realize that, despite differing
missions and cultures, they all use similar technology and face
many of the same threats."
Monitoring various aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
security-related activities by testing controls, accounting for the
number and types of security incidents, and evaluating compliance
with policies. The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> often characterized these
evaluative activities as services to the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
Establishing a computer incident response capability, and, in
some cases, serving as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the emergency response <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>.
Assessing risks and identifying needed policies and controls for
general support systems, such as organizationwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> or
central data processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, that supported multiple business
units. For example, some central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> controlled all new
connections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, ensuring that the
connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> met minimum security requirements. Similarly,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was instrumental in acquiring a
strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> authentication system to help ensure that network use
could be reliably traced to the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Further, most
central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> oversaw Internet use.

Reviewing and testing the security features in both commercially
developed software that was being considered for use and internally
developed software prior to its being moved into production. For
example, the manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> reviewed all new
Internet related applications and had the authority to stop such
applications from going into production if minimum security
standards were not met. Similarly, the central information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> was required to approve all new
applications to indicate that risks had been adequately
considered.
Providing self-assessment tools to business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> so that they
could monitor their own security posture. For example, the
financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> provided business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> with
software tools and checklists so that they would assume
responsibility for identifying and correcting weaknesses rather
than depending on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to identify problems.

Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior Executives</ENAMEX>
Senior information security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> emphasized the importance
of being able to discuss security issues with senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>.
Several noted that, to be effective, these senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> had to
be in a position to act and effect change across organizational
divisions. The ability to independently voice security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> to
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> was viewed as important because such concerns
could often be at odds with business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>' and system
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>' desires to implement new computer applications quickly
and avoid controls that would impede efficiency, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> friendliness,
and convenience. This ability to elevate significant security
concerns to higher management levels helped ensure that risks were
thoroughly understood and that decisions as to whether such risks
should be tolerated were carefully considered before final
decisions were made.
The organizational positions of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> varied. Most
were located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX> levels below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX> (CIO).
However, the groups reporting directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> or to an even
more senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> viewed this as an advantage because it
provided them greater independence. Several others said that,
despite their lower organizational position, they felt free to
contact their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> and other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> when important
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> issues arose, and they were relatively unrestrained by the
need to "go through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>." Some noted that senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> frequently called them to discuss security issues. For
example, at the nonbank financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, the senior security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> was organizationally placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> levels below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>, but
she met independently with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every quarter</TIMEX>. Also, during
the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months of 1997</TIMEX>, she had met twice with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX>, at his request, to discuss
the security implications of new applications.
In contrast, several federal information security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told
us that they felt that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were placed too low in
the organizational structure to be effective and that they had
little or no opportunity to discuss information security issues
with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> and other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.
Rather than depend on the personal interest of individual senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied had established
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">senior-level</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> to ensure that information technology
issues, including information security, received appropriate
attention. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>'s central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had created
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> of respected university technical and policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to
discuss and build consensus about the importance of certain
information security issues reported to senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, thus
lending weight and credibility to concerns raised by the central
security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.

Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Designate Dedicated Funding</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff</ENAMEX>
Unlike many federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> we studied had
defined budgets, which gave them the ability to plan and set goals
for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s information security program. At a
minimum, these budgets covered central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> salaries and training
and security hardware and software. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, business
units could supplement the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s resources in order to
increase the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s participation in high priority
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>. While all of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> permanently assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, comparing the size
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is of limited value because of wide variations in
the (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) sizes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) inherent
riskiness of their operations, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the additional support the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> received from other organizational components and from
numerous subordinate security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>.
In particular, no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were alike regarding the extent of
support they received from other organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. For example,
the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> relied on a security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> in each of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> regional business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-member central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> relied on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> parttime information
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinators</ENAMEX> at various levels within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Some
central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> relied heavily on technical assistance located in
another organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, while others had significant technical
expertise among their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and, thus, were much more involved
in directly implementing and testing controls.
Despite these differences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key characteristics were common
to each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) information security
responsibilities had been clearly defined for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> involved
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) dedicated staff resources had been provided to carry out
these responsibilities. The following table summarizes the details
on the size and structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>' information

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placement and Staffing of Eight Central Information Security</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Groups Practice 8</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enhance Staff Professionalism</ENAMEX> and
Technical Skills

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had taken steps to ensure that personnel
involved in various aspects of their information security programs
had the skills and knowledge they needed. In addition, they
recognized that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> expertise had to be frequently updated to
keep abreast of ongoing changes in threats, vulnerabilities,
software, security techniques, and security monitoring tools.
Further, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were striving to increase the
professional stature of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in order to gain respect from
others in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and attract competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to
security-related positions.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Update Skills</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knowledge of Security Managers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Specialists</ENAMEX>
The training emphasis for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in the central security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management groups</ENAMEX>, many of whom came to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with
significant technical expertise, was on keeping staff skills and
knowledge current. This was accomplished primarily through
attendance at technical conferences and specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> on
topics such as the security features of new software, as well as
networking with other security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and reviewing the
latest technical literature and bulletins. To maximize the value of
expenditures on external training and events, one central group
required staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who attended these events to brief others in
the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on what they had learned.
In an effort to significantly upgrade the expertise of
information security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in its various business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, the
central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at the financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> had recently
arranged for an outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> to provide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 weeks</TIMEX> of training for
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The training, which is planned to take place in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-week</TIMEX> increments throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, is expected to entail a
broad range of security-related topics, including general
information security, encryption, access control, and how to build
a better working relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>'s technical
information systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
Citing an emerging trend, the senior information security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> had also started to create information security career
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paths</ENAMEX> and stress professional certification for security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>. In particular, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were encouraging
their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Certified Information Systems Security</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professionals</ENAMEX> (CISSP)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5 One</NUMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> noted that security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>
5The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CISSP</ENAMEX> certification was established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Systems Security Certification Consortium</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consortium</ENAMEX> was established as a joint effort of several information
security-related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Systems</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Association</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Security Institute</ENAMEX>, to
develop a certification program for information security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.

also needed excellent communication skills if they were to
effectively fulfill their roles as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> and facilitators for
business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who were less technically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> regarding
computers and telecommunications.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Educate System Administrators</ENAMEX>
Increasing the expertise of system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> presented
different challenges. System <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> are important because
they generally perform <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> security functions, such as
creating new system user accounts, issuing new passwords, and
implementing new software. These tasks must be completed properly
and promptly or controls, such as passwords and related access
restrictions, will not provide the level of protection intended. In
addition, system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> are the first line of defense
against security intrusions and are generally in the best position
to notice unusual activity that may indicate an intrusion or other
security incident. However, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied, as at
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, security is often a collateral duty, rather than
a full-time job, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> assigned frequently have
limited technical expertise. As a result, the effectiveness of
individual system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> in maintaining security controls
and spotting incidents is likely to vary.
To enhance the technical skills of their security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>
and help ensure that all of them had the minimal skills needed,
most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had established special training sessions for
them. For example,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> required new security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> to spend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
to 5 days
in training with the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, depending on their
technical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX>, before they were granted authority to perform specific
functions on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, such as controlling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' access rights;
the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> held annual
technical
conferences for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>'s systems <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> and
engaged
professional training <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to offer on-campus training
at very
reduced rates; and
the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> held a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biannual</TIMEX> conference for systems
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrators</ENAMEX>
that included sessions related to their information security
responsibilities.


Attract and Keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Skills</ENAMEX>
Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> cited maintaining or increasing the technical
expertise among their security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> as a major challenge, largely
due to the high demand
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX> Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>
for information technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in the job market. In
response, several said they offered higher salaries and special
benefits to attract and keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert staff</ENAMEX>. For example, the
financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> provided competitive pay based on
surveys of industry pay levels, attempted to maintain a challenging
work environment, and provided flexible work schedules and
telecommuting opportunities that allowed most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to work
at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 day</TIMEX> a week. In addition, provisions were made for staff
to do the type of work they preferred, such as software testing
versus giving presentations.
Organizations relied on both internally and externally developed
and presented training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, sometimes engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> or
others to assist. For example, the state information security
office above the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> worked with an information security
professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to provide a relatively low-cost
statewide training conference. The state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> provided
meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and administrative support while the professional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> used its professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> to obtain knowledgeable
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>.


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> viewed information security policies as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> of their information security programs and the basis for
adopting specific procedures and technical controls. As with any
area of operations, written policies are the primary mechanism by
which management communicates its views and requirements to its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, and business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. For information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>, as with other types of internal controls, these views and
requirements generally flow directly from risk considerations, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in the management cycle depicted above.
As discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, our discussions with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> focused on their methods for developing and
supporting policies and guidelines. We did not discuss the specific
controls they had implemented due to the proprietary and often
highly technical nature of this information.
Practice <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">9: Link Policies to Business Risks</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> stressed the importance of up-to-date policies
that made sense to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and others who were expected to understand
them. Many senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security managers</ENAMEX> told us that prior to the
recent strengthening of their security programs, their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s information security policies had been neglected and
out-of-date, thus failing to address significant risks associated
with their current interconnected computing environment. As a
result, developing a comprehensive set of policies was one of their
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> steps in establishing an effective corporatewide security
program. In addition, they emphasized the importance of adjusting
policies continually to respond to newly identified risks or areas
of misunderstanding. For example,
At the financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>, the central security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> routinely
analyzed the causes of security weaknesses identified by
management and
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> in order to identify policy and related control
deficiencies.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> had recently developed more explicit policies on
system
administrator responsibilities in recognition of the critical
role of system
administration in a distributed environment.
The manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had recently drafted policies on
security
incident response after an incident had exposed shortfalls in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s
guidance in this area.
A relatively new risk area receiving particular attention in
organizational policies was user behavior. Many policies are
implemented and, to some extent, enforced by technical controls,
such as logical access controls that prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from
reading or altering data in an unauthorized manner. However, many
information security risks cannot be adequately mitigated with
technical controls because they are a function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> behavior. In
a networked environment, these risks are magnified because a
problem on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> computer can affect an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of computers
within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> and because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are likely to have easier access
to larger amounts of data and the ability to communicate quickly
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of others. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> may accidentally
disclose sensitive information to a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> through
electronic mail or introduce damaging viruses that are subsequently
transmitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of computers. In
addition, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> may feel no compunction against browsing
sensitive organizational computer files or inappropriate Internet
sites if there is no clear guidance on what types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> behavior
are acceptable.
To address these risks, many of which did not exist prior to
extensive use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, electronic mail, and the Internet, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> had begun placing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX> Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>
more emphasis on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> behavior in their policies and guidelines.
For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>'s policies went beyond the traditional
warnings against password disclosure by including prohibitions
against a variety of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> actions. These included
misrepresenting their identity in electronic communications and
conducting and promoting personal commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> on the
network. The senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security officer</ENAMEX> at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> noted
that, when rules such as this are aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, it is especially
important that they be stated in clearly understandable, relatively
nontechnical language. The security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> at the computer vendor
said that because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s information security policies
emphasized user behavior, they were included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> code of conduct.
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Distinguish Between Policies and Guidelines</ENAMEX>
"Detailed guidelines are an important supplement to the official
policies because they educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and serve as an awareness
tool."
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at a prominent financial institution
A common technique for making organizational information
security policies more useful was to divide them into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> broad
segments: concise high-level policies and more detailed information
referred to as guidelines or standards. Policies generally outlined
fundamental requirements that top management considered to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imperative</ENAMEX>, while guidelines provided more detailed rules for
implementing the broader policies. Guidelines, while encouraged,
were not considered to be mandatory for all business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
Distinguishing between organizational policies and guidelines
provided several benefits. It allowed senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to
emphasize the most important elements of information security
policy, provided some flexibility to unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, made policies
easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to understand, and, in some cases, reduced the
amount of formal review needed to finalize updated policies.


<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guidelines Can Serve As An Educational Tool</ENAMEX>
Several security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said that short policies that
emphasized the most important aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> security
concerns were more likely to be read and understood than voluminous
and detailed policies. However, they noted that more detailed
guidelines often provided answers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>' questions and
served as a tool for educating subordinate security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and
others who wanted a more thorough understanding of good security
practices.
For example, the utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had distilled the fundamental
components of its information protection policies into less than
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> page of text. This narrative (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) stated that "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information</ENAMEX> is a
corporate asset . . . . Information must be protected according to
its sensitivity, criticality and value, regardless of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> on
which it is stored, the manual or automated systems that process

responsibilities of information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>, custodians, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
defined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> data classification categories,
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) stated that each business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> should develop an
information protection program to implement these policies. The
policy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX> Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
statement then referred the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>-page reference guide
that provided definitions, recommended guidelines and procedures,
explanatory discussions, and self-assessment questionnaires
designed to assist business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in understanding the need for the
policies and how they could be implemented.


Guidelines Provide for Flexibility
Although the latitude granted to business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> varied,
providing both policies and guidelines allowed business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to
tailor the guidelines to their own individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protection</ENAMEX> needs. It also reinforced the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>' sense
of ownership of their information assets.
For example, the large financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> had
divided its information security rules into "policies" and
"standards." Policies were mandatory, high-level requirements that,
with rare exception, had to be followed. An example of a policy was
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were required to use commercially developed software
rather than developing unique software inhouse. An example of a
standard at the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> was a prescribed minimum password
length. At this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, deviations from policies had to be
documented in a letter signed by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> of the business
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> requesting the deviation and the central information security
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>. However, deviations from standards required only
approval from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>. Such deviations were required
to be documented in a letter and, though not required, were usually
approved by the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. All deviations had to be
renewed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>: Support Policies Through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Security</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>
Generally, the central security management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were
responsible for developing written corporatewide policies in
partnership with business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>. In addition, the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> provided related
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explanations</ENAMEX>, guidance, and support to business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Several
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> noted that business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are much more likely
to support centrally developed policies if they clearly address
organizational needs and are practical to implement. For this
reason, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had developed mechanisms for involving
other organizational components in policy documentation.
Most often this involvement was in the form of reviews of policy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drafts</ENAMEX>. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> had established an information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> that included top university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>,
legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> affairs, faculty
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affairs</ENAMEX>, and internal audit to assist in the development and review
of policies.
The central security management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> played an important role
in ensuring that policies were consistently implemented by serving
as focal points for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> questions. By serving as a readily
available resource for organization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, they helped clear up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">misunderstandings</ENAMEX> and provided guidance on topics that were not
specifically addressed in written guidance.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had also made their policies available
through their computer networks so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> could readily access
the most up-to-date version whenever they needed to refer to them.
In addition, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> required <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to sign a statement
that they had read and understood the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s information
security policies. Generally, such statements were required from
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> at the time access to information resources was first
provided and from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> periodically, usually once a year. One
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> thought that requiring such signed statements
served as a useful technique for impressing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> the
importance of understanding organizational policies. In addition,
if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> was later involved in a security violation, the
statement served as evidence that he or she had been informed of
organizational policies. Additional techniques for communicating
information security policies are discussed in the next section on
promoting awareness.


"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Users</ENAMEX> are much more likely to support and comply with policies
if they clearly understand the purpose for the policies and their
responsibilities in regard to the policies."
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information</ENAMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for a state agency
User awareness is essential to successfully implementing
information security policies and ensuring that related controls
are working properly. Computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, and others with access to
information resources, cannot be expected to comply with policies
that they are not aware of or do not understand. Similarly, if they
are not aware of the risks associated with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
information resources, they may not understand the need for and
support compliance with policies designed to reduce risk. For this
reason, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> considered promoting awareness as an
essential element of the risk management cycle.
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Continually Educate Users and Others on Risks and</ENAMEX>
Related Policies
The central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had implemented ongoing awareness strategies
to educate all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who might affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
information security. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were primarily computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, who might be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>; or commercial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> took an even broader
view, targeting awareness efforts also at custodians and security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>, after a night security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> accidentally destroyed some
important data while playing games on a computer after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> focused their efforts on increasing everyone's
understanding of the risks associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
information and the related policies and controls in place to
mitigate those risks. Although these efforts were generally aimed
at encouraging policy compliance, the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security official</ENAMEX> at
the retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> emphasized the importance of improving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>'
understanding of risks. She said that her central security group
had recognized that policies, no matter how detailed, could never
address every scenario that might lead to a security incident. As a
result, her overarching philosophy regarding awareness efforts was
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> who thoroughly understood the risks were better equipped
to use good judgment when faced with a potential security breach.
For example, such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were less likely to be tricked into
disclosing sensitive information or passwords.
This last point highlights one of the most important reasons for
sensitizing computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to the importance of
information security. Users disclosing sensitive information or
passwords in response to seemingly innocent requests from strangers
either over the phone or in person can provide intruders easy
access to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s information and systems. Such
techniques, often referred to as "social engineering," exploit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>' tendencies to be cooperative and helpful, instead of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">guarded</ENAMEX>, careful, and suspicious, when information is requested.
Without adequate awareness about the risks involved in disclosing
sensitive information, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> may volunteer information which can
allow an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intruder</ENAMEX> to circumvent otherwise well-designed access
controls.
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>: Use Attention-Getting and User-Friendly
Techniques
To get their message across, the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> used a
variety of training and promotional techniques to make
organizational policies readily accessible, educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> on these
policies, and keep security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> in the forefront of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>'
minds. Techniques used included
intranet websites that communicated and explained information
security
related policies, standards, procedures, alerts, and special
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">notes</ENAMEX>;
awareness videos with enthusiastic endorsements from top
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> for
the security program to supplement basic guidance, such as the
importance
of backing up files and protecting passwords;
interactive presentations by security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to various user
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to market
the services provided by the central information security group
and answer
user questions; and
security awareness day and products with security-related
slogans.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> avoided having once-a-year, one-size-fits-all
security briefings like those seen at many federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. The
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said that it was important to relate security
concerns to the specific risks faced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> in individual
business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and ensure that security was an everyday
consideration.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case Example</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinating Policy Development and Awareness</ENAMEX>
Activities
After experiencing a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, a
retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> assigned one of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to step up efforts
to promote employee awareness of information security risks and
related organizational policies. Since then, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s
responsibilities for information security policy development and
awareness, which had previously been handled on a part-time basis,
have evolved into a full-time "awareness <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> position" in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s response to a
minor incident involving the unintentional release of company
financial data illustrates the compatibility of these roles. To
reduce the chances of a similar incident, the awareness manager
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concurrently</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) coordinated the development of a policy describing
organizational data classification standards and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) developed a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brochure</ENAMEX> and guidelines to publicize the new standards and educate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on their implementation. By coordinating policy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and awareness activities in this manner, she helps
ensure that new risks and policies are communicated promptly and
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are periodically reminded of existing policies
through means such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> bulletins, an intranet web site, and
presentations to new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.


As with any type of business activity, information security
should be monitored and periodically reassessed to ensure that
policies continue to be appropriate and that controls are
accomplishing their intended purpose. Over time, policies and
procedures may become inadequate because of changes in threats,
changes in operations, or deterioration in the degree of
compliance. Periodic assessments or reports on activities can be a
valuable means of identifying areas of noncompliance, reminding
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of their responsibilities, and demonstrating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s
commitment to the security program.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied had recognized that monitoring
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> effectiveness and compliance with policies is a key step in
the cycle of managing information security. Accordingly, they
monitored numerous factors associated with their security programs,
and they used the results to identify needed improvements. They
used various techniques to do this, and several mentioned their
efforts to identify, evaluate, and implement new, more effective
tools as they become available. Such tools include software that
can be used to automatically monitor control effectiveness and
information systems activity. In addition, several of the security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> expressed interest in improving their ability to more
precisely measure the costs and benefits of security-related
activities so that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> could better determine which
controls and activities were the most cost effective.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/AIMD</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Security Management</ENAMEX> Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monitor Factors</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affect Risk</ENAMEX> and Indicate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Effectiveness</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> focused their monitoring efforts primarily on
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) determining if controls were in place and operating as intended
to reduce risk and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) evaluating the effectiveness of the security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> in
communicatingpolicies, raising awareness levels, and reducing
incidents. As discussed below, these efforts included testing
controls, monitoring compliance with policies, analyzing security
incidents, and accounting for procedural accomplishments and other
indicators that efforts to promote awareness were effective.

Testing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Effectiveness of Controls</ENAMEX>
Directly testing control effectiveness was cited most often as
an effective way to determine if the risk reduction techniques that
had been agreed to were, in fact, operating effectively. In keeping
with their role as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> and facilitators, most of the security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said that they relied significantly on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> to test
controls. In these cases, the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> groups
kept track of audit findings related to information security and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s progress in implementing corrective actions.
However, several of the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> also performed
their own tests. For example, the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at the
university periodically ran a computer program designed to detect
network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vulnerabilities</ENAMEX> at various individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic</ENAMEX> departments
and reported weaknesses to department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>. A subsequent review
was performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months later</TIMEX> to determine if weaknesses had
been reduced. The central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> told us that she
considered the tests, which could be performed inexpensively by her
staff, a cost-effective way to evaluate this important aspect of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> and provide a service to the academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, which
were ultimately responsible for the security of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>'
information and operations.
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> periodically tested system and network
access controls by allowing designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to try to "break
into" their systems using the latest hacking techniques. This type
of testing is often referred to as penetration testing. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> performing the tests, which at various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
were internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>, student interns, or central
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, were encouraged to research and use hacking
instructions and tools available on the Internet or from other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> in order to simulate attacks from real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hackers</ENAMEX>. By allowing
such tests, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> could readily identify previously
unknown vulnerabilities and either eliminate them or make
adjustments in computer and network use to lessen the risks.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> had performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> tests of its disaster
recovery plan to identify and correct plan weaknesses. A recent
test was particularly effective because it involved a comprehensive
simulation of a real disaster. The test involved staging a surprise
"bomb scare" to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, who were unaware that the threat was
a pretense, to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> had
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evacuated</ENAMEX>, they were told that they were participating in a test,
that they were to assume that a bomb had actually destroyed their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workplace</ENAMEX>, and to proceed with emergency recovery plans. The test,
which was organized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s contingency planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
proved extremely successful in identifying plan weaknesses and in
dramatically sensitizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to the value of anticipating and
being prepared for such events.



<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monitoring Compliance With Policies and Guidelines</ENAMEX>
All of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> monitored compliance with
organizational policies to some extent. Much of this monitoring was
achieved through informal feedback to the central security group
from system <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> and others in other organizational
units. However, a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had developed more structured
mechanisms for such monitoring. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> company
developed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> reports on compliance with organizational
policies, such as the number of organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that had
tailored their own information protection policies as required by
corporate-level policy. Also, several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> said that they
had employed self-assessment tools, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Security</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Compliance Test</ENAMEX>," to compare their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>'s programs to preestablished criteria.


Accounting For and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analyzing Security Incidents</ENAMEX>
Keeping summary records of actual security incidents is one way
that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> can measure the frequency of various types of
violations as well as the damage suffered from these incidents.
Such records can provide valuable input for risk assessments and
budgetary decisions.
Although all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> kept at least informal records
on incidents, those that had formalized the process found such
information to be a valuable resource. For example, at the nonbank
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> kept records on
viruses detected and eradicated, including estimates of the cost of
potential damage to computer files that was averted by the use of
virus detection software. This information was then used to justify
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> budget requests when additional virus detection software was
needed. However, as discussed in the following case example, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university</ENAMEX> had developed the most comprehensive procedures for
accounting for and analyzing security incidents.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case Example: Developing an Incident Database</ENAMEX>
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>'s central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had developed a database
that served as a valuable management tool in monitoring problems,
reassessing risks, and determining how to best use limited
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to address the most significant information security
problems. The database accounted for the number of information
security incidents that had been reported, the types of incidents,
and actions taken to resolve each incident, including disciplinary
actions. At the time of our visit, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1997</TIMEX>, incidents were
categorized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> types, which generally pertained to the
negative effects of the violations. Examples included denial of
service, unauthorized access, data compromise, system damage,
copyright infringement, and unauthorized commercial activity.
By keeping such records, the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> could develop <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>
reports that showed increases and decreases in incident frequency,
trends, and the status of resolution efforts. This, in turn,
provided the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> a means of
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) identifying emerging problems, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) assessing the
effectiveness of current policiesand awareness efforts, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
determining the need for stepped up education or new controls to
address problem areas, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) monitoring the status of
investigative and disciplinary actions to help ensure that no
individual violation was inadvertently forgotten and that
violations were handled consistently.
The means of maintaining the database and the details that it
contained had changed as the number of reported incidents at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university</ENAMEX> had grown--from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month in 1993</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 50</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1997</TIMEX>--and as the database's value as a
management tool became more apparent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX> originally maintained
in a paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">logbook</ENAMEX> had been transferred to a personal computer, and
information on follow-up actions had recently been expanded.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>'s senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security officer</ENAMEX> noted that the database
could be augmented to provide an even broader range of security
management information. For example, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> did not
develop data on the actual cost of incidents, such as the cost of
recovering from virus infections, the database could be used to
compile such information, which would be useful in measuring the
cost of security lapses and in determining how much to spend on
controls to reduce such lapses.



Monitoring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Effectiveness of the Central Security Management</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>
Several of the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had developed measures of
their own activities, outputs, and expertise as an indication of
their effectiveness. Examples of these items included
the number of calls from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, indicating knowledge of and
respect for
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>;
the number of security-related briefings and training sessions
presented;
the number of risk assessments performed;
the number of security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and systems <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> who
were
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Certified Information System Security Professionals</ENAMEX>; and
the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and conferences held or attended.


Emerging Interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">More Precisely Measuring Cost and</ENAMEX>
Benefits
Several of the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> expressed an interest in
developing better measurement capabilities so that they could more
precisely measure the ultimate benefits and drawbacks of
security-related policies and controls--that is, the positive and
negative affects of information security on business operations.
However, they said that such measurements would be difficult
because it is costly to do the research and recordkeeping necessary
to develop information on (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the full cost of controls--both the
initial cost and operational inefficiencies associated with the
controls--and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the full cost of incidents or problems resulting
from inadequate controls. Further, as discussed previously
regarding risk assessment, actual reductions in risk cannot be
precisely quantified because sufficient data on risk factors are
not available.
In an effort to more thoroughly explore this topic, we expanded
our discussions beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that were the
primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of our study by requesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Security</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> to informally poll its most active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> on this
subject. We also discussed assessment techniques with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST</ENAMEX>. Although we identified no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that had made
significant progress in applying such measures, we found that more
precisely measuring the positive and negative effects of security
on business operations is an area of developing interest among many
information security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>. For this reason, improved data and
measurement techniques may be available in the future.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> Accountable
Although monitoring, in itself, may encourage compliance with
information security policies, the full benefits of monitoring are
not achieved unless results are used to improve the security
program. Analyzing the results of monitoring efforts provides
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> and business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> a means of


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
reassessing previously identified risks, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) identifying
new problem areas,


(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
reassessing the appropriateness of existing controls and
security-relatedactivities, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) identifying the need for new
controls, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) redirecting subsequent monitoring efforts. For
example, the central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> at the utility redirected its
training programs in response to information security weaknesses
reported by its internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>. Similarly, security specialists
at the manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> recently visited one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s
overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to assist in resolving security weaknesses
identified by internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>. The previously cited example of
using records on virus incidents to determine the need for
virus-detection software also illustrates this point.


Results can also be used to hold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable for their
information security responsibilities. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> had
developed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> reporting mechanisms to summarize the status of
security-related efforts. However, the financial services
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corporation</ENAMEX> provided the best example of how periodic reports of
results can be used to hold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable for understanding,
as well as reducing, the information security risks to their
business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. A description of this process is provided in the
following case example.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case Example: Measuring Control Effectiveness and Management</ENAMEX>
Awareness
At a major financial services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are expected
to know what their security problems are and to have plans in place
to resolve them. To help ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> fulfill this
responsibility, they are provided self-assessment tools that they
can use to evaluate the information security aspects of their
operations. When weaknesses are discovered, the business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
are expected to either improve compliance with existing policies or
consult with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>'s security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> regarding the
feasibility of implementing new policies or control techniques.
Ratings based on audit findings serve as an independent measure
of control effectiveness and management awareness. At the start of
every audit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> ask the pertinent business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> what
weaknesses exist in their operations and what corrective actions
they have deemed necessary and have planned. After audit work is
complete, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> compare their findings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s
original assertions to see if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> was generally aware of all
of the weaknesses prior to the audit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> then develop two
ratings on a scale of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 5</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> rating to indicate the
effectiveness of information security controls and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> rating
to indicate the level of management awareness. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX>
discover serious, but previously unrecognized weaknesses, the
management awareness rating will be lowered. However, if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">auditor</ENAMEX> finds no additional weaknesses, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> will receive a
good awareness rating, even if controls need to be
strengthened.
These ratings are forwarded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">directors</ENAMEX>, where they can be used as performance measures.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>'s central security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, the bank
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX>'s goal is for all business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to have favorable ratings
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</NUMEX>) in both categories. Such a rating system provides not only
a measure of performance and awareness, but it also places primary
responsibility for information security with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> whose
operations depend on it. Further, it recognizes the importance of
identifying weaknesses and the risk they present, even when they
cannot be completely eliminated.
Practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Be Alert to New Monitoring Tools and Techniques</ENAMEX>
The security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> said that they were constantly looking
for new tools to test the security of their computerized
operations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> noted that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
had implemented new, more sophisticated, software tools for
monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">network vulnerabilities</ENAMEX>. However, several security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said that the development of automated monitoring tools is
lagging behind the introduction of new computer and network
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> and that this has impaired their efforts to detect
incidents, especially unauthorized intrusions. Similarly, as
discussed previously, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> are looking for practical techniques
for more precisely measuring the value of security controls and
obtaining better data on risk factors. In such an environment, it
is essential that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> keep abreast of
developing techniques and tools and the latest information about
system vulnerabilities and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> ensure they have
the resources to do this.
Several security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> told us that, in addition to reading
current professional literature, their involvement with
professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> was a valuable means of learning about
the latest monitoring tools and research efforts. Examples of such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Security Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems Security Association</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum of Incident Response</ENAMEX> and
Security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teams</ENAMEX>, and less formal discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of security
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> associated with individual industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. Several
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> said that by participating in our study, they
hoped to gain insights on how to improve their information security
programs.






Conclusion
"We are on the verge of a revolution that is just as profound as
the change in the economy that came with the industrial revolution.
Soon electronic networks will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to transcend the
barriers of time and distance and take advantage of global markets
and business opportunities not even imaginable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, opening up a
new world of economic possibility and progress."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Gore, Jr.</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> report, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A Framework</ENAMEX> For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Global Electronic Commerce</ENAMEX>
To achieve the benefits offered by the new era of computer
interconnectivity, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, like other
organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, must find ways to address
the associated security implications. Individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">security</ENAMEX> controls
and monitoring tools will change as technology advances, and new
risks are likely to emerge. For this reason, it is essential that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> such as federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> establish management
frameworks for dealing with these changes on an ongoing basis.
Developing an information security program that adheres to the
basic principles outlined in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and most basic
step that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> can take to build an effective security
program. In this regard, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> must continually (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) explore and
assess information security risks to business operations, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
determine what policies, standards, and controls are worth
implementing to reduce these risks, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) promote awareness and
understanding among program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, and systems
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) assess compliance and control effectiveness. As with other
types of internal controls, this is a cycle of activity, not an
exercise with a defined beginning and end.
By instituting such a management framework, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can
strengthen their current security posture, facilitate future system
and process improvement efforts, and more confidently take
advantage of technology advances.
