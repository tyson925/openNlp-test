(i)
Cost-benefit analysis

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> has assessed the impact of the final rule and finds that
it will decrease payments to home health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.06 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1998</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.14 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.

Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act, 5 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 603-605, 607</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">609</NUMEX>


In the preamble to the final rule, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> discusses, in the form
of a combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
Analysis, the effect of the final rule on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. The small
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> include most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, and health care
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, either by virtue of their non-profit status or by having
revenues of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 million</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HCFA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that it is clear that the rule will have a
significant impact on a substantial number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> since
the aggregate per-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> limitation will reduce payments by
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 9 percent</NUMEX>.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that it has examined the options for lessening
the burden on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, since the statute does not allow for
any exceptions to the aggregate per-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> limitation based on
the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, no regulatory relief can be provided for
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532-1535</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HCFA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that the final rule will not impose a federal
intergovernmental or private sector mandate of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> or
more, as defined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.

(iv) Other relevant information or requirements under acts and
executive orders
Administrative Procedure <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">551 et seq.</TIMEX>
This rule was issued as a final rule with comment period because
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> found "good cause" that
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> and comment were impracticable. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 553</NUMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). The
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Balanced Budget Act of 1997</ENAMEX>, enacted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 5, 1997</TIMEX>, required the
per-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiary</ENAMEX> limitations be established by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1, 1998</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX>,
among other calculations, had to perform a special data collection
from its fiscal intermediaries to obtain cost report data and
generate an unduplicated census count from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Claims</ENAMEX>
History <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Analytical File</ENAMEX>.
For the same reason regarding the statutorily mandated effective
date, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> delay in the effective date of a rule required by
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 553</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) was also waived.
Since there was neither a proposed rule nor the receipt of
public comments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> has properly invoked the exception found at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 808</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> delay in the effective date of a
major rule normally required under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Review</ENAMEX> Act
subtitle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Regulatory Enforcement</ENAMEX> Fairness Act
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3501-3520</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> notes in the preamble that the final rule does not have any
collections of information that would be subject to review by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction</ENAMEX>
Act.
Statutory authorization for the rule
The final rule was promulgated pursuant to the authority in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 1861</ENAMEX>(v)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> Act (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â</ENAMEX>§
1395x(v)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>)) and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 4207 of Pub</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. 101508</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â</ENAMEX>§
1395x (note)).
