The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Governors</ENAMEX> has concluded that the final rule will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small

regulatory flexibility analysis have been prepared and are included
in the notice of proposed rulemaking and the final rule notice,
respectively, as required by sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603 and 604</NUMEX>. The analyses
comply with the informational requirements of the sections
including the number and sizes of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> affected and
the alternatives considered to reduce the burden on small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entities</ENAMEX>.
The final analysis points out that the expedited
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">application/</ENAMEX>notice procedures and the removal of unnecessary and
outmoded regulatory restriction will be particularly helpful to
small bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.

The preamble to the final rule discusses the information
collection requirements of the final rule, the reason for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collections</ENAMEX>, and burden estimates.
The various information collections have already been approved
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> under the act and issued OMB
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> numbers which are listed in the preamble.
The preamble points out that the number of responses and burden
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> associated with the collections are greatly reduced because
of the streamlined procedures now available to bank holding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> under the final rule. The total cost of complying with
the information collections prior to the issuance of the final rule
was estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,743,130</NUMEX>. It is estimated that the reduction
in responses and burden <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> will result in a savings of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,273,975</NUMEX> or a new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> cost of compliance of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,469,155</NUMEX>.
