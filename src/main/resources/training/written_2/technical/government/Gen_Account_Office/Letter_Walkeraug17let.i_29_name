The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
Dear Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>:
Pursuant to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 716</NUMEX>(b), I am submitting this report
because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chair of the National Energy Policy</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Group</ENAMEX> (NEPDG), has not provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting</ENAMEX>
Office (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>) with access to certain records relating to the process
by which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy Policy</ENAMEX> was developed. I requested
these records in writing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18, 2001</TIMEX>, in accordance with
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 716</ENAMEX>. Despite repeated attempts, we have been unable to
resolve this dispute.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> have asserted that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> lacks the statutory authority to examine the activities of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>, recognizing only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s authority to audit its financial
transactions. They have also asserted that our examination would
unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of the executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branch</ENAMEX>. In addition to the arguments previously advanced by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> and addressed in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 22</TIMEX>
letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enclosure</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX> letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> asserts that the
study is not authorized by statute because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is limited to
looking at the Æ’resultsâ‰ˆ of programs and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> does not have a
right of access to documents because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> is not
included under the term Æ’agencyâ‰ˆ used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s statute.
As discussed below, we strongly disagree with the Vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PresidentÂ«s</ENAMEX> positions. Disclosing the records we are seeking would
not reveal communications between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>
and would not unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of
the executive branch. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has ample authority to
conduct this review, and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> has been recognized by
various presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administrations</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. Finally,
neither the plain meaning of the statute nor the legislative
history supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s interpretation of the terms
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Æ’resultsâ‰ˆ and Æ’agency.</ENAMEX>â‰ˆ
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> as an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislative branch</ENAMEX>, assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in
exercising its responsibilities under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Constitution</ENAMEX> to oversee,
investigate, and legislate. In order to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
carry out their role and evaluate the process used to develop the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy Policy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> needs selected factual and
non-deliberative records that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, as Chair of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>, or others representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>, are in a position to
provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. The records we are requesting will assist the review
of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> spent public funds, how it carried out its
activities, and whether applicable law was followed<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descriptions</ENAMEX>
of the records we are requesting, our efforts to obtain them, and
our statutory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> are summarized below.


<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Description of Records Requested</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> authorized this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> study
based on a request from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Representatives</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D. Dingell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Waxman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ranking</ENAMEX> Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Committee on</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy and Commerce</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Committee on Government Reform</ENAMEX>,
respectively. Our study is narrowly focused to answer the question,
Æ’What process did the NEPDG use to develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy</ENAMEX>
Policy?â‰ˆ To answer that question, we have requested documents that
provide the following information:


â€¢
Who was present at each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> meetings conducted
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>?


â€¢
What are the names of the professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> assigned to
provide support to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>?


â€¢
Who did each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> (including the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chair</ENAMEX>) and its support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> meet with to gather
information for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy Policy</ENAMEX>, including the date,
subject, and location of the meetings?


â€¢
What direct and indirect costs were incurred in
developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy Policy</ENAMEX>?


In communications with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX> prior to the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX> letter, we offered to eliminate our earlier request for
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> and notes and for the information presented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>. Even though we are legally entitled to this
information, as a matter of comity, we are scaling back the records
we are requesting to exclude these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> items of information<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>
Furthermore, we have repeatedly emphasized that we are flexible in
how information is provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. Despite these and other efforts
on our part to resolve the impasse, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> have shown no interest in reaching any
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accommodation</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
For example, the information on who was present at each of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> meetings conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> can be used to confirm that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of the federal government
attended the meetings and thus rule out the possibility that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> Act (FACA) is applicable to meetings of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX> exempts from its provisions those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>
composed wholly of full-time federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
Similarly, information on whom individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and staff
met with and the dates and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of the meetings would be
relevant in confirming that meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> did
not trigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FACA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> app. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>).
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
These items of information are described in paragraph 3(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) and
(e), and paragraph 4(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) and
(e) of our letter of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18, 2001</TIMEX>.


Efforts to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obtain Records</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> began its efforts to conduct this review on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 7</TIMEX> by
following our standard practice of calling a designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> to
set up an initial meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. (See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enclosure</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> for a
chronology of our efforts to obtain the records.) Numerous phone
calls did not produce a meeting date. Instead, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 16</TIMEX>, the Vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PresidentÂ«s Counsel</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> a letter questioning the
appropriateness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s review, expressing reluctance to supply
the information requested and asking for a statement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> to conduct the review. We responded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1</TIMEX> that the
request was consistent with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> and asked for access to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> containing the information requested.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 7</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX> again questioned GAOÂ«s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> to conduct this review, and in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 22</TIMEX> reply we
explained our statutory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in detail. We also repeated our
request for information relevant to our study. Subsequent to our
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 22</TIMEX> letter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have engaged in numerous
conversations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>. However,
in these conversations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> have
focused entirely on their view that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> lacks authority to conduct
this review, rather than on reaching an accommodation.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18, 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> issued a letter to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> in his capacity as Chair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>, under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 716</NUMEX>(b), requesting access to certain records relating to
our study, restating our authority for inspecting the records, and
the reason for our inspection<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> did not respond
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> with a description of the records withheld and the reasons
for withholding them as required by the statute. Instead, he sent
letters to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, to inform them of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s actions and to serve as a response to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18</TIMEX> letter. In these letters, he asserted that I
Æ’exceededâ‰ˆ my Æ’lawful authorityâ‰ˆ by undertaking this study. He also
refused to acknowledge GAOÂ«s basic statutory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> and
asserts that if the Æ’Comptroller GeneralÂ«s misconstruction of the
statutesâ‰ˆ were to prevail, Æ’his conduct would unconstitutionally
interfere with the functioning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Branch</ENAMEX>.â‰ˆ
When records are not made available to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> within a reasonable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the provisions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 716</NUMEX>(b) establish mechanisms for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution of GAO</ENAMEX> access-to-records problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 716</ENAMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
provides that when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is not given access to records within a
reasonable time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> may make a written request
for such records to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> head. The official then has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 days</TIMEX>
to respond and the response is required to describe the record
withheld and the reason the record is being withheld. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> is not
given an opportunity to inspect the record during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX> period,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> may file a report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, and other executive branch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty days</TIMEX> after
filing the report, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> may bring a civil action
in the district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> to require the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> involved to produce the withheld
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>.
As this letter makes clear, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, I have broad discretion to conduct audits, investigations,
and examinations of executive branch activities either at the
request of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> or on my own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, we do not
agree that disclosure of the limited factual and non-deliberative
information we are seeking, such as the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> at
meetings, would Æ’unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning
of the executive branch.â‰ˆ In support of this proposition, the Vice
PresidentÂ«s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX> letter states that Æ’preservation of the
ability of the executive branch to function effectively requires
respecting the confidentiality of communications among a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>,
a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> and
others.â‰ˆ However, as we have made clear in several discussions with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, we are not asking for any
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PresidentÂ«s</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>. We are simply asking for facts that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, as Chair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>, or others representing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, would be in a position to provide to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>. These include
the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendees</ENAMEX>, dates and locations, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of
the meetings.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> has also expressed concern regarding certain
requests for his personal schedule. We understand and appreciate
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> regarding release of his personal
schedule. As a result, we have made clear to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> that we are not seeking a copy of his calendar or
information on meetings held other than in his capacity as Chair of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>. As we have emphasized, we are seeking certain factual
information on meetings the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> held in his capacity as
Chair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>.
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> did not use the term Æ’Executive
Privilegeâ‰ˆ in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX> letter, his assertion that providing
these facts would unconstitutionally interfere with the executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branch</ENAMEX> and his focus on confidentiality of communications use the
same language and reasoning as assertions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Privilege</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
In our view, the information that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> seeks is not protected by
Executive Privilege. As noted above, the information we are seeking
is factual and non-deliberative in nature. In fact, the Vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PresidentÂ«s Counsel</ENAMEX> has already informed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Committee on</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy and Commerce</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Committee on Government Reform</ENAMEX>,
that the meetings the support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had
were to gather information relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDGÂ</ENAMEX>«s work and were
not deliberative in
The right to invoke Executive Privilege rests with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Presidents</ENAMEX> have had different procedures for
asserting it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, for example, required the agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, if a substantial question was raised, to notify and consult
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House CounselÂ«s Office</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> would decide whether to assert the privilege. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> modified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ReaganÂ</ENAMEX>«s policy by requiring the agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to directly notify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX> was to seek an accommodation, and if unsuccessful, to
consult with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>. Again, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> determined
whether to invoke the privilege.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
nature. Even where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> has made a formal claim of
Executive Privilege, which is not the case here, federal courts
have held that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> and legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> have a duty
to attempt to reach a mutual accommodation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> As we have stated
earlier, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> have declined to
discuss reaching any accommodation.
The information we are seeking is of the type that has been
commonly provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> spanning several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">administrations</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, in prior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reviews of working
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, we have received information
on participation by outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. Most recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reviewed
activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House China Trade Relations Working Group</ENAMEX>,
which was established at the request of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> in the
exercise of his <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Constitutional</ENAMEX> powers. In this review, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> was
provided <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of documents including copies of e-mails and
other information identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> membersÂ« contacts with outside
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Previously, at the request of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican Ranking</ENAMEX> Minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Committee on</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Operations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> reviewed activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClintonÂ«s Task Force on Health Care Reform</ENAMEX> and was provided with an
extensive listing of working group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> drawn from the
government and from outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Moreover, some members
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> have already provided us with information identical in
kind to the type of information we are seeking from the Vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> in his capacity as Chair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> and from NEPDG
staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secretaries of Energy and Interior</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>, have
provided us with information concerning who they met with to
develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy Policy</ENAMEX>, when the meetings occurred,
where they occurred, and what the general topics were.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ«s Basic Audit Authority</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s basic authority stems from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Budget and Accounting Act</ENAMEX>
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX>, which, as discussed below, provides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> with broad and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> authority to investigate all matters relating to the
use of public money. Succeeding legislation affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> has generally served to emphasize the role of review and

number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> programs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has by
necessity become more dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> assistance in fulfilling its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oversight</ENAMEX> and legislative responsibilities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> not only provides
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> with essential information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> programs, but
also, uniquely, exercises statutory authority to
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">continuedâ€¦</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, headed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX>, is a principal means by
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislative branch</ENAMEX> conducts oversight of executive
programs and activities<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>
Notwithstanding the broad authority vested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX>
letter again questioned GAOÂ«s basic authority to do this review.
However, as we explained in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 22, 2001</TIMEX>, letter to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, our inquiry is authorized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">712 and 717</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 712</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) authorizes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to investigate
"all matters related to the receipt, disbursement, and use of
public money," and there is no doubt that public money was used to
fund the activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counsel</ENAMEX> has asserted that
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 712</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) limits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s audit authority to financial
transactions. As we explained in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 22</TIMEX> letter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CounselÂ</ENAMEX>«s
narrow interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 712</ENAMEX> is inconsistent with the
language and legislative history of the statute, as well as years
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> practice. The statute extends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ«s</ENAMEX> audit authority to Æ’all
mattersâ‰ˆ related to the use of public money, not just costs of
activities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 717</ENAMEX>(b) also clearly authorizes this study. It provides
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> "shall evaluate the results of a
program or activity the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> carries out under existing law."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CounselÂ</ENAMEX>«s assertion that the phrase Æ’existing lawâ‰ˆ is limited
to statutes and excludes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> is unsupported. As we
explained in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 22</TIMEX> letter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX> failed to supply any
evidence from the statutory language, legislative history, or case
law to support the assertion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended the phrase
"existing law" to exclude the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>, the highest law of the
land.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX> letter noted that section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">717</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authorizes GAO</ENAMEX> to review the Æ’resultsâ‰ˆ of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> programs and
activities and stated that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comptroller General</ENAMEX> is not
evaluating the 'results' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>'s work; he is attempting to
inquire into the process by which the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>'s work
were reached." In effect, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX> letter suggests that section
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">717</ENAMEX> does not provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> with authority to review the processes an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> follows in establishing or implementing a program or
activity. We strongly disagree with this view.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidential Memorandum</ENAMEX> establishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> provided that
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the results of this action would be the gathering of
information relevant to a national energy policy. Thus, the
meetings that are the focus of our review were the result of a
governmental activityâˆ’the establishment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>. The NEPDG
carried out many activities, the results of which are subject to
evaluation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> under the plain meaning of the statute. However,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX> letter in effect interprets Æ’resultsâ‰ˆ
as being restricted to Æ’end resultsâ‰ˆ or Æ’ultimate results.â‰ˆ Under
this narrow construction of the statute, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> would be
prohibited

deficiencies in a land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> plan, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> would be
prohibited from examining the process used to develop the plan in
order to suggest improvements. This would clearly be contrary to
the role that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has established for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>.
There is no indication in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 717</ENAMEX> or its legislative history
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to take such a narrow view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has long interpreted its audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encompassing</ENAMEX> reviews of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> processes. This position, which has
not been challenged by any prior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, is reflected in
the many congressional requests we receive to review agency
processes for a broad variety of activities. Several recent
examples include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s review of the process the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest Service</ENAMEX>
used to modify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tongass National Forest</ENAMEX> plan<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,9</NUMEX> the process used
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> to contract for the design and delivery of the

used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Corps of Engineers</ENAMEX> in preparing an environmental
impact statement for actions related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Snake River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX>.11
The legislative history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Legislative Reorganization Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, which enacted the authority now contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 717</ENAMEX>(b),
supports a broad interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>. The objective
was to enhance GAOÂ«s role of review and analysis, as part of a
larger effort to fortify congressional oversight by Æ’Âºmak[ing] more
information available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Committees</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">andÂºprovid</ENAMEX>[ing] them a means of interpreting the information they

There is no question that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has expansive oversight
powers with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> processes and activities. Numerous
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> precedents recognize a broad and encompassing power
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to engage in oversight and investigation. Thus, in
Eastland
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">v. United States Servicemen's Fund</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">421 U.S. 491, 504 n. 15</ENAMEX>
(<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> stated that the scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CongressÂ</ENAMEX>« power of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inquiry Æ’is</ENAMEX> as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power
to enact and appropriate under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Constitution</ENAMEX>.â‰ˆ
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section 712</ENAMEX> grants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> broad authority to investigate all
matters related to the use of public money and necessarily includes
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> processes in implementing programs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.14</NUMEX>
While generally asserting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> lacks authority to do this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> has acknowledged GAOÂ«s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> in one
area, agreeing that we can look into the direct and indirect
expenses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 712</ENAMEX>. To this end, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 21</TIMEX>,
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> provided us with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> pages of miscellaneous
documents purporting to relate to direct and indirect costs
incurred in the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Energy Policy</ENAMEX>. As we
have advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice PresidentÂ</ENAMEX>«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, the submission
is incomplete and is not fully responsive. Moreover, it is
virtually impossible to analyze the documentation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> We cannot do a
meaningful review without an explanation of the nature and purposes
of these costs and the appropriation that was charged. Thus far, we
have sought to obtain adequate, relevant records and explanations
without success.


<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GAOÂ«s Statutory Right of Access</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2</TIMEX> letter also asserts that the
term Æ’agencyâ‰ˆ in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">716</ENAMEX> does not include the Vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> because he is a constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
However, as noted above, we are requesting records from the Vice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> in his capacity as Chair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>
provides no support for interpreting the term Æ’agencyâ‰ˆ in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 31</ENAMEX>
as excluding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 31</ENAMEX> defines an Æ’agencyâ‰ˆ subject to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s authority very expansively, to mean a Æ’department, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, or
instrumentalityâ‰ˆ of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, but not the
legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. As broadly as the term
Æ’agencyâ‰ˆ is now defined, the statutory language before the
codification of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 31</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> emphasizes its expansiveness.
Before the codification, the relevant term was Æ’department or
establishment,â‰ˆ defined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 2</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>) to include Æ’any
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX>.â‰ˆ Given
the breadth of the statutory language, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEPDG</ENAMEX> as chaired by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> is clearly an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 31 of the United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">States Code</ENAMEX>.
The legislative history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> Act of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, which amended GAOÂ«s access statute (now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 716</NUMEX>) to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authorize GAO</ENAMEX> to enforce its right of access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> records,
made it abundantly clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> viewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and
his

For example, some pages provided are simply numbers or dollar

closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> as being within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s access authority and
subject to access enforcement actions. A key purpose of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>
Act was to strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s ability to obtain access to records in
the face of opposition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. The
principal legislative history accompanying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Act16</TIMEX> chronicled the
different access problems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> had encountered in obtaining records
to which it was legally entitled, including Æ’serious access to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> difficulties at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.â‰ˆ These included an audit
that required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> to obtain unemployment estimates from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Advisers</ENAMEX>.17
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> report accompanying the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1980 Act</ENAMEX> explicitly
recognized that Æ’the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and his principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> and
assistantsâ‰ˆ are within the scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAOÂ</ENAMEX>«s access rights and
enforcement authority<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> In order to accommodate executive branch
concerns about the extent to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> could judicially compel
disclosure of highly sensitive information, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> added the
Æ’certificationâ‰ˆ mechanism. This enables the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) to preclude
