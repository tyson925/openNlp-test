Preface
Information technology (IT) has become integral to providing
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of information in the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has moved out of the back office and off the
mainframe into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and onto the Internet. As the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> fully embraces e-commerce and other leading-edge
implementations of IT that benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in managing
the governmentÂ«s information resources becomes of paramount
importance. The development of new service approaches and the
enhancement of old ones in this new information era require the
active participation of information management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> from
the beginning.
The efficient, effective, and innovative use of information
technology requires a level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and focus that goes
beyond what would be provided in a technical support function.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recognized the need for greater <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in information
management and technology in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996</ENAMEX>, which
mandated the position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief information officer</ENAMEX> (CIO) for
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. This act and other laws define
the general responsibilities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and many of the processes
required to manage information in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
Virtually all of the major executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have appointed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>, and many have taken positive steps toward the implementation
of important information management processes specified by law. To
reap the full benefits of information management reform, federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> must utilize the full potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> as information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management leaders</ENAMEX> and active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the development of
agency strategic plans and policies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> themselves must meet
the challenges of building credible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and developing
and organizing information management capabilities to meet agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> needs.
This guide is intended to assist federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in maximizing
the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>. Principles and practices gleaned from the case
studies presented in our guide offer concrete suggestions on what
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> can do to ensure the effectiveness of their CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> does not address all of the
responsibilities which fall to federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> CIOs - only those
which have parallels in the private sector. Moreover, we find that
practices used by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> tend to differ from those
used by leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. We did not study the reasons for
these deviations specifically, but they likely result from the
context in which federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> operate. Both operational and
structural aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s environment can vary significantly
in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> versus the private sector. Rather than dwell
on differences, our study shows that there is much common ground
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> on which to build
efforts for improvement. The specific key conditions and strategies
described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> can be used as suggestions for federal CIOs
to apply or adapt to their environments, where appropriate.
We would like to thank the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Private Sector Council</ENAMEX> and the
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice organizations</ENAMEX> we selected for our study, which are
listed on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>, for providing us with the information about
their practices and assisting us in producing this executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Information Management Reform</ENAMEX>
The rapid pace of technological change and innovation in the
current information age poses wide-ranging opportunities for
improved information <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">management2</TIMEX> and enhanced performance in
achieving agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> and goals. At the same time, however, the
proliferation of technology has brought with it a range of thorny
issues surrounding managing and integrating complex processes,
computer equipment, and telecommunications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. In its
oversight role, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has established a series of laws to define
the role of information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in government and to mandate
basic processes to manage the government information technology
(IT) investment. This section provides a brief overview of that
legislative history.
The federal governmentÂ«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of its information resources
to date has produced mixed results. Consistent with reform
legislation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have taken constructive steps to implement
modern IT strategies, systems, and management practices and
policies directed toward achieving cost savings, increasing
productivity, and improving the timeliness and quality of federal
service delivery. To the extent that the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $27 billion</NUMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> planned obligations for information technology can be
invested and managed more wisely, federal programs will operate
more effectively and at less cost.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has been working to increase the
effectiveness of information and technology management in the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. An early effort was the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brooks Act</ENAMEX>, enacted in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, which called for centralized oversight of federal information
technology acquisitions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSA</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ENAMEX> (PRA) applied life cycle
management principles to information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and focused on
reducing the governmentÂ«s information-collection burden. To help
accomplish this, PRA designated senior information resources
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager positions</ENAMEX> in the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with
responsibility for a wide range of functions including information
resource planning, budgeting, organizing, controlling, training,
and ensuring the absence of duplication in information systems. PRA
also created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</ENAMEX>
within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) to provide central
oversight of information management activities across the federal
government.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> enacted additional laws holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
accountable for effective management of public information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. In particular, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Financial Officers</ENAMEX> (CFO) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Government Management Reform Act of 1994</ENAMEX> spelled out
an ambitious agenda to remedy the governmentÂ«s lack of useful,
relevant, timely, and reliable financial information. For the
governmentÂ«s major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, these laws
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) established senior-level CFO positions, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) required annual
financial statement audits, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) set expectations for more
modern systems to support integrated management of budget,
accounting, and program information. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Performance</ENAMEX> and
Results <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1993âˆš</ENAMEX> commonly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPRA</ENAMEX> or the Results Act
âˆšrequired that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> set strategic goals, measure performance
toward those goals, and report on their progress. Effective
implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Results Act</ENAMEX> hinges on agenciesÂ« ability to
produce meaningfully integrated information to manage performance
and measure results.
In this guide, information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> refers to all aspects of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of all information resources, including technology,
funds, human capital, and management processes, as well as the
underlying information. IT refers to technology used to support the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of information.
Further, amendments to the PRA in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> required that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
indicate in strategic information resources management plans how
they are applying information resources to improve the
productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of government programs,
including improvements in the delivery of services to the
public.
With this increased focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> accountability also came
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of the need to elevate the agenciesÂ« information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management positions</ENAMEX> to more strategic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>, levels,
comparable to the CFO positions created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinger-Cohen</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1996</ENAMEX> amended the PRA, renaming and elevating former
information resources <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> positions to executive-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CIOs</ENAMEX> who
report directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> head and have information management
as a primary responsibility. The new information management leaders
are accountable for not only the range of information management
activities outlined in the PRA, but also for more strategic IT
functions such as developing architectures, managing portfolios,
and measuring the performance of information technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">investments</ENAMEX>. Among other things, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clinger-Cohen Act</ENAMEX> also (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
required senior executive involvement in IT decision-making, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
imposed much-needed discipline in acquiring and managing technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) called for the redesign of inefficient work
processes before investing in technology, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) repealed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks</ENAMEX> Act, eliminating GSAÂ«s central acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>.
Primary procurement responsibility now rests directly with federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
Together with a number of other laws enacted over the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> to foster improvements in such areas as financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, acquisition, and computer security, this legislation
discussed above composes a statutory framework for achieving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">performance-based</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and accountability in not just
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, but overall federal management<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.3</NUMEX> (Appendix
I provides a list of these key federal laws affecting information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>.) As the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> for information and
technology management, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> have a key role in helping
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> fulfill many of the provisions embodied in this
management reform framework.
Even with the guidance provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> for establishing the new
information technology management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> positions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
face distinct challenges in effectively positioning federal CIOs
and supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to ensure that information management
adds value in their business/mission performance <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> face structural and cultural hurdles generally not
found elsewhere. Some of these additional challenges are described
in the final section of this guide.

Overview of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fundamental Principles</ENAMEX>
The basis for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is the belief that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
could benefit from examples set by a few leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have gained a reputation for outstanding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX>. This work is intended
to provide pragmatic guidance that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can consider in
determining how best to integrate CIO functions into their
respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target audience</ENAMEX> includes senior
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, although our observations can also
provide insights for senior information management officials
throughout the public and private sectors. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix II</ENAMEX> provides
more details on the objectives, scope, and methodology of our
work.) Based on interviews with private-sector and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> and
other research, we have developed a framework of critical success
factors and leading principles. The balance of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> describes
this framework and its application to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in the federal
government.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we interviewed described a
consistent set of key principles of information management that
they believed contributed to the successful execution of their
responsibilities. These principles touch on specific aspects of
their organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> such as formal and informal
relationships among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and others, business practices and
processes, and critical CIO functions and leadership activities.
The specific nature of these principles varied depending on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizationÂ«s</ENAMEX> mission, size, culture, and other factors, but each
underlying key principle was consistently observed.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> interviewed considered these principles instrumental
because they address critical organizational and operational
aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s role. Notably, the principles address senior
executivesÂ« responsibility for creating an effective management
context for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOsÂ</ENAMEX>« responsibilities for
building credibility and organizing information technology and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> needs. The practices are not new ideas
in the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, but rather are the
application of well-founded principles in the maturing area of
information technology and management.
These principles are most effective when implemented together in
a mutually reinforcing manner. As ad hoc efforts, each individual
principle addresses a single aspect that is necessary, but is not
sufficient for success by itself. The failure to execute a single
principle may render the others less effective. Further, although
there is no precedence among the principles, organizational
conditions may make it more feasible to address one principle
before another. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>) may
Æ’position the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> for successâ‰ˆ in advance of hiring a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> while
the other principles await the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s attention.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> illustrates the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> fundamental principles described by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> interviewed during the development of this guide. In
addition, for each principle, several key characteristics of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> that successfully execute these principles are
listed. These key characteristics can provide insights into what
constitutes successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leading Organizations</ENAMEX>

Evaluating the intent of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> principles, we observed that
they naturally fell into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct sets, which we refer to as
critical success factors. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> illustrates the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> principles
and their relationship with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> critical success factors and
their respective organizational foci.

Understanding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> principles in terms of critical success
factors is particularly useful because of characteristics that are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> by principles within the same success factor. Following is a
brief description of each critical success factor.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Align Information Management Leadership</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value Creation</ENAMEX>
The principles under the first critical success factor, Æ’Align
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Management Leadership</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value Creation</ENAMEX>,â‰ˆ advocate the
need to recognize the role of information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in creating
value and positioning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> for success; both of these principles
address issues of senior executive support. Both principles require
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the enterprise embrace the critical role
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> can play in the success of the organization
and the leadership role the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> must play in order for information
technology and management to meet its potential. The first
principle addresses the acceptance of this premise by senior
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> ensures that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> has the
organizational legitimacy to execute his or her role.
Promote Organizational Credibility
While the first success factor refers to legitimacy at a
strategic planning level, this success factor addresses a more
operational level. The principle that addresses the need to ensure
the credibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and the principle that
encourages measuring success and demonstrating results, if executed
successfully, will lead to the confidence of those with operational
responsibility in the enterprise. Without credibility, the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> will struggle to be accepted as a full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in
the development of new organizational systems and processes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Execute CIO Responsibilities</ENAMEX>
The last critical success factor, Æ’Execute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Responsibilitiesâ</ENAMEX>‰ˆ
addresses the need to organize information resources to meet
business needs and to develop the associated human capital. These
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> principles provide the foundation for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s effectiveness
in carrying out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> organizationÂ«s specific responsibilities.
Once executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> endorses the centrality of the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> and becomes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in the development of new
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> must execute its responsibilities
successfully.
The last section in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, Æ’Organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foci</ENAMEX>,â‰ˆ illustrates
how both principles within a single critical success factor require
the same organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to collaborate in their execution.
Both principles within a critical success factor also focus on the
same organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of their implementation. For
example, in the case of<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">, Æ’Promote Organizational Credibility</ENAMEX>,â‰ˆ both
principles rely on the collaboration of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> heads for success and have as their target the senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the enterprise.
The common features within a critical success factor can become
especially significant as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>, plan the
execution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> principles described in this guide. As this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> plans its strategy, it can utilize the commonality among
principles to link initiatives and utilize the synergy between
related efforts. For example, while organizing information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to meet enterprise needs and developing human capital are
distinct initiatives, they share extensive areas of commonality.
Executing both principles in
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-376G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Executive Guide</ENAMEX>
conjunction with each other can create opportunities for
efficiency and effectiveness not otherwise available.
Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of principles into critical success
factors illustrates the extent to which the work of a successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> must extend throughout the enterprise. In particular, the role
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> and other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> play in ensuring the success
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> should be noted. While it is the responsibility of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> to execute the specific responsibilities of his or her
position, it became clear to us during our case studies that the
successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> relies extensively on both vertical and horizontal
relationships within the enterprise in order to carry out these
responsibilities.
This executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> includes examples from our case study
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> as well as information from selected federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, which helped us confirm the applicability of our
findings to federal government experience. At the conclusion of
each principle, we provide a case study to describe the principle
in practice at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we visited, as well as
strategies to consider when implementing the principle. Although
this guide focuses on fundamental practices rather than detailed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX>, the examples illustrate and complement much of the
specific guidance contained in similar and related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> documents
cited in appendix <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>.


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal CIO Environment Today</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> position in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is still evolving.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> are learning how a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> can help improve effectiveness and
efficiency and better realize the benefits of their information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Current federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> are learning how to carry out their
responsibilities in the federal environment with all of the
incumbent expectations and constraints. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> are working to meet the letter and intent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinger-Cohen</ENAMEX>
Act and associated legislation effectively. The principles offered
in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> are intended to provide insight into what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> at
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> consider critical to their success, and
provide advice to federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> management as they
work to improve the use of information technology and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> faces an environment that includes many of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> encountered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> interviewed for this guide. At the
same time, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> faces additional challenges as a result
of specific legislative responsibilities (e.g., records management
and defined contracting requirements). The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> is also
subject to a funding process that is more complex and uncertain
than in most other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. The effect of the appropriations
process and the highly distributed management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> found in
several federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> tend to move some of the control of
processes having to do with information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> away from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>. Together, these characteristics, among others, differentiate
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIO</ENAMEX> environment from other environments. These
differences, and their impact on the framework developed in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX>, will be discussed in the Æ’Using this <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Guideâ‰ˆ section</ENAMEX>. The
following discussion focuses on the common elements among the
private, state, and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX>, and the application of the
framework across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>.
In a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-on-one</NUMEX> interviews with half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Council</ENAMEX>, we found that federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> face many of the
same issues as their private-sector and state government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>. Specifically, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> must overcome the
challenges of effectively linking information technology and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX>, positioning and legitimizing
information management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, measuring performance, and
building capabilities and skills. Our meeting with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Small Agency CIO Council</ENAMEX> and a number of independent
studies provide similar conclusions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> principles that
emerged from our discussions with private-sector and state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">government CIOs</ENAMEX> also describe the general areas that federal CIOs
agreed needed to be addressed. However, the specific approaches to
executing those principles tended to differ among the various
sectors.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>.
In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the principle areas, the level to which practices of
leading private versus federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have evolved is
significantly different. For example, in principle I, while leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> generally include their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in executive business
decisionmaking, in the federal government setting information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is still often viewed as a support function rather than
a strategic activity. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also consider various
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership models</ENAMEX> and position their CIOs at a clear, executive
level, as in principle II. In contrast, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIO</ENAMEX> implementation
is in more nascent stages, lacking criteria for matching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> types
with organizational needs. Further, in principle V, while leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> are flexible in reassigning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and structuring
capabilities across business and technology lines, federal staffing
practices and organizational structures are less flexible in
nature.
Performance measurement (principle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>) and information
management human capital development (principle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>) are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas
that private, state, and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> all agreed must be addressed
in order for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and the supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to be
successful. Practices used by both the private and public sectors
in the area of performance measurement are still evolving. In both
performance measurement and human capital development, practices
used by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIOs</ENAMEX> differed from those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, though federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIOs</ENAMEX> were actively trying to address
the issues. Differences in the approaches used probably resulted
from specific constraints in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIO</ENAMEX> environment, including
a focus on nonfinancial program benefits, rather than financial
return on investments.
Credibility <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, principle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in both the public and private sector have all adopted similar
practices. The precise application of the practices depended on the
specific contexts of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, but the approaches were
consistent. It may be noted that this is one of the few principles
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> may address themselves, without regard to organizational
constraints or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> support. Of course, as stated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the
effectiveness of this principle is moderated by the extent to which
the other principles have been implemented.
The following table summarizes the practices of our sample
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> in each principle area and compares them with
practices in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIO</ENAMEX> environment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>: Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leading Practices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Practices</ENAMEX>

In terms of critical success factors, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
tend to trail the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> interviewed for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> in the Æ’Align
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Management Leadership</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value Creationâ‰ˆ</ENAMEX> and Æ’Execute
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Responsibilitiesâ</ENAMEX>‰ˆ factors. The successful execution of these
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> critical success factors depends to a great extent on officials
other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>. In the first success factor, the CIO depends to
a great extent on the other senior executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to support
the inclusion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> in critical strategic discussions. In the
other factor, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIO</ENAMEX> tends to be constrained by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organizational</ENAMEX> attributes typical of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>. These
attributes include, but are not limited to, relatively little
flexibility in financial reward systems and highly distributed
organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in a number of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
This is not to say that there are no examples of progress in the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> in either of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> success factors. The federal
response to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX> computing challenge created an
opportunity in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in responding to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> mission needs. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">partnering</ENAMEX> took place at the senior executive level and contributed
to the success of the federal Y2K effort. In addition, the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Personnel Management</ENAMEX>, and individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have been working together to develop new approaches to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compensating</ENAMEX> and retaining information technology and management
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.
It is interesting to note that the remaining critical success
factor, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Æ’Promote Organizational Credibility</ENAMEX>,â‰ˆ is executed about the
same within all sectors, since all sectors approach principle III
similarly, and no sector executes principle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> well. As noted, it
is within this critical success factor that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> is able to
operate with the greatest individual flexibility.
Table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> indicates that a gap exists between the practices of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal CIOs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Areas</ENAMEX> in which gaps
exist should be examined carefully to understand the basis for the
differences as well as opportunities for greater implementation of
the principles. It is possible that the business context for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal CIOs</ENAMEX> is sufficiently different from that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> that lessons learned may not be applicable. Some of
these differences are described in the final section of this guide.
At the same time, an understanding of the information technology
and management practices of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> could contribute
to the development of improved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> management practices in the
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>.
The following sections describe each of the general principles
and practices discovered in our work with leading CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.
Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success Factors</ENAMEX>

Principles
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organizational Foci</ENAMEX>




Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success Factor 1</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Align Information Management</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leadership</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value Creation</ENAMEX>

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> must have active support and
commitment at the very top of the enterprise or they will remain
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> and tangential to the business, despite their potential
contribution to mission accomplishment. This first critical success
factor focuses on the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterprise</ENAMEX> in developing a culture that includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">senior-level</ENAMEX> decision making and that assumes the potential of IT
in creating value for the enterprise. Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> is
essential to the successful execution of this factor.
A common theme among the CIOs we interviewed was that the
message of the importance of IT to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> must be
communicated at the highest levels. Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> must embrace
the central role of technology, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> must be a full
participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> at the table with them as business strategy is
discussed. This behavior begins with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>, who sets the example
for senior and mid-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and, through them, the rest of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. In addition, the participation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> in
long-range strategic planning is necessary to take full advantage
of the opportunities IT can provide and to ensure that the
technology infrastructure is in place as business strategies
develop.

Principle <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">I: Recognize the Role</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Management</ENAMEX> in
Creating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Æ’The CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s ability to add value is the biggest single factor in
determining whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> views IT as an asset or a
liability.â‰ˆ

Instituting an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> does not start with
selection or placement of an information technology and management
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, nor does it begin with establishing a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for
managing information resources and activities. Rather, it begins
with consideration on the part of executive-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> of the
role of IT and how vital it is to accomplishing mission objectives.
It also entails thinking about ways to incorporate the information
technology and management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in the executive-level management
structure and create an environment that facilitates
business/technology sharing and exchange of ideas. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> can set powerful examples through their own strong
relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>. Such relationships symbolize the
importance of information technology and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> within their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.

Key Characteristics
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> have primary responsibility for setting the
business context for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> and formulating strategies for
integrating information technology and management into their
business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX> of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> no longer
regard technology management as a separate support function and
instead strive to understand how investments in information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> are made and how they integrate with other investments
and the overall business vision. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> also increasingly
focus on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, operations, program and service delivery
benefits, and performance of their major strategic information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX> have a key role in setting the example for the rest
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to follow in seeking to understand information
technology and management concepts and appreciating the strategic
role that information technology and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> can play in helping
to accomplish business objectives. Viewing information and
technology not just as assets to manage, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX> assign their
information technology and management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> a prominent role in
business decision making. Recognizing the business transformation
potential of IT, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> also position their CIOs as
change <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> with responsibility for applying technology to
achieve major improvements in fundamental business processes and
operations. With <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> support, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> are in a good position to
have significant impact on not just IT, but the entire business
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterprise</ENAMEX>.
Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEOÂ</ENAMEX>«s lead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the senior executive team
learn to value the advice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> in setting business directions
and developing strategies for improving organizational capabilities
and competitiveness. They seek to embrace fundamental information
technology and management principles and work with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> to
develop a shared vision of the role of IT within the business
context. They engage in dialogue on
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-376G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Executive Guide</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> that technology can be incorporated to improve business
processes, outputs, and outcomes. They incorporate information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> as an intrinsic part of their business planning and
decision making processes, discussing the benefits and risks
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with specific strategies for improving service, reducing
cycle time, or reducing costs.
In leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> make joint decisions
on information resources, formulate business plans, and set
performance expectations. Increasingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> make IT investment
decisions based on the value of the investments to their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterprises</ENAMEX>, not just to a specific business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> or function. By
asking strategic and operational questions at the beginning of the
planning and evaluation period, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> gain a better
understanding of the potential benefits and value of IT.
Information and technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are
also adopting processes that help them quantify and align projects
with their organizationsÂ« business planning and measurement
processes. They produce plans that link to overall business plans
and assign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to act as liaisons between business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Increasingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> also focus on measuring
reliability, responsiveness, and customer satisfaction, which in
the eyes of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> are just as important as strictly
financial measures.
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> work to create environments that are
conducive to sharing ideas on how information technology can
support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and vice versa. They adopt formal mechanisms
and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that facilitate the ability of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and
information technology and management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to understand and
communicate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> anotherÂ«s issues and work together to accomplish a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> business vision. These mechanisms and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> include
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forums</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">councils</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> for discussion and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> on
business and technology issues. Such forums help promote
organizationwide perspective and facilitate the ability to achieve
consensus or stakeholder buy-in to business/technology directions.
For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has a strategic planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> that brings
together major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> statewide to identify strategic and
tactical issues, including IT issues confronting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The
state prepares a strategic planning document based on this
stakeholder input. This process has helped to integrate information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> into overall business planning by aligning IT products
and services with business functions and linking technology to the
stateÂ«s overall strategic direction.
To further support the business/technology collaboration,
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> adopt a common business language, skillfully
avoiding technical jargon and instead using language that general
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislatures</ENAMEX> can understand. They use analogies,
terminology, and processes that help fuse business and technology
interests and ideas together. Other strategies for
business/technology learning include informal activities such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">newsletters</ENAMEX>, presentations, reports, and service-level results
placed in common areas to communicate the effectiveness of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> further the two-way
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of ideas and perspectives by bringing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> from the
field to advise or educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> on recent trends and
developments in both the business and technology <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">arenas</ENAMEX>. Realizing
that attitudes, expectations, and culture seldom change quickly,
they plan for whatever time and resources are necessary to create a
common ground and organizational cohesiveness. Their efforts go a
long way in shoring up commitment from across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to
strategies for achieving common goals.
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also focus on hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who bring a
hybrid of business and technical expertise to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. One
large multinational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> uses Æ’technical facilitatorsâ‰ˆ to
support its initiatives. In the past, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had experienced
problems in sharing information resources. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> in the
different lines of business were unwilling to share information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> because each felt his or her particular line of business
was unique. Because technology was becoming critical to future
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> in this business sector, top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> were increasingly
assigned to support and manage the companyÂ«s internal information
management functions. Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> assigned had both
business and technology acumen and had the ability to raise
business issues from a technical perspective in a nonthreatening
manner. In resolving business issues, they were sometimes able to
identify more efficient technical opportunities.

Case Study: Recognizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Role of Information Management</ENAMEX> in
Creating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value</ENAMEX>
Due to changes in market conditions and requirements for
increased productivity through using common components, a large
manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> decided that it needed to make major changes
in the way it managed IT to support the business. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had
outsourced its information management function, but lacked the
infrastructure to provide strategic direction, discipline, and
overall management of information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to ensure optimal
implementation and cost. Given this situation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was
faced with a proliferation of legacy systems and inefficient
business processes built around them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> also met with
bureaucratic business resistance to change to a common information
systems environment.
By way of improvement, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> adopted a new IT
strategic direction and focus that tracked back to the companyÂ«s
business prioritiesÂ¬ Æ’common, lean and fast, global, and growth.â‰ˆ
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> then hired a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> as a change <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, reporting to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> and the companyÂ«s senior decision making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>,
and gave him responsibility for transforming the IT function,
thereby making him an enabler of the function and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">an integral part</ENAMEX>
of the business strategy.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> recruited an IT management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that understood both the
business and technical sides of the enterprise. He instituted a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, creating a leadership structure
that provided flexibility for meeting future information management
needs as well as maintaining existing IT systems. The new IT
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> became responsible for such strategic activities as
participating in the development of overall business strategies;

Strategies to Consider
Instituting information technology and management as a support
function separate from the business is an ineffective and outdated
model. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognize the role of IT in supporting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> accomplishment and seek to integrate it with business
operations. The following outlines the strategies that senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> commonly use to promote
information management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> involvement in business decision
making and maximize the benefits from their IT investments.
Focus on efforts to incorporate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> into the
overall business by


â€¢
ensuring executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and commitment for the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, both at the career and political levels;


â€¢
embracing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> as a full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> of the executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management team</ENAMEX>;


â€¢
developing structured approaches for exploring the broad
range of opportunities and strategies in information technology
available to enhance the business; and



â€¢
focusing technology initiatives on creating value and
providing the information needed by internal and external
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>.

Provide an atmosphere that supports executive understanding of
IT by


â€¢
creating and using formal and informal executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> channels to make the business case for integrating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> into organizationwide decision-making;
and


â€¢
emphasizing returns and metrics that clearly link
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> with an organizationÂ«s business
needs.





<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Principle II</ENAMEX>: Position the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Æ’There</ENAMEX> is no cookie-cutter approach, so knowing what fits in an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> is key to finding the right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> to match with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>.â‰ˆ

There is no one right way to establish a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> position.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diversities</ENAMEX> in corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, cultures, and
capabilities prohibit a prescriptive approach to information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management leadership</ENAMEX>. There are nonetheless a number of practices
and alternative strategies that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> use to help define and institute their CIO positions
to effectively meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> needs. This section examines those
practices, providing pragmatic guidance that other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
can also consider in determining how best to integrate CIO
functions into their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.

Key Characteristics
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognize that a
one-size-fits-all solution to establishing information management
leadership does not exist. Rather, they take responsibility for
ensuring that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are consistent with the business,
technical, and cultural contexts of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX>
do so by examining their internal environments and asking a series
of questions about the problems that need fixing, how information
technology and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> can help, and how a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> might best fit
within their management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to guide technology solutions.
The answers to these questions help them choose from a range of
alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CIO</ENAMEX> approaches.
Specifically, by defining mission improvement objectives, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> determine whether their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> needs a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> who is
a networking/marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>, business change <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>,
operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>, policy/oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, or any combination
thereof. Studying existing IT capabilities helps define the
structure and responsibilities of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
Considering the centralized or decentralized nature of the
enterprise helps determine the corporate CIOÂ«s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> level and
how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> shares responsibility with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>. Further, appreciating organizational culture and change
readiness helps define the pace and extent to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> can
accomplish business transformation.
Business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> keep in mind that initial CIO <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> adopted
should not be set in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>, but may have to be adjusted over time
as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> grow or mature. For example, while a company
may need a business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX> to build a new IT capability, over
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> another type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> may be better suited to sustaining
operations. This evolution in the CIO role is also reflected by the
introduction of variant leadership positions in information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> (i.e., chief knowledge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> or chief technical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>) that diffuse responsibility across several senior-level
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that we visited
has multiple product line CIOs. The most senior information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management executive</ENAMEX> positioned at a level above these CIOs asserts
that he is not the Æ’corporate CIOâ‰ˆ and does not want to be. With
the belief that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> cannot embody all the knowledge needed
to effectively direct information technology and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> uses an executive-level technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> as a forum for building consensus for IT initiatives.
In conjunction with determining their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> clearly define up front the roles, responsibilities, and
accountability of their CIOs for enterprisewide information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, better enabling their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> to operate effectively
within the parameters of their positions vis-Ã -vis those of their
senior management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COO</ENAMEX>). Typically, CIOs
serve as a bridge between top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, and end
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CIOs</ENAMEX> provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and vision, focusing senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> on highvalue information technology issues, investments,
and decisions. They may also serve as business change <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>,
challenging conventional approaches and developing new methods and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> for delivering mission benefits. The case study at the end
of this section provides an example of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> hired specifically to
help transform information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and business operations.
In this strategic capacity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> take the lead role in
integrating information and technology management and performance
across the entire information life cycle. They are responsible for
such activities as planning, setting standards and policies, and
designing and managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architectures</ENAMEX> to guide introduction of
technology products and services. While not all CIOs necessarily
have hands-on responsibility, their purview may also incorporate
any or all of the operational elements of information and
technology management, such as data processing, infrastructure
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and systems acquisition.
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> provide their CIOs with the authority they
need to effectively carry out their diverse responsibilities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executives</ENAMEX> ensure this by giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> a key role in IT
investment decision-making, providing budget control, or ensuring
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> backing for information technology and management
programs and initiatives. Formally documenting or, in the case of
public-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, legislating, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> roles and
responsibilities can help in managing performance and expectations
of both the enterprise and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>. For example, the position of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> CIO that we interviewed was based on a
specific statute establishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> level and
assigning clear-cut responsibilities for funding and overseeing IT
operations statewide.
While there is no single template for doing so, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> apply consistent criteria in
selecting their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>. The most obvious criterion is relevant IT
expertise. Rather than being technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> specifically, their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> intuitively understand IT principles and trends and act as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX>, applying technology and approaches skillfully to help
resolve or overcome daunting business challenges. But even while IT
expertise is important, their CIOs are business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> as well,
with experience in administrative, financial, and corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Such experience better enables the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> to work with
business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to build a shared vision for meeting mission
needs. For instance, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> state government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> attributed his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> to his breadth of experience across a variety of financial,
retail, and IT <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, which facilitates his ability to
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-376G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Executive Guide</ENAMEX>
get buy-in from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Additional
proficiencies critical to CIO success include leadership ability,
innovation and flexibility, effective communications skills,
interpersonal skills, and political astuteness. The weight that
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> assign to each of these criteria in selecting a
CIO depends on the information management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> model and the
needs of the enterprise.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> are no longer tied to a single functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unitâˆši</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">e.</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Æ’IT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â‰ˆ Instead</ENAMEX>, they are positioned as senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> with
the ability to strategically view and apply IT to the best
advantage of the enterprise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> generally report to and partner
with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> heads, forging relationships that ensure high
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visibility</ENAMEX> and support for far-reaching information management
initiatives. As active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEOsÂ</ENAMEX>« executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> are well situated to provide advice and direction, integrate
IT with the business vision, and take part in high-level
decision-making. Active participation in executive processes and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> facilitates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOsÂ</ENAMEX>« ability to build effective
executive-level working relationships.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case Study: Positioning the CIO</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, this manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> instituted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> position to
help build its information management capability after deciding to
split its former internal IT service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> off as an independent
business. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, the manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had relied on a
wholly owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subsidiary</ENAMEX> to provide IT products and services. With
minimal IT talent left in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> following the split-off, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> had to create a new IT leadership <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> used a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to search for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> to build the
in-house information management capability. Essentially, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> wanted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> with IT expertise, strong management skills,
and background experience in managing large, centralized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
The current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> exceeded their requirements. He came highly
recommended due to his prior success in transforming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and his skill in outsourcing, which would be needed to
manage the manufacturerÂ«s continued reliance on information
technology contract services. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> accepted the position only
after obtaining senior executivesÂ« commitment to his vision for
transforming not just information technology and management, but
processes in the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> set the CIO up to succeed. They positioned him
as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the senior decision-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, reporting to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice-Chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. They gave him the flexibility to
bring in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> from the outside and set up a matrix management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> consisting of multiple business sector CIOs aligned
with functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, all reporting to the
corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>. They required that any IT initiative include
collaboration between a sector <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and a process-responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>,
as illustrated in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> also made the CIO the
final authority on all IT budget, operations, and process
management issues. During the period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 through 1999</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> has been effective in lowering projected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> IT costs, for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> the total reduction was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $450 million</NUMEX>, when taking into
account both cost avoidance and cost reduction, while enhancing the
provision of IT services to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.

Strategies to Consider
In the absence of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> for instituting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> take precautions to ensure that their information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management leadership positions</ENAMEX> are appropriately defined and
implemented to meet their unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> needs. The following is
an outline of the strategies that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> in these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> use to determine the types of CIOs they need, select
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to carry out these roles, and position them as
effective and influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the senior executive
decision-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>.
Determine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> by


â€¢
examining the current environment and identifying what
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> expects to accomplish through information management
before establishing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> position to lead improvements;
and



â€¢
making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> type (i.e., business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategist</ENAMEX>, marketing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>, policy and oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>) consistent with the enterpriseÂ«s mission, history, current
environment, culture, and change readiness.

Define clear roles and accountability for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> by


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">delineating</ENAMEX> CIO roles and responsibilities vis-Ã -vis
those of other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>;


â€¢
ensuring that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> has the authority needed to be
effective; and



â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">documenting CIO</ENAMEX> roles, responsibilities, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accountabilities</ENAMEX> to help manage expectations and
performance.

Select a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> with the right skills set by


â€¢
choosing someone with information technology and
management expertise and the potential to help in business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX>, consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> model selected;
and



â€¢
ensuring that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> also has the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and
communications skills and other proficiencies needed to effectively
carry out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> position.

Make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> a business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> by


â€¢
having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with other senior executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>,


â€¢
empowering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> to work with other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>
to discuss and decide among alternative IT products and strategies
for meeting business needs, and


â€¢
ensuring that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> is involved in strategy discussions
at the highest levels so that he or she can lead the enterprise in
using information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> to corporate advantage rather than
merely responding to client requests.


Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success Factors</ENAMEX>
Principles

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organizational Foci</ENAMEX>






Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Success Factor 2: Promote Organizational</ENAMEX>
Credibility
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> critical success factor focuses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s ability
to establish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> as a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterprise</ENAMEX>. The legitimacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> must
be developed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEOÂ</ENAMEX>«s message of information technology and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">managementÂ«s</ENAMEX> central role to be accepted and for the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> to become a full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in formulating corporate
strategy.
Both principles in this critical success factor pertain to the
demonstration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that can
complete critical projects successfully and contribute to the well
being of the enterprise. This effort is largely the responsibility
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>, and the focus is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> and downward. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> must
create an environment in which the ability of the CIO organization
to contribute to the success of the enterprise is recognized.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX>, to be appreciated, has to be demonstrable and measurable.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> is not able to demonstrate that he or she deserves the
support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> and makes a valuable contribution to the
corporate mission, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> will not be effective as a full
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in the corporate decision-making process.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Principle III</ENAMEX>: Ensure the Credibility of the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX>
Æ’While placement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> position at a high level within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> may carry some weight, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> generally must earn
credibility by making things happen.â‰ˆ

Instituting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> position consistent with organizational needs
and finding a capable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> to fill the job are no guarantee of
CIO success. Rather, the burden of ensuring information technology
and management effectiveness shifts from senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and his or her supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. Given the relative
newness of the position vis-a-vis the rest of the business, the CIO
is faced with having to gain the attention and respect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>
at all levels across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and build the support and
cooperation needed to effectively execute the information
management leadership role. The following is a discussion of the
strategies that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> use to legitimize
their roles and successfully collaborate with their business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> to guide IT solutions to meet mission needs.

Key Characteristics
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognize that providing effective
information management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and vision is a principal means
of building credibility for their CIO positions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> do this in a
number of ways. Foremost, they do not manage IT in a vacuum, but
rather make sure that the information management program is well
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> with what senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> want to accomplish. CIOs
work with their executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> to jointly produce a vision
educating senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> on the strategic value of IT, providing
advice and direction, and setting expectations of what can be
achieved. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> express this vision in business rather than
technical terms, and in such a manner as to generate enthusiasm,
buy-in, and motivation for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to strive together toward the
achievement of common goals. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> participate on executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> that provide forums for promoting and
building consensus for IT strategies and solutions. We found this
to be true for each of the case study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that we
visited. Having achieved senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> interest and backing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> can leverage this support as needed to help ensure cooperation
for carrying out information technology and management and business
change initiatives across the enterprise.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Effective CIOs</ENAMEX>, and their supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, do not set
out to force their ideas and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> on their business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>. Instead, they seek to bridge the gap between
technology and the business by networking informally, forming
alliances, and building friendships that help ensure support for
information technology and management. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> then work
with rather than for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, getting them involved in
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> and driving ownership and accountability to line
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, rather than to the IT <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. For example, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case
study, the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> placed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in charge
of managing the planning, funding, and implementation of a project
to develop a single telecommunications network to serve the stateÂ«s
entire education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Rather than a technical challenge, the
project has been a huge coordination effort, requiring that the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> overcome rivalries and achieve the commitment and
cooperation of traditionally autonomous education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> retain the support of their business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> by
following through on commitments to effectively lead business
transformation projects, provide needed IT products and services,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> and educate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user community</ENAMEX>. Through it all, CIOs
strive to maintain open communications and build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX>. They do so
by being accessible to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> feedback,
and focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> needs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> recognize that balancing short-term successes with
longer-term business change initiatives is key to keeping their
business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> satisfied. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the initial months</TIMEX> of tenure, CIOs
set out to understand their enterprisesÂ« needs and tackle tough
issues (i.e., runaway projects and crisis situations such as year
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> management) that demand immediate attention or could pose
immediate obstacles to success. In the short term, they also focus
on building relationships, addressing business imperatives (i.e.,
process streamlining and consolidation), and demonstrating success
by promptly providing highimpact products and services (i.e.,
commercial off-the-shelf software and desktop equipment) that allow
them to achieve positive and visible accomplishments fairly
quickly. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> recognize that showing interim results concurrent
with more protracted efforts such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multiyear</TIMEX> systems
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">developments</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Æ’big-ticketâ</NUMEX>‰ˆ infrastructure projects, or business
process reengineering can have significant positive impact on CIO
credibility.
Often, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> outline plans of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attack</ENAMEX> or roadmaps to help guide
them in effectively implementing their short- and long-term
strategies. Documenting their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> of action helps them manage
schedules and expectations and provides baselines against which to
assess progress and performance. These CIOs are careful not to get
caught in the cycle of continual planning, but take steps to ensure
effective progression from planning to implementation. They return
to their plans iteratively, updating them as progress is made and
business needs evolve.
Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognize that there is
too much going on in the area of information technology and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> for them to absorb all of the issues alone. Rather than
allowing their technology ideas and programs to stagnate, they keep
abreast of changes in the fast-paced environment that might be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to enhance capability and improve mission performance in
their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. They do so through avid reading, working
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, and following market directions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> also benchmark,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with, or seek advice from successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> and competitors
on initiatives that provide opportunities for exchanging ideas,
sharing capability and expertise, and achieving mutual benefits in
the larger information technology and management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. For
example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> with whom we met said that he values the

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-376G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Executive Guide</ENAMEX> Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX> received from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of private industry
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, convened by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> to facilitate learning
from business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> with a major IT
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corporation</ENAMEX> on a project to acquire standard desktop equipment for
all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> under the governorÂ«s purview. Participation in key
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">councils</ENAMEX>, advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, trade, and professional
associations such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industry Advisory Council</ENAMEX> and the National
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of State Information Resource Executives</ENAMEX> is also useful
for exchanging ideas, sharing information, and identifying new ways
to meet common challenges.


<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case Study: Ensuring the Credibility</ENAMEX> of the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX>
This stateÂ«s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Network</ENAMEX> (JNET) illustrates how
implementation of many of the practices discussed in this section
has enhanced the credibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and his supporting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> is a highly successful project started by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> enabling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to jointly develop a single,
secure, web-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> to support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of criminal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The project responds to the governorÂ«s
priority for consolidated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> projects, thereby ensuring
high-level support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> efforts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> conceived
the idea for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> after receiving multiple requests from criminal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice agencies</ENAMEX> for funding to develop redundant systems. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> identified the joint project as a good opportunity to
save on costs, share information, and reduce redundancy and errors
by making it possible to enter new offender information only once
as subjects proceed through the criminal justice process.
Historically, the stateÂ«s justice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have been highly
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">autonomous</ENAMEX> and distrustful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX>. Prior attempts to get the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to work together failed. IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> recognize that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> with the current initiative goes a long way in increasing
CIO credibility with the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> launched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> by bringing together
stakeholders from across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in a series of meetings over the
course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX> to establish a vision for a shared system that
would also meet individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> agency information needs. Under
executive order, a senior-level leadership <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, including the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>, is responsible for establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> policy, direction, and
standards and for authorizing the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> funds. A steering
committee consisting of justice agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> works with
information management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> to refine
project details. Its biweekly meetings provide a good opportunity
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to build relationships with the state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> and for agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to get acquainted and learn
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> anotherÂ«s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and data resources. With central
responsibility for controlling contracts and funding drawn from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agenciesÂ«</ENAMEX> budgets, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is credited with being the
Æ’glueâ‰ˆ that holds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> together. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, established to
administer the project on a day-to-day basis, also reports directly
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>.
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIO</ENAMEX> guidance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> has been planned as a multiphase,
multiyear development effort with interim products and results. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> successfully complete a pilot
phase to prototype initial JNET content and applications, also
demonstrating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> organizationÂ«s ability to help deliver on
commitments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> additional phases involve testing the systemÂ«s
basic data-sharing function and adding new capabilities such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> importing, on-line processing, and document management.
Initially, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice agencies</ENAMEX> thought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> was a bad idea; agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> were pessimistic and merely went through the
motions of working together. They posed such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> that at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenant governor</ENAMEX> make a surprise visit to
a steering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> meeting to oversee project progress,
demonstrate senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> support, and ensure agency
cooperation toward meeting common objectives. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> saw
the operational prototype and the projectÂ«s potential, they
realized that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> sacrifices had paid off.
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> continues to grow in scope and popularity. Along
with it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> credibility has increased. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is
currently working with several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> to help link them with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX>. Next steps include instituting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNET</ENAMEX> at the local level and
ultimately partnering with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to construct a nationwide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNETÂ</ENAMEX>«s success has served to legitimize and
increase the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> function to its business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>. Now, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health and Public Welfare</ENAMEX>, also want to work with the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> on similar cross-functional information management
initiatives.



Strategies to Consider
While senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are responsible for creating the
environments and positions likely to ensure CIO success, it is the
responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> themselves to make that success a
reality. Regardless of all the promising skills, strategies, and
technologies they may bring to bear, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CIO</ENAMEX> can be effective
without first building credibility with business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, IT
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user communities</ENAMEX> alike to ensure commitment and
support for their information management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and
initiatives. The following practices, commonly used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to build credibility, can also be considered
and applied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to better
legitimize their positions and help ensure success in their
individual business/cultural environments.
Provide information management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and vision by


â€¢
ensuring that the vision encompasses senior management
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">priorities,</ENAMEX>


â€¢
educating top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> on the value of information
technology and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in helping to accomplish mission
objectives,


â€¢
articulating the vision in business terms to facilitate
line management understanding and achievement of buy-in,
and



â€¢
using senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> discussion and decision-making
forums as opportunities to build consensus for IT programs and
initiatives.

Establish effective working relationships by


â€¢
networking informally and forming alliances with other
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> to help defuse potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> and build
commitment to new technology directions;


â€¢
getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> from the business side of the enterprise
involved and accountable for information management
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>;


â€¢
fulfilling commitments to provide effective IT goods and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>; and



â€¢
establishing open communications and feedback mechanisms,
such as surveys and questionnaires, as a way to build
trust.

Balance quick successes with long term impact by


â€¢
setting priorities and distinguishing between short term,
high-impact initiatives and longer term objectives that require
more vested interest; and


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€¢</ENAMEX> outlining a plan or strategy for accomplishing these
priorities in an efficient and effective manner.
Leverage external information technology and management
expertise by


â€¢
keeping abreast of technological change and incorporating
new products and strategies in the enterpriseÂ«s IT program as
appropriate,


â€¢
forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> and building off of the success and
expertise of external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, and


â€¢
networking and participating in forums in the larger
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> to debate and identify ways to address common information
technology and management issues and concerns.





<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Principle IV</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Measure Success and Demonstrate Results</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Æ’Measurement</ENAMEX> determines what one pays attention to. The things
that are measured become relevant; the things that are omitted are
out of sight and mind.â‰ˆ

In many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> the value of information technology and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> is considered intangibleÂ¬difficult to measure and mired
in terms of Æ’soft dollarsâ‰ˆ or Æ’strategic assets.â‰ˆ For this reason,
in the past, few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> embarked on programs to measure the
effectiveness of IT systems. However, it has become increasingly
evident that without a measurement process where results can be
demonstrated, not only is information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> at a disadvantage
when competing for scarce resources, but also when making its case
in support of efficiency and effectiveness initiatives. For the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> to be viewed as part of the business, a structured
process needs to be in place to measure success and demonstrate
results to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. This section discusses the approaches
that leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> use to measure performance and
results.

Key Characteristics
While there is no standardized approach to performance
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> strive to understand and measure
what drives and affects their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and how to best evaluate
results. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have generally struggled with
identifying and adopting measures to assess the value of IT, but
have been able to put some measures in place to help demonstrate
performance. They use measures for a variety of purposes. The
measures are a vehicle for communicating with senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in the areas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> deems important.
Measures also serve as vital management and decision-making tools,
providing information that can be used to make improvements in
business outcomes and service delivery.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> told us that the measures that capture the most
attention from senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> are simple onesÂ¬or at least simple
in terms of how they are expressed. In a number of instances, the
organizations we visited used uncomplicated terms to communicate
measures, but the underlying concepts were quite involved and
required a good understanding of IT and business fundamentals.
These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> collapsed a lot of information into a form that
effectively communicated the success or failure of information
technology and management activities and, in the case of the
latter, expanded on the issues and supplied additional information.
For example, one international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, involved in several
product lines, measures its performance in line with the following
organizational business priorities:


â€¢
Maximize performance (i.e., improve service and reduce IT
and management costs)


â€¢
Improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> processes (i.e., IT projects and
E-commerce)


â€¢
Increase team contributions


â€¢
Create a leading-edge electronic communications
process


Even though these measures seem simple, a considerable amount of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, effort, and data are involved in amassing and assessing the
results tied to these business priorities.
To establish joint ownership for performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> strive to construct measures jointly with their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. They work
together to achieve a common understanding of goals, metrics, and
anticipated outcomes that are easy to understand but are aimed at
adding value. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> told us that performance measurement systems
work best when combined with established measures that reflect
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>/stakeholder needs and the activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> that are
directly involved in information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> organizationÂ«s
responsibility does not end with the establishment of measures, nor
does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> have sole responsibility for
technological success. As a practical matter, those responsible for
judging the success of programs and their supporting functions
should agree on the measures used and become involved in monitoring
the outcomes.
Although approaches vary, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> develop measures
with a focus toward improving not only internal IT performance but
also external relationships with technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and the overall
business. Organizations balance various technical measures to
ensure that IT products and services are deployed in the most
effective and efficient ways and lead to desired business results.
They focus on monitoring short- and long-term IT measures that
directly affect business activities and produce real business
value. This means that IT activities must be directly related to
company relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, and
also affect business results, such as direct costs or market
share.
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> use performance measures that focus on
business outcomes such as customer satisfaction levels, service
levels, and in some instances total requests satisfied. For
example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> requires that his
departments develop tactical plans for all areas, not just IT. All
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> participate in the planning process. The performance
measures are broken down to meaningful levels as a way of holding
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Æ’IT shopâ‰ˆ</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> accountable for the services
they provide. IT goals and objectives are incorporated into the
plans and IT performance outcomes are provided to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX>
and his executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> basis. This exercise has
served to build credibility and help demonstrate the value that IT
adds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The existence of performance measures has
also made a difference in how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> behave because the
documentation they provide serves to make them accountable.
To properly collect and analyze information, leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> develop measurement systems that provide insight into
their IT service delivery and business processes. The establishment
of an information feedback system allows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to link
activities and functions to business initiatives and management
goals. This feedback, in turn, leads to increased IT productivity
and organizational effectiveness. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> state we visited established
an information services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> to develop statewide policy standards
and to monitor projects as part of its portfolio management
process. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, however, has
Page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>-376G <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Executive Guide</ENAMEX>
increasingly become more involved in monitoring and making
recommendations on troubled IT projects. Some of the lessons
learned from the boardÂ«s project reviews are that:


â€¢
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> needs to get involved early in monitoring and
overseeing projects before considerable funds are spent on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>;


â€¢
long-term, high-cost projects are no longer sustainable
because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> tend to be unable to sustain long-term
support;


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> are best managed in a limited-commitment, phased
approach; and


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> should quickly demonstrate results.


Once planning and decision-making structures are in place and
performance results can be used as part of the decision-making
process, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are in a better position to ensure that
goals and objectives clearly link and align with IT performance
measures. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also assess the readiness of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> to use IT measures and their receptiveness to data
collection, measurement, and analysis. Further, they nurture a
philosophy that is positive toward performance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, and they view measures as a way to focus on business
value and customer satisfaction.
In summary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> we studied cautioned
that IT performance measurement is in its infancy and measurement
techniques are still evolving, partly due to changes in technology.
Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are continually looking for ways to
improve their IT measurement systems as a means of supporting
achievement of organizational goals.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case Study: Measuring Success and Demonstrating Results</ENAMEX>
To measure its information technology (IT) and management
initiatives, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> state instituted a performance measurement process
(illustrated in figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) that is driven by an IT strategic plan.
The plan sets forth the goals and strategies needed to support the
stateÂ«s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> in developing IT plans, in using information
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, and in defining IT performance measures. The IT
strategic plan also aligns very closely with the stateÂ«s strategic
plan, that sets forth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> broad goals for the use of IT within the
state: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) improve service delivery; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) make information more
accessible; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) use IT to improve productivity; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) invest in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, tools, and methods. The IT strategic plan also incorporates
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">stakeholder</ENAMEX> involvement by including perspectives by state agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> on the
use of the stateÂ«s IT resources. Also included in the plan is
information from the stateÂ«s biennial IT performance report. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">report</ENAMEX> evaluates the stateÂ«s progress toward meeting the last
bienniumÂ«s IT Strategic Plan goals and includes a summary of
strategic and operational performance measures. These measures, in
part, are the result of the stateÂ«s previous IT strategic plan and

Strategies to Consider
Performance measurement is a critical step in ensuring results
and success from any project, but especially from information
technology and management initiatives whose value is often
difficult to capture. While performance measurement is still
evolving in principle and in practice, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have
pinpointed a number of strategies that have proven useful in
gauging the impact and benefits of their IT investments. These
strategies are discussed below.
Engage internal and external stakeholders in defining and
managing IT performance by


â€¢
ensuring that mission delivery and IT performance
measures are integral to strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and decision-making
processes; and



â€¢
establishing internal and external customer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to
periodically review, validate, and accept IT performance
measures.

Ensure that processes are in place to balance business and
technical measures by


â€¢
developing specific technical performance measures for IT
products and services and balancing them with business-driven
measures, and



â€¢
demonstrating that the performance measurement data
generated are reliable and useful.

Establish an effective data collection and performance feedback
process by


â€¢
developing well-designed performance data collection
methods;


â€¢
establishing a limited set of outcome-based performance
measures that link to mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">outputs</ENAMEX> and outcomes; and


â€¢
utilizing concise, understandable performance reporting
tools and techniques and conducting performance measurement
reviews, as needed.


Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success Factors</ENAMEX>

Principles
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Organizational Foci</ENAMEX>






Critical <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Success Factor 3: Execute CIO Responsibilities</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> are ultimately responsible
for successfully executing their role in the enterpriseÂ«s mission.
How central this role is to the strategic plans of the enterprise
will depend on each of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> critical success factors, but
support from the top and all efforts to build credibility will be
futile unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is run effectively. If the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> is not able to execute its responsibilities, and if it
is not able to play the critical role for which it has been
developed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> will learn to work around it, or it will
be replaced.
There are many aspects to successfully organizing and running a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. However, this critical success factor, as well as
the underlying principles, focuses on the elements that leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> believe are most central to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s responsibility.
Determination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> structure must fall to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>, as he or she is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senior executive</ENAMEX> of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. Aligning
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> with the needs of the enterprise is critical
to the satisfaction of those needs. Communicating enterprise
requirements to staff and making appropriate decisions to meet the
needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> are the responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>. As the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> organizationÂ«s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> in strategic decision-making
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forums</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> must be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> of those strategies into CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> initiatives.
Along with technology, human capital is the central resource the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> has to execute his or her responsibilities. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> is
accountable for and reviews technology decisions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> from
business areas may develop most of the investment proposals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>
capital plans for the information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and technology area
are seen as the particular responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>. In the
current IT environment, technology has become a commodity. The
human capital involved in applying that technology to achieve the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> of the enterprise is a resource that requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s
attention. The hiring, retention, and training of information
management and technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> is seen by leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> as a fundamental principle of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> practice.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Principle V</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organize Information Resources</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet Business</ENAMEX>
Needs
Æ’While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> is important, it is the operating environment for
the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that will make it successful.â‰ˆ

Developing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is an ongoing process that demands
a clear understanding of the organizationÂ«s responsibility for
helping meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> needs. This responsibility, along with parent
business processes, market trends, internal legacy structures, and
available IT skills, drives decisions as to the structure of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is aligned with the rest
of the enterprise. Ultimately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> controls the assignment of
information technology and management functions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>, the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, and other organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. Once these decisions
are made, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> must provide effective, responsive
support through efficient allocation of resources and the
day-to-day execution of its responsibilities. This principle
examines the practices that leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> commonly use in
establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to effectively meet their mission
needs.

Key Characteristics
It is the duty of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> to manage expectations and help ensure
that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> have a clear understanding
of their responsibilities. In leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, evolving
business processes play a key role in determining how these
information management responsibilities are structured and adapted
to meet changing needs. We found that leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> quickly
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reallocate</ENAMEX> and make information resources available on a routine,
sometimes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> basis to address changes in business
processes. External factors, such as market trends, changing
technology, and available skills as well as internal legacy
structures and corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ventures</ENAMEX>, also influence how a CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> is formed, aligned, and adjusted to help support the
rest of an enterprise. For example, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that we
studied had experienced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mergers that required the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to
quickly integrate the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and restructure to meet
growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> needs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human resources</ENAMEX> systems were consolidated
and new corporate structures were quickly defined to ensure
continued support to the enlarged customer base. The company
remains prepared to restructure to meet ever-changing business
requirements.
In lieu of establishing either completely centralized or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decentralized CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> manage their
information resources through a combination of such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. In
this hybrid, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> assigns central control to a corporate CIO and
supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, while delegating specific authority to
each business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> for managing its own unique information
management requirements. The corporate CIO and supporting CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> centrally formulate policies and standards for all
IT-related activities. They also centrally manage architectures and
a core set of infrastructure components to provide common IT
services to the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>. The corporate CIO works with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> or other information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in each of the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to
ensure efficient, reliable, and interoperable technology for the
entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>. The following figure illustrates traditional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centralized</ENAMEX> and decentralized organizational structures, in
comparison with the hybrid combination used by leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Comparison of Decentralized, Centralized, and Hybrid</ENAMEX>
Structures

Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> decide, as part of a sourcing strategy,
whether to provide specific information technology and management
services with in-house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> or external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. An
organizationÂ«s sourcing strategy is part of a larger human capital
development strategy, which is discussed in principle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VI</ENAMEX>. The
shortage of skilled IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in the current market environment is
often a major reason for leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to outsource. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and decision-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> decide what type of work is
appropriate to outsource and what type of work is best performed
internally. Typically, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> cultivate long-term
skills such as contract management, project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and
security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, while outsourcing short-term skills such as
application development. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX> that we
visited is home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 600</NUMEX> software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. IT skills are in
great demand which made hiring by the state difficult, so this CIO
looked for alternatives to in-house software development and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. It made sense for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to outsource tactical
functions such as help desks and mainframe management.
On the other hand, there are responsibilities such as IT
planning and oversight that must remain in-house. As the state
contracts out more of its information technology and management
functions, it is also essential that it have good contract
management expertise.
Along with effective allocation of available resources, leading
organizations execute their information management responsibilities
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliably</ENAMEX> and efficiently. Technology is highly integrated with the
business processes in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> because technology is
viewed as an enabler for the business, not just a tool. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> make IT investment decisions based on business case
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> and return-on-investment projections. Consistent with a
fundamental strategic information management approach, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> also focus on continuous process improvement. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> provide reliable information management capabilities
on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis, but also look to the future by pursuing new
initiatives that show how technology can improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> that we interviewed said that
his role was to identify enterprisewide and strategic initiatives
to improve state information <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> initiative involved
establishing strategic direction, guidelines, and standards for
instituting electronic commerce in the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Electronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX> was to be used for such activities as renewing licenses
and paying taxes.
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> simplify projects by producing incremental
deliverables that quickly show success and demonstrate the impact
of effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> while still focusing on long-term
objectives. As discussed in principle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, carrying out successful
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> is expected in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and adds to the
credibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.

Case Study: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizing Information Resources</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Meet Business</ENAMEX>
Needs
Implementing a combination of centralized and decentralized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> enables leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to effectively
support their business operations. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> leading organization
implements a combination of centralized and decentralized IT and
structures to best meet the needs of its three diverse lines of
businessâˆšan international services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, an international
industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>, and a retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> uses a
centralized IT infrastructure with decentralized development
efforts to provide efficiency and security for its corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Efficiency is the number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> priority of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> in terms of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> spent as well as technology
performance.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has CIOs in each of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
Each business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> makes IT investment decisions based on business
requirements and the technology available to support those
requirements. For example, desktop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> and software vary
among business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> depending on the unique needs of each business
area. The work in the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> is all performed in-house and
is not outsourced, as business expertise is considered a core
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">competency</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> CIOs work together to determine how IT can
be used to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> across business lines. The international
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> and international industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> have some common
requirements based on the international nature of the two
divisions. The international industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> and the retail
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX> have common requirements based on the specific industry.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> work together, leveraging opportunities
for shared IT products and services so that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> can invest
fewer dollars to accommodate common needs.
The corporate IT organizationÂ«s role is to aggregate needs
across business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and provide solutions that can be integrated
to serve the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>. Common components of each business
area include data centers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human resources</ENAMEX>, payroll, a financial
architecture, and a common desktop environment. Standard processes
and tools, such as contingency planning, interdependency
identification, protocols, and risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, are used to
coordinate multiple business areas. These standard utilities
evolved through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> corporate mergers and are now institutionalized
across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>. The mergers required that the organization
quickly adopt new organizational structures and address new
business requirements. The standard processes and policies
developed, applied, and improved as a result of the mergers provide
this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> with the flexibility it needs to adapt to future
changes in responsibility.
This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is constantly looking to improve its IT
investment processes. All technology investments are justified
using business case analyses. The decision-making process for
establishing business cases recently evolved to include competitive
needs. Competitive needs were not considered when this organization
initially postponed electronic commerce initiatives due to low
return-on-investment projections. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> fell behind the
competition in providing this service and the delay may have cost
it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. As a result, competitive needs are now considered
part of the decision-making process.



Strategies to Consider
An effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is a dynamic structure, responding
not only to business, mission, and cultural requirements, but also
to rapidly changing technologies, elusive skills, and competing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> in the external market environment. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
recognize the myriad forces driving their IT capabilities. The
following is an outline of the strategies that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
consider in deciding how to effectively structure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, and
execute their technology management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
Create a clear understanding of responsibilities within the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> by


â€¢
articulating a common description of responsibilities to
all levels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, and



â€¢
assigning responsibilities to parts of the organization
based on skills and organizational structure.

Use a combination of centralized and decentralized
organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> by


â€¢
centrally formulating policy and standards for all
IT-related activities, and providing common IT services through a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centrally</ENAMEX> managed infrastructure; and



â€¢
delegating authority to the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to manage
individual information management requirements.

Create an adaptable organizational structure by



â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redeploying</ENAMEX> internal resources to quickly address
changing business and customer requirements.

Select appropriate sourcing strategies by


â€¢
considering outsourcing noncore responsibilities to
address the shortage of skilled IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in the current market
environment, and



â€¢
keeping core competencies in-house.

Execute CIO responsibilities efficiently by


â€¢
providing reliable and efficient IT services and
products,


â€¢
making IT investment decisions based on business case
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> and return-on-investment, projections, and


â€¢
producing incremental deliverables to demonstrate results
while still focusing on longterm objectives.

As is true with the other principles, the business requirements
of an enterprise drive decisions related to the specific types of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> needed to implement technology successfully. External
market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and internal legacies influence the types of skills
available to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. Given these realities, the CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> must provide an effective, responsive IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> to
help accomplish missions and goals. This principle discusses the
strategies that leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> use to assess their skill
bases and attract, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruit</ENAMEX>, and retain IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Association of America</ENAMEX>. Needed skills are compared
with existing capabilities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to determine gaps in
the IT skills base. For example, the state university at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our
case study locations had conducted a study revealing continuing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX> in the stateÂ«s ability to recruit and retain IT workers
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vis-Ã </ENAMEX>-vis industry. In response to the governorÂ«s initiative to
expand the stateÂ«s IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>, proposals were made for a program
to recruit and fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> and university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> willing to
study technology management as a prelude to becoming part of the
state governmentÂ«s labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. Strengthening the skills and
capabilities of IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> through training and innovative
hiring practices is part of a formula for building information
technology and management capabilities.
Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> sometimes use surveys that compare missing
capabilities with market availability to determine what skills to
acquire through hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> with the
necessary skills cannot be hired, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> supplement
the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> with external information resources. More
specifically, they cultivate expertise in their internal
workforces, while outsourcing skills that are available from
multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> at lower cost. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> may even
choose to replace labor with technology when they cannot hire the
skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> they need. Core information management
functions include project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and
contract management practices that can apply to a variety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>. The various staffing and sourcing strategies provide
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> with dynamic workforces that can quickly
carry out these functions to meet changing business needs.
Studies forecast an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ever-increasing</ENAMEX> shortage of IT
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, presenting a great challenge for both industry and
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX> are finding it difficult to
retain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> when their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> can always offer higher
salaries. For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> CIO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that
we studied experienced a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 percent</NUMEX> turnover in IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.
Despite having higher technology wages than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> at a disadvantage in competing with
industry and must rely on alternative strategies and incentives to
attract and retain skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.
While benefits, recognition, and challenging responsibilities
are also useful in securing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> identify
training as a major nonsalary incentive for attracting and
retaining skilled IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> dedicate
an increasing percentage of their IT budgets to training. Sometimes
such funds are devoted to retraining existing nontechnical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to supply them with IT expertise. For example, one
industry case study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> sponsors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3-month</TIMEX> course to
retrain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</NUMEX> legacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in project management skills.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> also offers a range of formal classroom training, less
formal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workshops</ENAMEX>, and informal mentoring programs. Given the change
management environment for IT in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> always wants
and needs to be in a learning mode. Similarly, another industry CIO
told us that he provides IT training through a program that pays
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of their salaries while they attend
school. Upon completion of training, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> each earn <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
percent of their salary during an initial performance evaluation
period, and full salary at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of that period</TIMEX>.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> are accountable for
creating opportunities for their employeesÂ« training, individual
staff are responsible for taking advantage of those opportunities.
In general, leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> provide training as part of a
changing high-tech work environment that includes state-of-the-art
tools and methods allowing skilled IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to perform their jobs
to the best of their ability.
We identified additional strategies that leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
use to enhance their information management workforces.
Specifically, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> bring in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with desirable
skills from across the enterprise to work in conjunction with IT
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, thereby maximizing the capability of their technical
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> make up cross-functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that
provide an appropriate mix of business expertise and IT skills to
accomplish the various tasks of a project. Working together, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> reflect the interests of not just information technology
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user community</ENAMEX> and the projectÂ«s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, and provide a holistic blend of technical, project
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, value management, budget, finance, and procurement
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and capabilities to meet mission needs.


Case Study: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Developing Information Management Human</ENAMEX>
Capital
Using a variety of staffing and sourcing strategies provides
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> with dynamic workforces that can quickly meet
changing business needs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> leading companyÂ«s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> said that
recruiting information management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> with special skills in
areas such as data networks and systems <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is extremely
competitive. To be successful in recruiting, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has
devised different offer packages to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. A package
might include accelerated salary schedules or stock options. Once
hired, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> sends these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> back to college for IT
training and invests in them. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> acknowledges, however, that
his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> does not spend enough on training. Currently,
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 1 percent</NUMEX> of the IT operating budget is devoted to
training.
This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> also provides training to new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
through a program that pays <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of the employeeÂ«s salary
while he or she attends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. Upon completion of training, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> enters a performance evaluation period during which the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">employee</ENAMEX> earns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> of his or her salary. After successfully
completing the performance evaluation period, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> then
begins earning a full salary.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> increased its salary base to compete with other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in retaining and attracting talented information
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management workers</ENAMEX>. Besides salaries, company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> view a good
working environment and awards and recognition as essential for
retaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> took over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> to a five-star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> out to celebrate the
groupÂ«s accomplishments. When senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> appreciate business
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accomplishments</ENAMEX>, they are willing to spend funds for staff
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> admits that his IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are constantly
asked to work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long hours</TIMEX> and undergo a lot of stress though they
get little in return for the amount of work they do.
This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> believes that money is not the only motivator for IT
staff. He feels that an important element to managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> is
finding ways to recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and say Æ’thank you.â‰ˆ When the
thank you comes from inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, it goes a long way.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> uses different means to show his appreciation. For
instance, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> publishes a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> appreciation newsletter
through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intranet</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> believes there is big payoff in these
types of activities and the costs are minimal, if any. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> also
views time off as a good incentive bonus because it does not cost
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> very much. Other incentives his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has undertaken
include taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> out for lunch or handing out <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> American
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Express</ENAMEX> checks. In todayÂ«s environment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have to be
creative. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> created a thank you toolkit to show
her appreciation to her staff. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, Æ’If you donÂ«t have a
lot of money to spend, you have to ask yourself, what are the
little things you can do to show your appreciation.â‰ˆ



Strategies to Consider
Given the increasing shortage of IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> in the current
market environment, securing an effective, responsive technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management workforce</ENAMEX> is a challenging task for both business and
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> alike. Leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have
identified the following strategies that help in assessing their IT
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and recruiting, retaining, and utilizing talent to meet
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> needs. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> consider and apply the
various strategies as appropriate within the organizational,
financial, and cultural parameters of their individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> and
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX>.
Assess the skill base by


â€¢
determining expertise needed to perform information
management responsibilities, and



â€¢
identifying gaps between skills available and skills
needed.

Identify innovative ways to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> by


â€¢
providing good benefits packages, and



â€¢
building core competencies.

Provide training, tools, and methods to help retain expertise,
including


â€¢
directing an increasing percentage of the budget to fund
training,


â€¢
evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to make sure they are achieving the
desired technical skills,


â€¢
holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> accountable for providing training
opportunities for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX>, and



â€¢
providing a high-tech environment of tools and
methodologies for skilled IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.

Employ alternative methods and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for supplying talent,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€¢ outsourcing</ENAMEX> and supplementing the existing workforce
with external expertise,


â€¢
bringing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> with desirable skills from across
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> to work with and help maximize the capability of
information technology and management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, and


â€¢
replacing labor with technology.






Using <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Guide</ENAMEX>
The principles and practices we developed based on our
interviews with leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in the private sector and
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> have enabled us to construct a framework to guide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. In our discussions with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> of major federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> of
small federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, we found that they generally agree with the
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> on the fundamental management principles for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and technology. At the same time, we found
that the practices used by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CIOs</ENAMEX> tend to differ from those
used by leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. We did not study the reasons for
these deviations specifically, although some likely result from the
context in which federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> operate. Both operational and
structural aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s environment can vary significantly
between the public sector and the private sector.
Rather than dwell on differences, it is more useful to focus on
the considerable common ground between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and private CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> to build efforts for improvement. The specific key
conditions and strategies described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> can be used as
suggestions for federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> to apply or adapt to their
environments, as appropriate. More generally, the key conditions
and strategies can be thought of as addressing specific aspects of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> primary principles, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> from all sectors agree are
critical to the successful execution of their responsibilities and
realization of the potential benefits of information technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">investments</ENAMEX>. Taken as areas of focus, these aspects may be
evaluated by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and tackled using techniques
suited to their situations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> of the differences
described above, as well as others, should influence the
application of advice provided in this guide. But the advice of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> should remain relevant regardless of
the specifics of the situation.
The ideas presented in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> may also provide the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> for further discussion within the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
Many federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>, in the normal course of their own efforts, have
already begun working along the lines of the advice provided in
this guide. These CIOs have gained valuable insights into applying
the practices of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Council</ENAMEX>, or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> of federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>, can create an
opportunity for sharing these experiences, using the principles
described in this guide as an organizing framework. The challenge
of understanding how the federal context influences the
effectiveness of the principle may be best met with support from
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> who work in the same context.
In addition, the specific key conditions and strategies
described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> will provide insight when considering areas
of future study. For example, specific principles may be
investigated more deeply and strategies for implementing a
principle, such as developing information technology human capital,
may be proposed in more detail. Or those aspects of the federal CIO
environment that constrain the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> flexibility and hinder
the ability to perform effectively may be examined more closely,
and specific strategies to cope with those aspects may be proposed.
Understanding how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> approach their
work, and acknowledging those aspects of the federal CIO
environment that limit the ability to implement similar strategies,
may prompt congressional and executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> discussions about the
need for future legislation and policy changes.
A few dimensions in which the federal and private sector can
differ are described below. These examples largely stem from the
nature of the public sector in which federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> operate. Many of
these examples were mentioned by federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> interviewed for this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX>. However, the extent to which the differences create
additional constraints on the CIOs depends on how they and agency
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> respond to them.


â€¢
Senior executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> can
differ significantly from the private sector. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> head is a
political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointee</ENAMEX> who often is more focused on policy issues than
on internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and operations. This can deny the CIO the
Æ’CEOâ‰ˆ support that is so critical for the successful integration of
information technology into business or mission
functions.


â€¢
The budget decision-making process used for information
technology projects can present particular challenges for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal CIO</ENAMEX> not found in the private sector. For example,
legislative actions, such as tax law changes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> payment
process changes, may require extensive system modifications, and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> does not have the flexibility to decide whether or not to
pursue them. This ties up resources that might otherwise have been
expended differently. In fact, mandated projects often must be
funded by money that had been planned for other projects. Long-term
investment strategies are difficult because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are asked to
put together funding requests <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1824 months</TIMEX> in advance of funding
availability. In addition, IT funds may be contained within the
appropriations for a specific program or an overall administrative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>, making them less visible and, if part of discretionary
spending, more subject to volatile changes in the federal budget.
As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> may not have control or direct oversight over
much of the IT funding within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>.


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personnel</ENAMEX> decisions in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> are often
constrained due to work rules or organizational factors. Current
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> job descriptions do not match the
occupations recognized in the industry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Training funds are
often limited due to larger budget considerations. Recently, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personnel Management</ENAMEX> (OPM) found salaries in the federal
government to be lower than in the private sector. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 3</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> OPM implemented a governmentwide policy increasing salaries in
several IT categories in an effort to make federal employment more
competitive. Because this policy was recently implemented, we
cannot yet assess the impact of these changes on federal employment
practices.


â€¢
The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> may direct an organizational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in
which duties that would typically be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOÂ</ENAMEX>«s responsibility in the
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> are not under his or her direction at all. For
example, some federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> are in charge of large policy and
oversight functions with little operational responsibility. While
this may be an appropriate model, it is critical that any model be
matched with the overall needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in mind.


â€¢
The range of responsibilities, as defined by legislation,
that accrue to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> are very broad in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX>,
including areas such as records <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom of</ENAMEX>
Information <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> requirements, for which there is little parallel in
the private sector. While federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CIOs</ENAMEX> often may not have
operational authority for the full range of responsibilities in the
legislation, they and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are still subject to oversight
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in many of these areas.


Though the environment faced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> in the federal sector
clearly differs from that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> in other contexts, the principles
that form the basis for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> remain relevant. The underlying
principles were observed consistently in our sample of leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, and were cited as being critical to the success of
their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal CIOs</ENAMEX> can learn from the successes of these
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and can apply the principles as appropriate
in their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. In addition, agency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> and other
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can gain an understanding
of their roles in executing the critical success factors that must
be addressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> work to meet the letter and intent of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clinger-Cohen Act</ENAMEX> and related legislation.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix I Federal Legislation Affecting Information</ENAMEX>

systems comply with federal financial management system
requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Standard General Ledger</ENAMEX> (SGL) in order to provide
uniform, reliable, and more useful financial information. The act
requires that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
named in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CFO Act</ENAMEX> report, as part of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> audits of the

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Law</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">104-106</ENAMEX>) Â¬ This law is
intended to improve the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness
of federal programs through the improved acquisition, use, and
disposal of IT resources. Among other provisions, it (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) encourages
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to evaluate and adopt best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and
acquisition practices used by both private and public sector
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to base decisions about IT investments on

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to demonstrate how well the IT expenditures support
improvements to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> programs, through measurements such as
reduced costs, improved employee productivity, and higher customer
satisfaction, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) requires executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to appoint CIOs
to carry out the IT management provisions of the act and the
broader information resources management requirements of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Clinger-Cohen Act</ENAMEX> also streamlines the
IT acquisition process by eliminating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AdministrationÂ«s</ENAMEX> central acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, placing procurement

applies life cycle management principles to information management
and focuses on reducing the governmentÂ«s information-collection
burden. To this end, PRA designated senior information resources
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager positions</ENAMEX> in the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with
responsibility for a wide range of functions. PRA also created the

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Appendix II Objectives, Scope</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodology</ENAMEX>
The objective of our research was to determine how several
leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have implemented their CIO positions and
supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> infrastructures. We were interested in
identifying effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> management practices used across a
variety of organization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. In doing so, we also
sought to develop specific case study information on how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> have
helped improve the effectiveness of their organizationsÂ« business
operations. We have used this information to develop suggested
guidance to assist federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in effectively integrating
newly created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> functions into their respective
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.
We synthesized a great deal of literature and research on CIO
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> to provide ideas on effective practices in
information technology and management. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of knowledge
served as a foundation for designing our project approach. We then
conducted case studies at a number of private and public
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>. We have found that case studies provide an abundant
source of information describing management practices and the
intellectual background that led to the development of those
practices. Case studies also provide the flexibility to pursue
particularly rich avenues of inquiry as they develop during
interviews. Finally, they are also an excellent means of
communicating the essence of practices that have worked well by
capturing the context as well as the specific practice.
We identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidate organizations</ENAMEX> for our study based on
awards and recognition from professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>. We conducted multi-day
visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that agreed to participate in our study to
learn


â€¢
each organizationÂ«s approach to selecting, positioning,
and defining the roles and responsibilities of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>;


â€¢
techniques for instituting IT policies and standards,
managing technical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and financial resources, building
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> relationships, and measuring the performance of
IT <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in meeting business needs; and



â€¢
strategies for promoting and facilitating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> and
organizational change through IT.

We visited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> private and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> public sector organizations
recognized as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in successfully managing information and
technology investments to create value and improve business
performance. We selected private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> across a range of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dimensions</ENAMEX>, including type of business, number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, and
revenues. All private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> contacted had received
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> by professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>,
corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, or independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. Our selection of
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> was based on recognition by professional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX>, state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Resource Executives</ENAMEX> (NASIRE). In particular, NASIRE
awards recognition to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have made important
contributions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> of state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. The following
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> participated in our study:


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of Texas</ENAMEX>


â€¢
State of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Bank</ENAMEX>


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corporation</ENAMEX>


â€¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.C. Penney</ENAMEX>


We also interviewed the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
and the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. West Communications</ENAMEX>, although we did
not conduct comprehensive case studies at these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
We conducted site visits to each participating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and
obtained supporting documentation, illustrations, and examples.
During the visits, we interviewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the senior
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, IT <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> as identified by
the host <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, to obtain their individual perspectives on
information and technology management issues. Based on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">documentation</ENAMEX> and interviews obtained from our site visits, we
compared practices across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to identify innovative
practices used by individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> as well as common
practices used across the variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> participating in
our study.
We subsequently interviewed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> CIO
Council <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> as a means of comparing federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> practices with
our case study results and ensuring that practices used in the
industry and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> also addressed the challenges
found in the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. We selected a mix of federal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> to visit, taking into consideration their various
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> types (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX>, military, or regulatory), centralized and
decentralized structures, and prior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> study results. Further, we
met with a panel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIOs</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> small federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to
determine whether the practices identified are also applicable
across diverse organizational sizes (based on dimensions such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, etc.). These discussions, which are summarized
in the section entitled Æ’Current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal CIO Environment</ENAMEX>,â‰ˆ helped
us identify similarities and differences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO</ENAMEX> management
practices of federal versus leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. The discussions
have also enabled us to pinpoint areas where federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can
benefit from integrating the practices of such leading
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> in their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
Our research was conducted from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> and
culminated in the issuance of an exposure draft in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX>.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX> we received comments from a variety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Based on suggestions from the
general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> we have considered and made changes to the text
where appropriate. General consensus of those providing input was
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIO Guide</ENAMEX> represented leading practices and that the
document was insightful and valuable.
