Rule)
Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 801</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)(A) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 5, United States Code</ENAMEX>,
this is our report on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rule 11AC1-4</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Limit Order Display Rule</ENAMEX>) and
Amendments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rule</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC1-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quote Rule</ENAMEX>) (RIN: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3235-AG66</TIMEX>)
promulgated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>. We received
the rule and amendments on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 9, 1996</TIMEX>. They were published
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 12, 1996</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48290</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> adopted the Limit Order <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Display Rule</ENAMEX> and amended
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quote Rule</ENAMEX> pursuant to its authority under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities</ENAMEX>
Exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1934</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. ยง</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">78a-78ll</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Limit Order Display Rule</ENAMEX> requires the public display of
customer limit orders priced better than an exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX>'s
or market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>'s quote. The rule also requires that specialists
and market makers add limit orders priced at their quote to the
size associated with their quote when that quote represents the
best marketwide price. The rule will set standard display
requirements for limit orders in all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96-43</NUMEX>
markets. The rule represents a major change for the handling of
limit orders in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> market where such orders have never been
displayed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> believes that the new rule will benefit
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> because the publication of trading interest at prices
that improve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>' and market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>' quotes presents
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> with improved execution opportunities and improved access
to best prices when they buy or sell securities.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> also adopted amendments to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quote Rule</ENAMEX> to
ensure that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> are fully informed of the best price at
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> or market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> are willing to trade a security.
Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> and market makers may privately display a
better price than their public quotations through certain private
trading systems in which priced orders are invisible and
inaccessible to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> at large. The amendment to the rule
benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> by bringing into public view the better prices
in these systems and by allowing all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> to trade at these
prices. In addition, the rule was amended to require that
substantial market makers for any security listed on an exchange
publish their quotations for that security. According to the
Commission, this benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> by enhancing the public
availability of prices for all listed securities, some of which
were not published before.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enclosed</ENAMEX> is our assessment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s compliance with
the procedural steps required by sections 801(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)(i) through
(iv) of title <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> with respect to the rule and amendments. Our review
indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> complied with the applicable
requirements.

(i)
Cost-benefit analysis

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> stated in its report to
us that it was not required to prepare, and did not prepare, a
cost-benefit analysis of the rule and rule amendments. Instead,
pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 23</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Securities Exchange Act</ENAMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. ยง</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">78w</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> is directed to consider
the impact that the rule may have on competition. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
stated that the competition analysis which it prepared provides
information very similar to that provided by a cost-benefit
analysis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> concluded that the rule and rule
amendments will not impose any unnecessary or inappropriate burdens
on competition.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 603</ENAMEX>: Initial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
In its <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">52792,</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 10, 1995</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> included a summary of its Initial
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.</ENAMEX> In accordance with sections
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">603</NUMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> describes the reasons for the
proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> actions and its objectives and legal basis. With
regard to sections 603(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii) and</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> states that
it uses certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commissionadopted</ENAMEX> definitions of "small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>"
for purposes of its analysis and concludes that it is unable to
quantify reasonably the impact that the proposed rule and
amendments would have on small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX>.
The summary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX> does
not address any other relevant federal rules that duplicate,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlap</ENAMEX>, or conflict with this rule and amendments as provided for
by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 603</ENAMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>).
Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> rejected the alternative of exempting
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> from the proposed rules and amendments.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 604</ENAMEX>: Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> published a summary of its Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 12, 1996</TIMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48325</NUMEX>) and provided us with a copy of the full text
of the analysis.
Pursuant to section 604a(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> provides a statement
of the need for, and objectives of, the rule and the rule
amendments. In accordance with section 604a(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>), it provides a
summary of the significant issues raised in the comments submitted
in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX> and its
reaction to those comments. It specifically addresses concerns
raised suggesting (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> should better quantify
the effects of the proposals on the market (especially the
anti-competitive effects) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s estimates
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. ยงย</ENAMEX>ง <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3501-3520</TIMEX>) were too
low. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> discusses how it amended the proposals in
response to these comments.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> discusses the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of small
entities that would be subject to this rulemaking and concludes
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker-dealers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 960</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Small
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">issuers</ENAMEX> could be affected by this rulemaking.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> describes the projected compliance requirements
of the rules and describes the steps taken to minimize the economic
impact on small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, including consideration of several
significant alternatives to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quote Rule</ENAMEX> and the Display
Rule. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> states that it believes that the rule and
amendments as adopted impose a smaller burden upon small brokers
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> than any of the alternatives.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> provides generally descriptive statements of the
effects of the rules as suggested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 607 of the Act</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> has informed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> that to encourage small
entities to participate in the rulemaking process as called for by
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 609</ENAMEX>, it distributed a "plain <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>" version of the
proposing release, it posted the proposals under the "Items of
Interest to Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Businesses</ENAMEX>" section of its Internet Web-site, it
met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that represent small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security Traders Association</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Specialists</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>, and its senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> gave speeches describing the
proposals and encouraging comments.
