published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> as a final rule on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 19</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Order amending Parts 2 and 15 of Title 47</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Code</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Regulations</ENAMEX>, deregulates the equipment
authorization requirements for personal computers and peripherals.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Order</ENAMEX> provides for a new selfauthorization process based on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX>'s declaration of compliance with all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>
requirements. The original certification procedure required
submission of a written application, test report and fee (and a
device for testing in some cases) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>
estimates that the new procedure will save industry approximately

required to prepare a cost-benefit analysis of the rule.

Agency actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility</ENAMEX>
Act, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C. Â§Â§</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">603-605</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">607 and 609</NUMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 603</ENAMEX>: Initial regulatory flexibility analysis
Pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 603 of the Act</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> incorporated
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX> in it Notice of Proposed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rule Making</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proposed Rule Making</ENAMEX> was published in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15116</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 22, 1995</TIMEX>. Our
review of the initial analysis indicates that the requirements of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 603</ENAMEX> have been met. At that time, written comments on the
proposal were requested. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> also reports that it
forwarded a copy of its initial regulatory flexibility analysis to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Counsel</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Advocacy</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX>) as required by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX>, and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> did not file
comments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 604</ENAMEX>: Final regulatory flexibility analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> prepared a Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ENAMEX>
pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 604</ENAMEX>. That analysis notes that the rule was
needed in order to reduce regulatory burdens on computer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>, to remove impediments to flexible systems design and
construction techniques, and to reduce the potential for
interference to radio services by improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s
ability to ensure that personal computers comply with the
Commission's standards and testing procedures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
further notes that no commenting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> raised issues specifically
in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, and
that no significant alternatives were considered.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 605</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Avoidance</ENAMEX> of duplicative or unnecessary
analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> did not invoke any of the exemptions or special
procedures authorized by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 605</ENAMEX> in preparing its regulatory
flexibility analysis.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section 607</ENAMEX>: Preparation of analyses
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 607</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s submission does not
specifically indicate the potential economic impact or the number
of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> affected. However, the initial regulatory
flexibility analysis indicates that the rule will result in a
significant decrease in the amount of testing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
authorization of computer systems with a resultant reduction in
economic burden. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> notes that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-150
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of various component devices but does not indicate
what the ratio of large to small business might be in this mix.
