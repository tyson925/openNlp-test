<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">INTERIM FINAL RULES WITH REQUEST FOR COMMENTS"</ENAMEX> (RIN: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0960-AE57</ENAMEX>)
(i) Cost-benefit analysis
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Administration</ENAMEX> performed a cost-benefit
assessment of the impact of the interim final rule. The assessment,
which is summarized in the preamble to the rule in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register</ENAMEX>, was submitted to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> in its entirety.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> estimates that reduced program outlays resulting from the
rule will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.7 billion dollars</NUMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 6 years</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$34.7</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billion</ENAMEX> spent during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that 6-year</TIMEX> period on childhood disability
benefits. In addition, it is estimated that there will be a
reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> program outlays of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$590 million</NUMEX> during that
period.
The cost of conducting the medical redeterminations is expected
to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$185 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1997</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$130 million</NUMEX> in fiscal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 1998</TIMEX>. After that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> estimates that administrative costs
will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> less each year from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999 through 2002</TIMEX>.
The redeterminations are expected to result in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
having benefits terminated as a result of these changes in the
law.
The assessment also discusses the costs involved in two
alternatives that were considered but were found not to adequately
reflect the intent of the legislation, as reflected by the
legislative history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Law</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>-193.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ENAMEX>,

The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> has certified that the interim final rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> since the rule only affects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO/OGC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-23</NUMEX>
(iii) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> actions relevant to sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">205</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Â§Â</ENAMEX>§ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1532-1535</TIMEX>
The interim final rule does not impose any unfunded mandates
upon <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, local or tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> or the private sector under
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.

executive orders

The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> determined under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> Â<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 553</NUMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) that good
cause existed for dispensing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice of Proposed</ENAMEX> Rulemaking
procedures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Administrative Procedure Act</ENAMEX> and has issued the
rule as an interim final rule with a request for comments by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 1997</TIMEX>. Since sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">211 and 212</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Law</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">104-193</ENAMEX> were
effective upon enactment and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 215</ENAMEX> required the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commissioner</ENAMEX>
to issue regulations to carry out the amendments within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX>
after enactment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> found that it would be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">impracticable</ENAMEX> and contrary to congressional intent to follow the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPRM</ENAMEX> procedures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSA</ENAMEX> will consider the comments received by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 14, 1997</TIMEX>, and
will issue revised regulations if necessary.

The rule contains a new information collection requirement which
was submitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>) under
emergency procedures and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> has approved the collection
requirements and issued OMB No. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0960-0568</TIMEX>.
The new collection of information is the completion of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Childhood Disability Evaluation Form</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Disability</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Determination Services</ENAMEX>. The submission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> lists the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX>
usage rate of the form at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 800,000</NUMEX> and there is a
one-time disability redetermination workload of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">266,000</NUMEX> to be
processed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. The submission estimates the burden per response
to be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> for an annual hour burden of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">355,333</NUMEX>. The cost to
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8.7 million</NUMEX>.
