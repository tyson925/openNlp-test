<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Introduction

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>. Scope and Purpose
It is widely believed that it costs more to provide rural areas
with postal service than urban areas. This belief is based
primarily on the perception of a cost differential between rural
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> This perception is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> for the
argument that a universal service requirement is necessary to
assure the continuation of rural delivery or at least the level of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">service</ENAMEX> currently accorded rural areas.2
The purpose of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to analyze rural delivery costs and
compare them with city delivery costs. Using routine cost data
submitted in the course of postal rate proceedings, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 2</ENAMEX> of
this paper compares the cost of rural and urban delivery, Section 3
shows the relationship of rural delivery cost to population
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">density, Section 4</ENAMEX> analyzes the "profitability" (viz., contribution
to overhead) of serving rural areas, and Section 5 presents some
concluding remarks and a brief summary. Before turning to Section
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, some background information on rural delivery and city delivery
is offered.
The views expressed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and
do not necessarily represent the opinions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate</ENAMEX>
Commission.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1991 Comprehensive Statement</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
Operations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 66</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USPS</ENAMEX> delivery costs represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of
total costs; window service and mail processing, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 percent</NUMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX>; and administrative, building occupancy,
and all other, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31 percent</NUMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> focuses on the detailed comparison of delivery costs,
between rural and urban areas. It does not purport to show the
bearing, if any, this cost analysis might have on questions
regarding the complex issue of the postal monopoly, which
encompasses many issues beyond the scope of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>. Relation of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rural Routes to Demographically Designated</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Areas</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> times as many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery
letter routes as rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>. City delivery routes serve
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> locations within the boundaries of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> routes generally serve areas falling outside these
boundaries<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX> and rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> are in separate labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>,
and their compensation is determined separately based on different
factors.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Census Bureau</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1990</ENAMEX> data) reports that
slightly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">under 25 percent</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> live in rural areas.4 The remainder live in urban
locations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5,6,7</NUMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> postal system provided service to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX>
million delivery points. City <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> served <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78.5 million</NUMEX> and rural
routes (including contract routes) served <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23.4 million</NUMEX> delivery
points<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8,9</NUMEX> A total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">95 million</NUMEX> delivery points
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and the areas served by their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">post offices</ENAMEX>
often expand to absorb surrounding areas served by rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>. It
takes a great deal of time to administratively convert a rural
route to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery route. Thus, some rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> will serve
areas annexed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and their post <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> As defined for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> census, urban areas include: (a)
places of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> incorporated as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, boroughs (except <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> (except
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>), but excludes
those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> living in the rural portions of extended <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>; (b)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">census</ENAMEX> designated places of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>; and (c)
other areas, incorporated or unincorporated, included in urbanized
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. All non-urban areas are rural.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census Bureau</ENAMEX> reports that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,619</NUMEX>
incorporated places with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Postal Service</ENAMEX> provided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,625</NUMEX> post
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, but not all were in incorporated areas.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> has estimated that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.5 percent</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the more developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> would live in rural areas

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
Highway contract routes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> routes) are similar to rural
routes. The difference is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>, not an employee. Contract routes serve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4 million</NUMEX>
delivery points.
are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX>; the remainder are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>. Thus, rural (and
highway contract) routes serve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">slightly less than 25 percent</NUMEX> of
total residential delivery points; this is the same as the
percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> living in rural areas.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>. Description of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural and City Delivery</ENAMEX>
All rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> to deliver to a box placed along
the roadside, and virtually all provide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-day-a-week</TIMEX> delivery. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> route is defined in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> it traverses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homes</ENAMEX> or
businesses not located on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> must place a mail
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">receptacle</ENAMEX> along the route traveled. For this reason, boxes will
frequently be clustered where a rural route intersects <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> not on
the route. In this sense, rural service is inferior to city
delivery where service is provided to (or in close proximity to)
each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> served.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery routes are "<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>-and-loop" routes. The
carrier on these routes uses a vehicle to drive to various points
along the route where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> dismounts and delivers to a
portion of the route on foot. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery routes, called
"curb line routes," use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> to provide curbside delivery to a
mail receptacle along the curb as is done by rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX>
type of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery route is the "foot route."
City <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> are further categorized as "business,"
"residential," and "mixed" (business and residential) routes.
Business routes (consisting of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 70 percent</NUMEX> business
deliveries), which account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> percent of all
possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> deliveries<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,10</NUMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-day</TIMEX>-per<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-week</TIMEX> routes. Mail on
all other city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> is delivered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days a week</TIMEX>. Very few routes
service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> exclusively. For example, on
residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> (which account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94 percent</NUMEX> of all possible
city deliveries), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</NUMEX> of possible
deliveries. The percentage of possible deliveries on rural routes
that are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> is not known. Although the activities of city
and rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> are similar, some minor differences exist:
-rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> spend about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">three percent</NUMEX> of their total time
providing retail services
10
"Possible delivery" is used to describe a household or business
address (including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suites</ENAMEX>) to which mail might be
delivered by city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>. "Box" is used to describe the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">receptacles</ENAMEX> each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or business sets up on a rural route to
which mail might be delivered. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> terms stand for similar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concepts</ENAMEX> and for purposes of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> are used
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interchangeably</ENAMEX>.
(e.g., selling postage stamps, rating and receiving parcels,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>);
-city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> provide no retail services;
-rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> transport mail to and from small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">post offices</ENAMEX>
along their route; and
-city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> sweep more collection boxes along their routes
than do rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>.



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Comparison of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cost of City and Rural Delivery</ENAMEX>

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>. Comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Carrier Time Required to Serve City</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Areas</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> shows that the average time per day per possible
delivery is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.04 minutes</TIMEX> for city <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">delivery11 and 1.07 minutes</TIMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> delivery. (This small difference would be further reduced if
retail activities of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> were not counted.) The virtual
equality of the average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> time to serve urban and rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> is a major finding of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. Part of the explanation
for this finding can be inferred from table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> require
considerably more time per possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery than do
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residences</ENAMEX>.
The average possible delivery on business routes requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
times as much carrier time as the average possible delivery on
residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>. There are several reasons for this large
difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> time:
-Businesses receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost three</NUMEX> times as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> per
possible delivery as do <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX>. The statistics shown in table 1
(row <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) reflect both in-office and out-of-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> delivery time<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX>
In-office time is closely related to volume.
-In business areas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> travel by foot, and many deliver in
large office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suites</ENAMEX>.
11
This analysis includes only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery letter routes. It
excludes parcel post and support routes which primarily serve
business <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> in larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>.
12
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX> and rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> typically spend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between three and four</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in the office preparing for delivery.

Reflects the fact that business routes receive service only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> per week.
-There are no curb delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> in business areas. Curb
routes are suitable only for residential areas. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> (row <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
shows that they require less time than either foot or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>-and-loop
routes.
On the other hand, a direct comparison of rural to city
residential delivery reveals that rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> time per possible
delivery is only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent greater than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> residential route
delivery time. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven</ENAMEX> percent higher if retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> costs are
eliminated from rural.) There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> major reasons for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> route time per possible delivery being so close to the
corresponding time for city residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>:
-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> routes are the functional equivalent of curbline city
delivery, the most efficient form of city residential delivery.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Curbline</ENAMEX> routes, however, account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 21 percent</NUMEX> of city
residential possible deliveries.
-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> routes have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 4.3</NUMEX> pieces per possible delivery, while
city residential routes have
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.8</NUMEX>. Thus they incur less in-office costs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>
-As described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> who do not live along the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> route must place a mail receptacle along the rural route.
Thus, rural mail boxes tend to cluster where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> (not on the
route) intersect with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>'s route. A rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> can
serve a cluster of boxes much faster than if the individual boxes
were spread out along the route where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> would have to
slow down, stop, and accelerate for each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
Thus far, we have examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> time per possible delivery or
per box. We now turn to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> time per piece delivered. Table
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (row <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> time per piece delivered is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> per piece for all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12.2 seconds</TIMEX> for residential
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. This contrasts with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14.9 seconds</TIMEX> per piece for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>.
Thus, on a delivered piece basis, rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> use <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> more
carrier time than do all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> routes, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 percent</NUMEX> more than city
residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>. The major explanation for this is fewer average
pieces per possible delivery per day for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> (row <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
13
Part of the reason for the difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> per possible
delivery may be due to the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</NUMEX> of possible
residential deliveries are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and it is thought, but not
known, that a lesser percentage of possible deliveries on rural
routes are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>. Labor Cost
The previous section compared <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and rural delivery on the
basis of time. This section estimates postal labor delivery cost
that corresponds to units of time in order to convert time into
money in subsequent sections.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> uses both full-time regular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> and
casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than</NUMEX> full-time or temporary) on its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> routes. Casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are paid lower wages and have fewer
fringe benefits. Consequently, their cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> is
far less than for full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>.
Full-time rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>' compensation is slightly lower than
full-time city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>. They incur less overtime and the rural
carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX> has a higher proportion of casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. As
a result, rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> labor cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>
averaged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20.60</NUMEX> per work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34.3¢</NUMEX> per minute<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.14,15</NUMEX> In
contrast, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> labor cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24.49</NUMEX>
per work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40.8¢</NUMEX> per minute<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX>
The difference in labor costs for rural and city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> has
its roots in the development of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crafts. In another postal
system there might be no differences in the compensation of city
and rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> or it might be much larger. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, rural wages are generally lower than urban wages.
For purposes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and rural delivery cost analysis, we
present (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a comparison using the actual labor costs of the two
crafts, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) a comparison using the average labor costs of all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> collective bargaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. This will allow
both an actual cost analysis and a resource comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> routes. The average labor cost per bargaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> employee
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$24.09</NUMEX> per work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40.2¢</NUMEX> per minute<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX> This is
very close to the average city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> cost.

maintenance, repairs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>, for which they are paid an
allowance<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> received an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cents</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX> as a motor vehicle allowance. The average length of
a rural route is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">55 miles</NUMEX>. The average annual cost per rural route
is shown in table 2.
Those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> who make use of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> are
furnished with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> which also provides all
maintenance, repairs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>. City <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> drive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 15</NUMEX>

This is also shown in table 2.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> vehicle cost per box or possible delivery is twice the

<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX> combines labor cost with vehicle cost for city and rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>. It shows that when vehicle costs are added, the
difference in cost per box per day between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and rural carriers
depends heavily on which labor cost is used. Using actual labor
costs, the city cost per box per day is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5 percent</NUMEX> higher. Using

lower. On a cost<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-per</NUMEX>-piece basis, city costs are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX> lower

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Relation of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rural Delivery Cost to Population Density</ENAMEX>
A priori, population density should have an important effect on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> delivery cost. We have no data available which directly
relate rural delivery cost to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> density, but it seems very
likely that boxes per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX> is highly correlated with population
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>.
In order to examine the impact of density on cost, rural routes
have been divided into quintiles based on boxes per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 4</ENAMEX>
displays the relevant data. It can be seen that there is
wide variation between the quintiles. In the extreme, the
average number of boxes per route differs by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. The
average number of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> differs by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>. Average boxes
per mile differ by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>. Moreover, with the exception
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> evaluated time and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> pieces delivered per box, the
average values of all variables change monotonically. Thus, they
are correlated with boxes per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 4</ENAMEX>
Distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rural Routes by Density</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boxes per Mile</ENAMEX>)

a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See Appendix</ENAMEX> A for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or least densely populated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quintile</ENAMEX> stands out from
the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>. Its time per box is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> again larger than the
mean for all rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> and it is nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations
greater than the mean for all rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>. The other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
quintiles are less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> standard deviation from the mean.
Moreover, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quintile</ENAMEX> stands apart in that its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>
per piece is also nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations greater than the
mean, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other four</NUMEX> are all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than one</NUMEX> standard deviation
from the mean<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> measures of cost for the first
quintile are substantially greater than for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other four</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quintiles</ENAMEX>. This will be seen clearly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 4</ENAMEX>, where the
profitability of rural delivery is calculated for each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quintile</ENAMEX>.
It would not be surprising to find that the percentage of boxes
which are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> increases as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> density increases. If
this is true, it could at least partially explain why the number of
pieces delivered per box is so much larger for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
quintile than it is for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.
Finally, the variability (or elasticity) of time with respect to
volume for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quintiles</ENAMEX> differs greatly:
All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1st 2nd 3rd 4th</ENAMEX> 5th <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Routes</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">.29 .37 .44 .53 .57 .44</NUMEX>
Thus, for example, if the volume in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> quintile were to
double, total cost would increase by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 percent</NUMEX>. The variation
between quintiles can be explained by greater fixed costs in the
less densely populated quintiles than in the more populated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quintiles</ENAMEX>. The time required to drive the route is fixed, and
driving time represents a greater proportion of total cost in the
less densely populated quintiles.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> displays the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> per box per day as a function of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">density</ENAMEX>. It can be seen that time per box drops off sharply at the
low end of the density spectrum and then it flattens.
20
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> evaluated time per box for all routes (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1.07 minutes</TIMEX>)
has a standard deviation of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.30 minutes</TIMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> evaluated time
per piece for all routes (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14.94 seconds</TIMEX>) has a standard deviation
of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4.64 seconds</TIMEX>.

In order to isolate the effect of density on time per box, the
elasticity of time per box with respect to density has been
calculated using the route evaluation factors (which are used to
determine rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> pay). Holding constant the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> per rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">box</ENAMEX> and route <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>, a one <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> increase in density reduces
out-of-office time per box by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.44 percent</NUMEX> and total time per box
by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.27 percent</NUMEX>.21
21
The relation between time per box and boxes per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX> (density)
is exponential, or linear in logarithms. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pearson</ENAMEX> correlation
coefficient between the logarithmic values of the two variables is
-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78.60 percent</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">econometrically</ENAMEX> estimated constant elasticity
coefficient of a simple log- linear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with time per box as the
dependent variable and boxes per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX> as the explanatory variable
is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-27.45 percent</NUMEX> with a t value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-266.22</NUMEX>.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. "Profitability" <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">of Serving Rural</ENAMEX> Areas22
This section addresses the question: Does the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> find it remunerative to serve rural areas? A
revenue/cost model of rural delivery has been constructed to
determine the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">profitability23</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,24</NUMEX> of rural delivery by quintile. Its
simple structure is presented below:
Model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calculating Profit</ENAMEX> (Loss) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Per Box</ENAMEX>

22
"Profit" here means contribution to fixed overhead costs over
and above paying the fixed overhead of rural delivery.
23
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> presented here is valid only for an unsubsidized
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postal</ENAMEX> system such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>.
24
The simplifying assumption is made that there is no cost
difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and rural mail with respect to mail
processing, transportation, and retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>.
Line 1-the revenue per rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> per day is calculated by
multiplying average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> revenue per piece (from the
Revenue, Pieces and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weight Report</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>) times the average
number of pieces per box per day (from table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Line <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-rural
delivery cost per box per day consists of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) labor cost,
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) vehicle cost, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) indirect costs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> cost per box
is obtained by multiplying labor cost per minute (from Section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>)
by the average number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> per box (from table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Vehicle
cost per box per day are from table <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.26</NUMEX> Because there are two
labor costs per minute, one actual and the other theoretical, the
model is used separately for each labor cost and provides two
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> profit (loss) computations.
Line <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the model</TIMEX> takes into account the cost of getting
mail to the point of delivery (e.g., processing, transportation,
administrative, retail, etc.). This is done by bifurcating the
average attributable <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cost27</NUMEX> per piece into delivery attributable
cost28 and nondelivery attributable cost<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> cost and
the nondelivery attributable cost are then subtracted to arrive at
a profit (loss) per box per day.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Observers</ENAMEX> familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> costing
procedures will recognize that rural delivery cost per box includes
the attributable and institutional costs associated with that
function. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> found in the most recent omnibus rate case
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Docket R90-1</ENAMEX>), that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 percent</NUMEX> of rural delivery costs are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attributable</ENAMEX> (i.e., vary with volume) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61 percent</NUMEX> are
25
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Appendix</TIMEX> D presents indirect costs in more detail and shows how
they are calculated.
26
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Haldi</ENAMEX> has brought to our attention that the daily
vehicle cost per box is not the same for all quintiles, as was
assumed in an early version of the paper, but decreases with
population density. The estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> vehicle cost per box in the
revenue/cost model now recognizes the density differences among the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> quintiles:

27
Attributable costs are the postal costs causally traceable to
mail. They consist predominantly of volume variable costs. The
remaining costs are called institutional costs, and they can be
treated as fixed. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rate Commission</ENAMEX>
determines the attributable cost for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and subclass of
mail. Its most recent analysis is contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Docket R90-1</ENAMEX>
Opinion and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recommended Decision</ENAMEX>.
28
These are the attributable (direct and indirect) costs arising
from the delivery function. We have estimated them for purposes of
this analysis.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> These are total attributable costs minus delivery
attributable costs.
institutional (i.e., nonvariable)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX> Because such a large
percentage of the costs are fixed, the profitability calculation is
sensitive to both the average revenue per piece and the average
pieces per box. If the postal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> operated at a lower scale,
revenue per piece would need to be higher to maintain the same
revenue cost balance. It is not clear, without further analysis,
what would happen to profitability if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> operated at a
lower scale<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX>
The average revenue per piece for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> is
used to estimate the average revenue per box. We have no
independent estimate of the average revenue for mail delivered by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>. If mail delivered by rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> has a different
composition compared to the system as a whole, profitability
conclusions would vary. In that case, the nondelivery attributable
costs would vary in the same direction as revenue, but not by
enough to offset the revenue change.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX> provides both the input and output for the profitability
calculations for all rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>. It can be seen that by
serving all rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> and using actual labor costs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
Service realized an average profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.8 cents</NUMEX> per box per day,
or a total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> profit for all rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$669 million</NUMEX>. To
put this figure in perspective, the total accrued expenditures for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$39 billion</NUMEX>.32
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX> shows that, using the average labor cost for all
bargaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, the profit drops to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$283 million</NUMEX>. The profit
from serving all rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> is obviously highly sensitive to the
labor cost of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>. However, using either labor cost
figure, rural delivery was profitable for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>.
If, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s overall surplus had been much
larger, the profit from rural delivery would no doubt have been
greater. Conversely, if <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> had been one in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>
had a sizeable deficit, rural delivery would have been less
profitable. Fortunately for purposes of this analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>
essentially broke even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> and so the profit from
30
In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Docket R90-1</ENAMEX>, the variability or elasticity of evaluated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> route costs with respect to volume was estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
percent by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>.
31
It does seem clear that the ratio of mail delivered to rural
boxes to mail delivered to city addresses is an important factor in
determining profitability.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> surplus for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> was under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> delivery need not be interpreted based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>'s overall financial results.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX> displays the profitability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> quintiles of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> routes (based on population density) using both actual
compensation and average bargaining compensation. It can be seen
that the profit per box differs substantially from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> (or
least densely populated) quintile of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> (or
most densely populated) quintile. Using actual labor cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only</NUMEX>, the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> quintile was unprofitable, while, using average bargaining
labor cost, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quintiles</ENAMEX> were unprofitable.
Because the most densely populated quintiles of routes serve
more boxes, their total profit is disproportionate to their per-
box profit. Using either labor cost, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
quintiles were profitable.

Given the assumptions discussed above, rural delivery is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">remunerative</ENAMEX> and it is unlikely that it would be abandoned if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> service requirement were eliminated. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>,
however, might expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> to either drop or reduce
the level of service to the boxes in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> quintiles
of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> quintile comprises <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 2.5 percent</NUMEX> of
all addresses served by rural and city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> combined. The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> serves <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 percent</NUMEX>.



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concluding Remarks</ENAMEX> and Summary

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX>. Concluding Remarks
While the boxes served by the quintile of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> serving the
least densely populated areas are unprofitable, we believe that it
is unlikely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> would discontinue service to
them (or try to decrease their level of service) if the universal
service requirement were eliminated.
-The total loss on those boxes is small relative to total costs
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>.
-Because these routes are scattered all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, boxes
on these routes are not easily identifiable without consulting an
extensive list. Consequently, it would be costly for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> to
separate mail addressed to these boxes from their remaining
mail.
-The transaction costs involved in putting pieces addressed to
boxes in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> quintile of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> in the hands of another
delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, which would serve these addresses, would also be
high.
-If these addresses were dropped from the delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, it
would likely reduce the volume of mail sent by these addresses to
the remaining portions of the delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Thus, profitable
volume would be lost.
Perhaps the above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> points are simply underlying reasons for
the truism that for common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> serving the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>,
larger service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> (be they mail, package, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>, or
telephone) are more valuable to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> than
smaller service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. It is no accident that, within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Parcel Service</ENAMEX> provides ubiquitous service for
parcels<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> and other overnight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> do the same
for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> delivery. Moreover, the major long distance telephone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> also provide ubiquitous service. Quite possibly, all of
these common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> find that sparsely settled portions of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are unprofitable to serve. That these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> provide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">universal</ENAMEX> service suggests that rural areas would receive postal
service even absent a universal service requirement.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.2</NUMEX>. Summary
-In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> postal system, there is no real difference
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> time required to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and rural addresses.
-The average <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> delivery cost reflects the higher cost of
serving businesses compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX>.
-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural</ENAMEX> delivery cost reflects a lower level of service than city
delivery.
33
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> does not provide parcel service at the ordinary rate to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> bush where there are no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and service must be provided
by air.
-Because fewer pieces are delivered per box on rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> than
per possible delivery on city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>, the per piece delivery cost
is higher for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> than for city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>.
-The cost of delivery per box for the least densely populated
quintile of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> is much higher than the average for all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> routes.
-The revenue from mail delivered to rural areas as a whole
exceeds the cost of handling and delivering that mail.
-There is a loss on serving the least densely populated quintile
of rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>.
-It is likely that if the universal service requirement were
eliminated, even the most sparsely populated rural areas would
receive service.

delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hoursa</ENAMEX> come from payroll <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> accounting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> data made available in the most recent rate proceeding.
These work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> are apportioned among city delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> route
types on the basis of cost allocations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">In-Office Cost</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System</ENAMEX>,b an ongoing work sampling system that is used to allocate
costs for certain labor crafts among different activities and rate
categories for ratemaking purposes.
Information concerning the total number of possible deliveries
is taken from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">City Delivery National Totals Report</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrier Cost System</ENAMEX> (CCS) data are used to allocate total possible
deliveries among different route types and to determine the average
pieces per possible delivery for different delivery and route types
on letter routes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCS</ENAMEX> is used in rate cases to determine
attributable costs and associated distribution keys for certain
city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCS</ENAMEX> data are collected throughout the year
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 500 thousand</NUMEX> sampled stops on city delivery letter
routes.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Delivery Carrier Data</ENAMEX>
Most rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> are evaluated routes. Evaluated routes are
those routes for which the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>'s annual salary is
calculated using a set of standard time allowances. Time standards
are applied to workload <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (e.g., mileage, delivery boxes,
quantity of mail by shape, etc.) to calculate the total evaluated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> required to serve a rural route, and thus the salary of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> serving that route.
To measure the workload elements needed to calculate the
evaluated time, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Mail</ENAMEX> Count for most rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> is
conducted periodically in accordance with the labor agreement
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Postal Service</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>. The statistics on rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> presented in this paper
are based on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Mail Count</ENAMEX> data.c

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> used a sample of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Mail</ENAMEX> Count
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> to measure the elasticity (variability) of rural carrier costs

from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 5 to October 2, 1989</TIMEX>, and included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,775</NUMEX> rural
routes out of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46,197</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> for a few of the counted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> routes appeared to be internally inconsistent. Counted routes
that had one or more of the following properties were deleted:d
