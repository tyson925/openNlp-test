<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. SUMMARY</ENAMEX>
This report provides an analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Postal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>'s current legal authority to: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) introduce and provide new
products and services; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) enter into negotiated service
agreements with individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. This report also includes
background on the use of such authority within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s analysis of existing postal law yields the
following conclusions:


‚Ä¢
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Postal Reorganization Act of 1970</ENAMEX> gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States Postal Service</ENAMEX> a clear mandate to innovate by developing
effective and efficient services adapted to the needs of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>'s mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.


‚Ä¢
The mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic
mail services is the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> shared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> to adopt new mail classifications
under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. ¬ß¬</ENAMEX>ß <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3623 through 3625</TIMEX>.


‚Ä¢
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> has developed specialized
procedural rules that provide for expeditious consideration of
proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due
process rights of other interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>.


‚Ä¢
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negotiated Service Agreements</ENAMEX> (NSAs) or "niche
classifications" are rate and service adjustments arranged by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> that are legally permissible,
provided that:


‚ù∂ The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding, as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reorganization Act</ENAMEX> requires;
‚ù∑ The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the
mutual benefit of mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and the postal system as a whole;
and
‚ù∏ The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on
the same terms to other potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> willing to meet the same
conditions of service.


II. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>
In joint deliberations on appropriations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and certain other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fiscal Year 2002</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> of conference directed both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> to prepare reports on
particular areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s authority under existing
law.1 Specifically, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> directed:
‚Ä¶both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Postal Service</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate</ENAMEX>
Commission to independently report, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> after enactment of this
Act, on the scope of existing authority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Postal Service</ENAMEX>,
under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title 39, United States Code, and title 39, Code</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Regulations, to introduce and provide new products and services
(including the introduction and provision of new products and
service on an experimental or market test basis) and to enter into
negotiated service agreements with individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> or groups
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Such reports shall include background on the use of
such authority within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 24 months</TIMEX> and shall be provided to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Committees</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Committee on</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governmental Affairs</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Committee on Government</ENAMEX>
Reform.

As directed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> submits this report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives Committees on Appropriations</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Governmental Affairs</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Committee on</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Reform</ENAMEX>.
The report is presented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sections. The first outlines
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s current legal authority to introduce new
products and services, the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> in
that process, and the procedural mechanisms available for expedited
approval of such innovations. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> section addresses the same
topics in connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negotiated Service Agreements</ENAMEX> (NSAs),
so-called "niche classifications," which are special service and
rate arrangements negotiated between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and a
particular mailer or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of mailers with features tailored to
their use of the postal system. Finally, an appendix to the report
summarizes recent
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> The amended bill produced by the conference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> was
enacted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pub</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107-67</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">115 Stat</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">514</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>).

NEW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PRODUCTS</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERVICES</ENAMEX>


A. Innovation under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Reorganization Act</ENAMEX>
While pre-existing law afforded limited opportunities for postal
innovation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Postal Reorganization Act of 1970</ENAMEX> gave the
newly-created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Postal Service</ENAMEX> a clear mandate to
innovate by developing effective and efficient services adapted to
the needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>'s mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 101</ENAMEX>(a) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 39</ENAMEX>
establishes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s paramount obligation "to provide
postal services to bind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX> together through the personal,
educational, literary, and business correspondence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>."
The same section establishes the performance criterion that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> is expected to achieve as a matter of postal policy:
"It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> in all areas and . . . all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>." Similarly, ¬ß
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">403</NUMEX>(a) assigns the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> the duty to "plan, develop,
promote, and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fair
and reasonable rates and fees." The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act</ENAMEX> fosters service innovation
by assigning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> responsibility "to provide types of
mail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and
mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>[.]" 39
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> ¬<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ß 403</NUMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reorganization Act</ENAMEX> grants the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> specific powers
that serve as the operational tools of service innovation. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">404</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 39</ENAMEX> grants the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> plenary authority over
custody of the mail and its movement <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">[¬ß 404</NUMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)]; over the
deployment of post <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and equipment [¬ß
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">404</NUMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)]; and over the means by which stamps and other postage
are sold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">[¬ß 404</NUMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)]. The same section also authorizes
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> "to provide, establish, change, or abolish
special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonpostal</ENAMEX> or similar services[.]" <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. ¬</ENAMEX>ß
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">404</NUMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>).
Conclusion: The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Postal Reorganization Act of 1970</ENAMEX> clearly
mandates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> innovate by developing effective
and efficient postal services adapted to the needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nation</ENAMEX>'s
mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.

maintain a research and development program, and to conduct
experiments to enhance the operational efficiency and economy of
the postal system.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domestic Mail</ENAMEX>
Classifications
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Prior to 1970</TIMEX>, the array of mail services provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Department</ENAMEX> was codified as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 39.3 The</ENAMEX>
Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal
services with an administrative process in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governors</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> establish, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX>
reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, which are compiled as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domestic Mail Classification</ENAMEX>
Schedule (or "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">DMCS</ENAMEX>")<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 3621 of Title 39</ENAMEX> provides that "the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governors</ENAMEX> are
authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail .
. . in accordance with the provisions of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3623</TIMEX>(a) directs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> to file a request with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> for a recommended decision on establishing a
mail classification schedule within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> of the Reorganization
Act's effective date. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> complied with this
requirement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in 1973</TIMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domestic Mail Classification</ENAMEX>
Schedule recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> became effective on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 6</TIMEX>,
1976.5
Following establishment of this initial mail classification
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">schedule, ¬ß 3623</ENAMEX>(b) provides that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> "may from time
to time request that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> submit, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> may
submit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governors</ENAMEX> on its own initiative, a recommended
decision on changes in the mail classification schedule."
Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow
proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is
afforded to mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> required to

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States Postal Service</ENAMEX> on Establishing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mail Classification</ENAMEX>
Schedule, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2, 1976</TIMEX>.
Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 25 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> has filed many such
mail classification requests with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>, seeking either to
establish new postal products or to reconfigure pre-existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. Less frequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> has begun proceedings on
its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s
request to do so. Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer
useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>.
Conclusion: The joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> shared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reorganization Act</ENAMEX> to adopt
new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing
innovations in domestic mail service.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. Commission</ENAMEX> Procedures Adapted to the Expeditious
Consideration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proposed Service Innovations</ENAMEX>
Recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations
merit consideration under specialized procedures, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
has adopted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> sets of rules that are customized for defined
categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> requests. The rules depart from those
generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by
reducing the amount of supporting evidence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> is
required to produce, and by expediting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s procedural
schedule for considering the particular form of proposed
change.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> determined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost twenty years ago</TIMEX> that there was
a need for specialized rules to facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> mail
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">classification</ENAMEX> requests involving proposed new services, or changes
in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments.
The rules, contained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.F.R. ¬</ENAMEX>ß¬<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ß 3001.67</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">.67d</TIMEX>, provide
a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trial-type hearing
is required; allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> to explain the unavailability
of data that would otherwise have to be filed; and provide for data
collection for the duration of the experiment. The experimental
rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 days</TIMEX> from the
Commission's determination that the proposed change is experimental
in nature.
These rules were not used extensively. A joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service-Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> task force suggested a number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> where additional special rules might further encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
Service innovation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> petitioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> to adopt rules to implement some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX>'s
recommendations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> conducted a rulemaking to consider
the rules proposed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>'s petition, and after considering
the comments of interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, implemented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the
proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures
for particular categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> requests. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
set specifies conditions under which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> may use multi-year
test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become
compensatory over time.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s rules of practice as sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">161</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">166,7</NUMEX>
establish expedited procedures for consideration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>
proposed market tests of potential new services. The rules specify
the limited information the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> is required to file in support
of a proposed market test, including a plan for testing the
proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting
requirements. They also streamline public notice and hearing
procedures, and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission
decision on the proposed market test within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>, consistent
with the procedural due process rights of interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s innovative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mailing Online</ENAMEX> service, for which a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> experimental trial was requested and approved in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Docket</ENAMEX>
No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MC2000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, was initially considered and recommended by the
Commission under the market test rules. See the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX> to this
report under the heading for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Docket</ENAMEX> No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MC2000</NUMEX>-2.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of rules<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,8</NUMEX> apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> proposals to
implement new services that would supplement, but not alter,
existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for
a limited time. As in the market test rules, the provisional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">service</ENAMEX> rules identify the supporting information to be provided by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>; in addition, they allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> to explain
why it should not be required to provide
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the</ENAMEX>

information called for in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s general rules for
mail classification proposals. The rules likewise expedite public
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> and procedural scheduling, providing for a "yes or no"
Commission decision within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>, consistent with the due process
rights of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>.
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> set of rules, adopted as sections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69 through 69c</TIMEX> of the
rules of practice<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,9</NUMEX> applies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> requests for
permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Minor</ENAMEX>" classification changes are defined as those that would not
change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new
restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly
increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected
mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>. The rules specify limited required supporting
information, allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> to explain the unavailability of
otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling.
Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the
procedural deadline for rendering a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> decision is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>
from the filing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> request if no hearings are
held, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">120 days</TIMEX> if hearings are scheduled in the case.
Finally, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> set of rules, contained in sections <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">181</NUMEX> and
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182</NUMEX> of the rules of practice, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> applies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> requests
for new services that it believes cannot recover all their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> costs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first full fiscal year</TIMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>.
In such instances, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>'s request must be supported by
testimony of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> that explains the rationale
for the proposed multi-year test period. The request should also
provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new
service for the entire proposed test period. The rules establish a

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS</ENAMEX>
TO PROVIDE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERVICES</ENAMEX>
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a number of years</TIMEX>, some mailers have pursued the idea of
establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service
through negotiation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>. Depending on their
respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of
this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service
agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications." In
addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current
law, it is important to identify and consider all of their
characteristics. For example, the legality of an agreement may be
dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed
without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form
of review by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> prior to its
effectiveness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority</ENAMEX>
No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> from entering into rate or service agreements
with mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 401</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 39</ENAMEX> generally empowers the
Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no
prohibition elsewhere against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and mail users
negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of
service should be changed. However, other provisions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 39</ENAMEX>
cast into doubt the conclusion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>'s authority under ¬ß
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">401</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail
classifications by agreement alone.
The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and
substantive. From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of
rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful
because the only means of making such changes recognized in the
Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 36</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 39</ENAMEX>. These provisions require that rate or mail classification
changes desired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> must be filed as a request
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX>, allowing for public scrutiny and
deliberations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
Service.
Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 36</ENAMEX>
has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the
intended change<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX>
Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the
substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reorganization Act</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 403</ENAMEX>(c) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title 39</ENAMEX> directs
that:
In providing services and in establishing classifications,
rates, and fees under this title, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> shall not,
except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or
unreasonable discrimination among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of the mails, nor shall it
grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>.
Sections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3622 and 3623</TIMEX> similarly specify fairness and equity,
together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in
making rate and mail classification changes. Without public
scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service
agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>, there could be
no assurance that these substantive criteria would be
satisfied.
However, assuming the procedural requirements of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 36</ENAMEX> are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">met</ENAMEX>, changes negotiated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and a mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> for
their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable
statutory standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 3623</ENAMEX>(c) directs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> to
consider "the desirability and justification for special
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classifications</ENAMEX> and services of mail" [¬ß <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3623</TIMEX>(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)] and "the
desirability of special classifications from the point of view of
both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>" [¬ß <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3623</TIMEX>(c)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)]. Regarding
rates, ¬ß <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3622</TIMEX>(b)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail
for delivery into the postal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> performed by the mailer and its
effect upon reducing costs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>" as a factor to be
considered in connection with a proposed change. In combination
with other factors and the policies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reorganization Act</ENAMEX>,

considerations could support recommendation of rate and
classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of
particular mailers.
Conclusion: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rate</ENAMEX> and service agreements negotiated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
Service and mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are permissible under current law if the
procedural and substantive requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
Reorganization Act are satisfied.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. Problematical</ENAMEX> "Contract Rates"
In a rulemaking proceeding conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> at the
request of a mailer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> addressed the question of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s authority to negotiate rate changes in the form of
a proposal to recognize "contract rates." After considering
comments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, the
Commission found the proposal problematical, and declined to pursue
it.
The initial proposal, considered in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Docket No. RM89-5</ENAMEX>, included
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> variants:


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> might, after considering cost and other
relevant evidence, establish a range of permissible rates for
particular subclasses, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and individual
mailers free thereafter to negotiate rates within this range;
or


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and one or more mailers would
negotiate a rate and service package which would then (i) be
submitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> for a review, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) thereafter be
available on the same terms to all potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>.


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> solicited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of comments on the proposal
from interested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other mailer took
the position that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> is authorized to enter into
such contracts, provided the procedural requirement of review under
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 36</ENAMEX> is observed. Other commenters-including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Advocate</ENAMEX>-expressed doubts regarding the legal
soundness of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both of the proposed variants of such
agreements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> commented that, in its view, legal
constraints would not preclude a contract mechanism in principle,
but that no such arrangement would be permissible without the
Commission's participation in accordance with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. ¬ß¬</ENAMEX>ß <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3622</TIMEX>
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3625</TIMEX>.
Upon consideration of the initial comments it received, the
Commission declined to pursue the contract rate proposal, but
solicited further comments on several broad issues concerning
possible changes in the mail classification system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
explained that its reluctance to pursue the concept of contract
rates was based on substantial uncertainty regarding the legal
sufficiency of examining agreed-upon rates after the fact, rather
than in a prior review. It also raised the potential problems of
unreasonable discrimination that such contracts might cause, in
contravention of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.C.</ENAMEX> ¬<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ß 403</NUMEX>(c), and the preservation of fair contributions to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s institutional costs by mail volumes<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> Such
problems might well arise if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> were to negotiate
"discounted" rates-unaccompanied by a change in service conditions
that provided cost or revenue justification.
Conclusion: Negotiated rates-unaccompanied by a change in
service conditions that provides cost justification-are a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">problematical</ENAMEX> approach to introducing additional flexibility into
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> business practices.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. Negotiated Service Agreements</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Niche</ENAMEX>
Classifications"
Following publication of the report of the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service-Postal Rate Commission</ENAMEX> task force on ratemaking, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal</ENAMEX>
Service petitioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> to adopt rules to implement some
of the report's recommendations. One recommendation included in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>'s petition was adoption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> rules for reviewing
on an expedited basis "service agreements with postal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>,
varying from the general rate and classifications schedules in ways
which add value both for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and for the postal system as
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX>."14
The proposal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s petition would have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">established Negotiated Service Agreements</ENAMEX> as a new form of mail
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>, with individual agreements to be reviewed by the
Commission within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> of Proposed
Rulemaking, it deferred consideration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> proposal, citing
legal uncertainty regarding the consistency of negotiated rates
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reorganization Act</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">13 Docket No. RM89-5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Further Invitation for Comments</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.

ratemaking provisions. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> also expressed a
general willingness to address the concept in a subsequent
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rulemaking</ENAMEX>.
Since then, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> has conducted several mail
classification proceedings under the other expedited procedures
adopted in that rulemaking. These procedures have been shown to be
well suited to the consideration of "niche classification"
proposals. Niche classifications are specialized mail
classifications- including reduced, but cost-justified rates or
fees-that have been developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> in direct
consultation with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, to meet the needs and capabilities
of a mailer or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of mailers. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
approved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-year</TIMEX> experiment of a program that enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of
bulk, nonletter-size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Reply Mail</ENAMEX> such as photofinishers
that could reliably determine postage and fees due, to obtain
earlier access to their mail at revised fees<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Commission</ENAMEX>
subsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,16</NUMEX> and
ultimately approved a request to make the experimental program a
permanent mail classification<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17 More</NUMEX> recently, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Docket</ENAMEX> No.
MC2001-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> recommended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new worksharing-based
discounted Priority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mail</ENAMEX> categories after negotiating with mailers
who were willing to presort their mail in new ways that could
reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s costs<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.18</NUMEX> Such "niche classification"
proposals are essentially <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Negotiated Service Agreements</ENAMEX>, without
any associated legal uncertainties or additional administrative
barriers.
Conclusion: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rate</ENAMEX> and service adjustments agreed upon by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> and mailers are legally authorized if three
conditions are satisfied:
‚ù∂ The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding, as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Reorganization Act</ENAMEX> requires;
‚ù∑ The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the
mutual benefit of mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> and the postal system as a whole;
