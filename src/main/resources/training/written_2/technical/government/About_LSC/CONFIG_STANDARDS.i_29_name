<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATE PLANNING CONFIGURATION STANDARDS</ENAMEX>
Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force Report - Board</ENAMEX> Approved

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. PREFACE</ENAMEX>
This document-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corporation State Planning</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Configuration Standards</ENAMEX> -- presents in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place a comprehensive
compilation of the standards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> and Designated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning Bodies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSPB</ENAMEX>'s)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> should consider and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Corporation</ENAMEX> will use in considering the configuration of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>'s legal services delivery system.2
Determination of the most appropriate configuration of programs
in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is a part of the broader state planning process
and cannot be divorced from consideration of the overall goals of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> delivery system, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s past performance, current
status, and progress towards and plans for achieving those goals.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corporation</ENAMEX> expects its grantees in each state
and territory to work with one another and with a broad spectrum of
other equal justice stakeholders3 to develop comprehensive,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> statewide civil legal services delivery systems which
are responsive to the most compelling needs of eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client communities</ENAMEX>, ensure the highest and most strategic use of
all available resources, maximize the opportunity for clients
throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to receive timely, effective and appropriate
legal services in the present and in the future, and operate
efficiently and effectively<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> A "Designated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Body</ENAMEX>" is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that has been
established and charged with responsibility for coordinating state
legal services delivery planning. Such planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> are
generally composed of an array of civil equal justice delivery
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, including but not limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from the
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar association</ENAMEX>, state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX> funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, staffed legal
services programs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and non-LSC), the pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, client
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and others with an interest and commitment
to effective delivery of civil legal services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> and
vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s policies regarding internal review of configuration
recommendations, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corporation</ENAMEX> Reconfiguration
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review Process</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 21, 2001</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> planning processes, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, will
vary from state to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> does not require the same process
or participation in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> continues to encourage
broad civil equal justice stakeholder participation at the state
level and expects its grantees to do the same.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> For a fuller articulation of these goals, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Program</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Letters 98-1, 98-6, and 2000-7, and Strategic Directions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-2005</TIMEX>,
adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 28, 2000</TIMEX>.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> will continue to utilize a variety of approaches, LSC
views service area configuration as a key structural component of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> set of strategies employed to promote the creation
and sustainability of comprehensive, integrated state civil equal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has and will continue to require its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grantees</ENAMEX> and encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSPB</ENAMEX>'s to critically examine the degree to
which the configuration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees in any given state promotes
these ends.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the configuration that will best serve
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> ultimately involves a
balancing of factors and the application of judgment to a host of
considerations. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is different, and in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intra</ENAMEX>-state regions differ significantly as well. Some standards
relevant to decisions affecting configuration can, in context,
suggest different conclusions, depending upon the state or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">geographic</ENAMEX> region involved. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s configuration must be
viewed on the totality of the circumstances.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> values the judgments of designated state planning bodies
that have addressed the question and will normally give great
weight to those judgments that have been developed through an
inclusive, thoughtful, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>-centered process. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> will only
adopt a different configuration based upon good and substantial
reasons clearly articulated in writing and tied to the specific
standards enumerated herein.
These standards shall guide the state planning process on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconfiguration</ENAMEX> and shall serve as the criteria for decisions of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>. Under these guidelines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> will exercise its statutory
responsibility to insure that grants and contracts are made so as
to provide the most economical and effective delivery of legal
assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in both urban and rural areas.5


II. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Statutory Responsibility</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> operates under a statutory mandate to make funding decisions
that maximize the effective and economical delivery of high quality
legal services to eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout the state within a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, integrated delivery system. This duty can be
effectively carried out through a process that recognizes the
importance of creating enduring capacities at the state level to
support legal services delivery systems.
In some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, it may be possible to develop and implement
statewide initiatives to improve service delivery, increase
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> and enhance the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> Corporation <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act, Section 1007</ENAMEX>(a)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>).
capacity of the system to meet the civil legal needs of
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> without altering service
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> or historical relationships. In other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, the very
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and implementation of such initiatives may require
reconfiguration of organizational relationships and service
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Configuration Standards</ENAMEX>
In making a determination as to whether the configuration of
LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> set out in the state plan will maximize the
effective and economical delivery of high quality legal services to
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout the state within a comprehensive,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> delivery system, both in the present and in the future,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> will review the strategies outlined in the state plan against
