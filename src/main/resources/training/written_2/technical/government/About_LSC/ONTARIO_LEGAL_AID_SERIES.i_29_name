<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRESENTATION OF RANDI YOUELLS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC VICE PRESIDENT FOR PROGRAMS</ENAMEX>
FOR THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ONTARIO LEGAL AID SPEAKER SERIES</ENAMEX>
Thank you for inviting me to your wonderful Country and the
beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> to talk with you about the subject that
has been the primary focus of my professional life over the last
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-seven years</TIMEX>-the provision of high quality legal services to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who could not otherwise afford legal aid. As did many of you
in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, I started my legal aid journey fresh out of law
school in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>. As I was sworn in as a licensed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> in the
state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>-which is a small rural farming state located in the
midwestern part of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>-I optimistically and mistakenly
believed that my "life in legal services" would be a short one. I
truly believed that in my lifetime I would witness the eradication
of poverty and injustice. I believed that I would see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> when
no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-be they <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>-would go hungry at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. I
believed to the very core of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> that the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> was on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brink</ENAMEX> of a new era in which intolerance and bigotry and prejudice
would no longer exist. But as we all know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that young women
who started her life in legal services in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> full of hope and
promise-and just a wee bit na√Øve-was not correct about what the
future would hold.
Today, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corporation of Iowa</ENAMEX>
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> are providing legal assistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> I tried to help <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 years ago</TIMEX>.
Today, in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live in our
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Today, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> go to bed hungry at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
Today, just like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 years ago</TIMEX>, racial and ethnic bigotry remains
the central reality of most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>' lives. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>-just like
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> knock on the door of legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> and they are told, "no one is home. And that is the
reality that brings us here on this beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September day</TIMEX>.
Because we are older and wiser-and perhaps more damaged and more
battle-scarred-we know that the promise of legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> has not
been fulfilled. But perhaps because within all of us there
continues to live younger more idealistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>-a whisper of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> we were at the beginning of our professional lives-we are
here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> because we are not ready to let go of the "promise" of
legal services. We are not ready to call it quits. We are not ready
to stop believing that we can build a world-class legal services
delivery system in both of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
That's what I will speak to you about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Although most of my
remarks will be devoted to the steps we have undertook within my
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to revitalize a struggling legal services delivery
system-steps that we often colloquially refer to as state
planning-state planning has always been for me but a tool. The
overarching goal has always been-and will always be-the creation of
world class legal services delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> in which no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> or
potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> is turned away. After all, in a democracy, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">halls</ENAMEX> of justice must always stand wide open and everyone must be
welcome to walk through them unimpeded and unchallenged.
Let's start with a history lesson. Legal services programs in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> began in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>'s as special model projects
initiated by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Economic</ENAMEX>
Opportunity. They were infused with the idealism and spirit of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and strengthened by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>'s vision of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Society</ENAMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, who signed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act of 1974</ENAMEX>, they became an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> and, over time, a familiar
part of the legal landscape in every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> state and territory.
Until very, very recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> were organized and
operated pretty much as they had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a quarter of a century ago</TIMEX>. They
were locally focused and passionately promoted "local control."
Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> made legal services their careers. Some of the
programs' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> stayed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> program for their entire
professional lifetimes. In some programs, board membership
terminated only with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>'s death. The kinds of cases
handled, the strategies for addressing the legal needs of service
area <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client community</ENAMEX> itself remained pretty
much the same in most LSC programs until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990</TIMEX>'s. And, while the
idealism and vision of a new world remained part of our mantra, its
place of honor receded, as legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> became business as usual
for many grantees.
Several events in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990</TIMEX>'s brought an end to this way of
life for the legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,
which controls our funding levels, began to include many members
who did not support the purpose and goals of a federal civil legal
services program. Consequently, funding appropriations diminished
or failed to keep up with the cost of living. Then, in the middle
of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX>, a vigorous effort to do away with legal services
resulted in a funding bill that carried significant restrictions,
including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that prohibited programs from seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>'s
fees. Additional restrictions prevented our grantees from doing
much of the work they had previously handled-representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>
in civil litigation, representing certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>,
representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in class action lawsuits. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> also
told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> that it could not continue to fund its grantees
"presumptively" and that it must begin to distribute its funds on a
competitive basis. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of significant funding declines,
restrictions and competition began to inexorably change the way
that legal services in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> operate.
As a funder and as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> concerned with seeing that
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who struggle with critical civil legal
emergencies such as evictions and domestic violence, have access to
the justice system, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> was not willing to accept the "guide path
to oblivion" that some had designed for our future. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, LSC
began to initiate a series of efforts that we believed would ensure
that services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> did not falter in a time of decreasing
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> and limited opportunities. Needless to say, most of 'the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>,' as we refer to the collective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> that constitutes our
grantee programs, was already frightened and concerned because of
the funding drops, new restrictions and competition fears. When, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> announced its intent to launch an initiative that would
require massive restructuring of the national legal services
delivery system, the announcement was also quite frightening and
was not greeted, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many quarters</TIMEX>, with open arms.
So, what has LSC done to restructure the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> legal services
delivery system since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>? The most innovative and certainly the
most difficult part of our strategy to move our grantees into new
approaches to serving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>-and the one that has received the
most attention (both good and bad)-is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning</ENAMEX> strategy
that we launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. As it was conceived and as it has played
out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Initiative</ENAMEX> is a
new visioni for legal services in which eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in
every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are afforded an equal opportunity to avail themselves
and ultimately to attain high-quality civil legal assistance. In an
effort to foster more consistent levels of statewide service and to
eliminate "service gaps" that leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in geographically
remote areas underrepresented compared to their urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has asked each of its grantees to undergo a fundamental
paradigm shift in their program vision. Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have been
instructed to abandon the parochial thinking of "What's best for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in my service area?" and asked instead to consider "What's
best for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>?" and ultimately, "What's best
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>".
I think that it is important for you to know that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> initially
stressed the importance of state planning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> when it asked its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to participate in the development of a
plan for the design, configuration, and operation of LSC-funded
programs in their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lettersii</ENAMEX> were primarily
developed it response to funding cuts and restrictions that had
crippled legal services in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. These early planning
documents laid the foundation for what was to come in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> in that
they began to set forth a vision for legal services delivery and
enumerated the issues and criteria that state planning should
address. However, except for a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> calls
for state planning were largely ignored and to be honest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> did
little during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX> period to promote nationwide strategic
planning.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Initiative</ENAMEX> was re-initiated. LSC
Program Letters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-1iii and 1998-6iv</TIMEX> directed programs to plan
for the creation of comprehensive, integrated, coordinated legal
services systems and defined the terms of such systems. Grantees
were required to submit a report outlining their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> plans by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 1998</TIMEX>. Their plans were to include responses to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
initial central tenets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning</ENAMEX>:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) development of intake, advice, and referral services; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
effective usage of technology; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) increased access to legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-help</ENAMEX> and prevention information; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) coordination of legal
work, training, information, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> assistance; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) engagement
of pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) development of additional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, local,
and private resources; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) optimal configuration of service
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> did not confine its "directives" to what a plan should
include. It also laid out the parameters of the planning process
itself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LSC</ENAMEX> instructed its grantee programs to collaborate with a
range of local, state, and national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, including state
and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar associations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interest On Lawyers Trust</ENAMEX> Account
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>, state judiciaries, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client groups</ENAMEX>, pro bono
commissions, state legislatures, non-LSC-funded legal services
programs, and a host of others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> required its grantees in each
state to work with each other and with other equal justice
stakeholders to develop justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> that best respond to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>' most compelling needs, ensure the most strategic and
cost-effective use of all available resources, and maximize the
opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> statewide to receive timely, effective, and
appropriate legal services.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, guided by the belief that access to quality legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> is critical to a fair adversarial justice system and
committed to making significant improvements in the delivery system
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Board of Directorsv</ENAMEX> approved and enacted its own strategic
plan-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Directions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-2005</TIMEX>-which was adopted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. The twin objectives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Directions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-2005</TIMEX> were to
dramatically increase the number of low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> who can
access the civil justice system and to ensure that all clients
receive quality legal services. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Directions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-2005</TIMEX> was
developed as a forward-looking document. It reinforced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning Initiative</ENAMEX> already in place by calling state planning its
"most important strategy".
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s goal-a goal shared by many of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> equal justice movement like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Legal Aid and Defender Association</ENAMEX>-was to obtain a
critical mass of new ideas, funds and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> into the national
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, and to assist <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> who
were being denied access to civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> because funding was
diminished, because programs were failing to keep up with
technological and other innovations, and because many of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grantees</ENAMEX> worked in isolation within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and across state lines.
This was a tremendous change for our grantees and for the delivery
system that we funded. However, the state planning initiative was
also a big change (as some would say, a huge paradigm shift) for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> LSC had defined itself by the
very traditional roles of funder and regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. The state
planning initiative required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> to become something different,
transforming itself into an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of change and an equity partner
capable of effecting large-scale reformation in a moribund delivery
system. And, as any one versed in organizational psychology or even
experienced in managing a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> knows, such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transformations</ENAMEX> do not come easy, they are seldom painless, and
they require the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> leading such a
transformation to put themselves on the line in ways that often are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unfamiliar</ENAMEX> and unpleasant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> was no exception and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, within
the walls of LSC you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who still do not
understand or support the state planning initiative. Indeed, in
recent internal budget battles within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, projects essential to
the creation of world class delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>- such as the
development of a new measurement system to measure our work and the
work of our grantees in terms of outcomes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and projects
to ensure that the delivery system is inclusive and
multi-culturally competent-were summarily removed from the first
drafts of the budget by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who prepare the budget. Funding
for these projects was ultimately restored, but not without the
intervention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX>. And
even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>-including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> that work for me-at times
mention that they do not support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s state planning initiative
and believe that our state planning work is beyond our central
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX>. Fortunately, many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> do not see it in the same
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>.
The creation of a world-class delivery system involved more than
"state planning", per se. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> also launched companion
initiatives-the quality initiative, the diversity initiative,
technology initiative grants, to name <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a few</NUMEX> -that worked
hand-in-glove with state planning to promote the development of
high-quality delivery systems. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most important companion
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> was and continues to be competition. At the same time that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> was launching its state planning initiative, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> required
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> to cease funding its grantees "presumptively" and to begin to
fund programs on a competitive basis. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has been providing
funding on a competitive basis for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX>. In reality, there
has been very little actual "competition" for our federal funds.
There are many reasons for this lack of "real competition." First
and probably foremost, as we all know, providing high-quality legal
services to low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> is not as easy as it looks. It
requires systems and practices and mindsets and commitments that
may be foreign to many other non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> of human
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has placed numerous
restrictions on legal services funding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>-restrictions that then attach to non-LSC funds-causes many
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> that might otherwise seriously consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">applying for</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funds to choose not to do so. However, the fact that the
competition process has not resulted in widespread "competition"
for funding does not mean that it has not been successful. Indeed,
I feel that the competition process has been successful in ways
that I would not have ever envisioned when I was hanging out in
legal services programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> in the seventies,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eighties</ENAMEX> and nineties. Why? Because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in setting up a
system of competition was to develop standards and benchmarks that
we would use to evaluate programs and assess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>'
eligibility. And this was an important-and perhaps in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
legal services-quite revolutionary development. The fact that
benchmarks exist means that there is a standard that all grantees
must meet before they are funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>. It means that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has a
regular means of gathering important qualitative and quantitative
information on all our grantees against which we can evaluate their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> and their improvement. But it also means that there are
aspirational goals for "perfection" that define a high-quality
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX>. We have found that many of our grantees
work hard to attain those aspirational goals. Competition was
designed to improve quality. And I think that will be its lasting
legacy; the fact that is has improved quality over the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and it will continue to do so. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX> the legal services
delivery system in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> gets better at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of
competition as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> refines and improves the process and as our
grantees, individually and collectively, become the kinds of
high-quality legal services programs of which we can all be
proud.
Competition, in and of itself, is now a major tool used by LSC
to develop a worldclass delivery system. We use it to push our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grantees</ENAMEX> toward stronger and more aggressive delivery of services
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. It allows us to create more forceful means of
conditioning our grants. It allows us to measure program
performance in more sophisticated ways. But linking competition to
state planning has expanded the impact of both of these initiatives
in powerful ways that we were not able to envision in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. Let me
explain.
When an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicant</ENAMEX> seeks federal funding from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and as they
become grantees, they are required, as a condition of continued
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX> funding, to pursue state planning with all other LSC-funded
grantees, The penultimate goals is the establishment of
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of justice" in every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The core elements of the
planning/competition link are as follows:


‚Ä¢
Grantees must commit to not only providing quality legal
services within their service area but also to working with other
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to develop a comprehensive, coordinated,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> delivery system;


‚Ä¢
Grantees must commit to join with other equal justice
stakeholders to establish statewide delivery systems
capable-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">aspirationally</NUMEX>-of serving every eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
despite geographic, cultural and physical barriers that
exist;


‚Ä¢
Grantees must commit to utilizing new technologies,
self-help materials, new intake systems and multi-cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to
reach underserved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>;


‚Ä¢
Grantees must prove to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> that their service area
boundaries are as relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> as when
they were first "drawn" or they must work together and with us to
redraw them;


‚Ä¢
Grantees must work collaboratively with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and
organizations they may have historically considered to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> for scarce funds (such as other nonprofit human and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and non-LSC funded legal services
programs) or unlikely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>, bar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>);


‚Ä¢
Grantees must leverage additional resources to expand
services to lowincome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>; and


‚Ä¢
Here's the kicker-grantees must do all of this or risk
the loss of their federal funding.


As I noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the state planning initiative was a huge
shift in thinking for the legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. But initially,
most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> thought that like many other projects begun by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>,
they only had to wait it out and it too would disappear into the
ozone or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethernet</ENAMEX> or wherever legal services ideas go to find their
eternal rest. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> quickly began to prove we were serious about
planning. We highlighted model systems in our literature and
program visits. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Board</ENAMEX> meetings, local events and national
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conferences</ENAMEX>, we showcased exemplary planning and implementation. We
developed technical assistance funds for creative planning projects
and obtained a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15.6 million</NUMEX> commitment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to underwrite
sophisticated hardware, Web-based and telephonic systems to expand
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Internally</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> worked aggressively to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibrate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Programs Division</ENAMEX> so that every
programmatic effort advanced the creation of high-quality delivery
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. For example, grant-award decisions and visits to assess
program quality also focused on the efficacy of statewide systems
and collaborative efforts with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> serving the client
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. As a result, over time, and with much gnashing of teeth
the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> did begin to dance" and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, its grantees and the
federally-funded legal services delivery system began to evolve
from a piecemeal, Great Society experiment to carefully chosen
nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> working together to serve poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in
every jurisdiction.
The most enduring legacy of the state planning initiative-at
least in terms of its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>-has probably has been its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> in fostering cooperation among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> had designated state planning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> dedicated to
strengthening legal services. Today, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>;
most others are in the midst of creating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. An essential function
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> is establishing public-private coalitions to
maximize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX>' ability to leverage their federal investment.
For example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, the engagement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> and private bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> helped spawn appropriations for
legal services in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$68.5 million</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost three</NUMEX>
times more than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> appropriated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. Meanwhile, private bar
campaigns quadrupled their fundraising from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.3 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$23.6 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years ago</TIMEX> when I was a legal services
program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>, the private bar was either our adversary
or a somewhat disfavored <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of legal services.
Just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with unsavory family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, legal services
programs tolerated the presence of private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in our pro bono
models of delivery because we had to-not because we thought they
were doing anything useful. Today, in most parts of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> between legal services programs and the private
bar are deep and true. Private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have an enhanced
understanding of the importance of our work. We, in turn,
understand the vital role they play in helping to assure that no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> goes unserved. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years ago</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> was someone you saw
behind the bench when you went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> from all
levels, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justices</ENAMEX> of state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Courts</ENAMEX>, speak out
about the need for quality legal services for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and
work with us to try to respond to the problems that are being
presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> justice system as a whole as the
number of self-represented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> grows exponentially.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning</ENAMEX> also has improved access for the fastest-growing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client subgroup</ENAMEX>: non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has partnered with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX>
Project <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directors Association</ENAMEX> to promote inclusion and
multi-cultural competency. Today, legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> are
increasingly bilingual; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>-funded
programs in my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> speak <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> language. In addition,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-help</ENAMEX>, multilingual computer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX> have overcome language
barriers to help <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> living on reservations - and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> - enforce their
legal rights without knowing a word of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
And I personally believe that the quality and effectiveness of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">advocacy</ENAMEX> also has improved over the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>. The "prime
directives" of state planning emphasize quality, training, holistic
legal services and cross-program advocacy, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and its grantees
have paid increasing attention to the quality of the services we
provide to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.
How does this relate to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and, specifically, the initiative
you propose to launch to address issues that trouble your legal
services system? Legal services programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> are about the
same age as ours, and serve a similar client <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. You face,
just like us, certain problems:


‚Ä¢
Insufficient funding;


‚Ä¢
Outmoded delivery system;


‚Ä¢
Changes in client <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>;


‚Ä¢
Changes in the law;


‚Ä¢
Technological changes; and


‚Ä¢
The need to prepare for the future.


These are pretty serious problems. At times, they even appear
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insurmountable</ENAMEX>. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to
address them in a proactive and "straight-on" manner. So I am going
to conclude my remarks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by offering you some guidance as you
give thought to launching your own planning initiative. Consider
them my personal lessons from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> in the planning
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">trenches:</ENAMEX>
First, although our state planning initiative is highly
replicable for any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> trying to effect rapid change
across a large and entrenched culture of individual programs or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, such change is only possible if you are willing to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inclusive</ENAMEX> and collaborative in setting goals and processes, yet
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> and resolute in their ultimate enforcement.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it is going to require massive change not only among
your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> in the field but within your own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>(s).
Historically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> directives were seen by grantees as antithetical
to their mission, so they resisted change while nonetheless
remaining largely dependent on the waning federal investment. In
order to overcome this obstacle we had to change the way we did
business. We ramped up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s profile by visiting programs and
participating in local meetings and national conferences to relay
our message, hear reactions and improve relationships. And this
same consistent message was repeated over and over again by key LSC
staff wherever they traveled-including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, the other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice-Presidents</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> on the ground who were guiding
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> through the planning process. You will have to be willing to
do the same. You will need-all of you will need-to be highly
visible personally and professionally. And you must recognize and
accept that doing so will take inordinate amounts of your time and
your energy.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, you will-let me repeat that loudly and firmly-you WILL
face resistance. Any effort to change a long-established system
will meet resistance. That is inevitable.
However, the good news is that you can slowly overcome this
resistance over time. But time-and timing-will be crucial. It won't
happen <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> and it won't happen without some setbacks. We
failed when we pushed willing, but unprepared grantees to
opportunities they were not ready to exploit. We also suffered more
than was necessary by not including willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> and other
equal justice stakeholders early on as our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in the process
of effectuating change. We didn't realize how long it was going to
take before we would begin to see some successes. And then we
failed to celebrate those successes as important milestones and
victories. So, expect resistance. Commit to the long haul. And
celebrate your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> successes along the journey.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, tie planning to quality early on and stick with it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning</ENAMEX> is not an end. It is a means to an end and you must
clearly and consistently articulate the "end" that you envision.
Talk quality all of the time. Vigorously promote those legal
services programs that provide high-quality legal assistance
holding them out as programs others should emulate. Establish and
share "best practices." Be willing to stick your neck out and hold
conferences and meetings on quality issues of interest to the legal
services communities. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has hosted
numerous conferences where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> can share ideas, such as
Diversity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Community</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Making Mergers Work</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creating Client-Centered Communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>. Had we had more
money we would have facilitated more conferences. They are an
important mechanism to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> together to find-and
define-common ground
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, put your money where your mouth is. Set aside money
specifically for planning. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has awarded more than
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800,000</NUMEX> in technical assistance funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning</ENAMEX> projects.
And although we could have used lots more, this small sum did allow
us to publicly recognize high-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> and promote planning
models for others to emulate. But money is important for another
reason. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning</ENAMEX> has "costs" and you need to be seen as an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> that understands those costs and is willing to help
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grantees</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> with some of the planning
costs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth-Familiarize</ENAMEX> yourself with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sol Alinksy</ENAMEX>'s Rules for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Radicals</ENAMEX>. Not because you are going to use it. But because Mr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alinksy</ENAMEX> lays out what you can personally expect to happen to you if
you are in the forefront of this initiative. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alinksy</ENAMEX> instructs
his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> to pick an issue, find an adversary and make it
personal. And that may be you- at the wrong end of the personal
attacks. So get psychologically prepared and don't be blind-sided
by the venom. Although your journey is going to be difficult and at
times you will doubt yourselves, the benefits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> are well
worth it and the satisfaction of hearing even the most recalcitrant
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX> say that the new system is better than the one that
went before is deeply rewarding. And remember what your Grandmother
probably said to you a long time ago-what doesn't kill you probably
makes you stronger.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Seventh</NUMEX>-Don't ignore the need to promote the value of planning
internally among all of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most stupid errors
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> made as we kicked off an era of planning was not to take
the time-and expend the energy-to make other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and units
within our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> understand the importance of what we
were doing and their vital role in helping promote and develop
world-class delivery systems. This set up needless competition for
scarce resources and created hurt feelings among some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>.
And, finally-keep your eye on the prize. Remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> decided to go to law school, think about that young excited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> starting his/her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> job, remember the neophyte <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attorney</ENAMEX>
newly admitted to the practice of law who was excited, scared and
enthralled about the future. We all cared deeply about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> when
we started this journey. And we care deeply about it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> or we
wouldn't be here together in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. We will settle for nothing
less than a world-class delivery system. And although we are a
little older and slightly grayer and certainly more jaded, and we
know now that we won't see it happen in our lifetimes, we still
believe-I still believe-that our collective dream of a justice
system that lets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> walk through the doors of justice unimpeded
and unshackled, is a dream that we will achieve. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX>. Together.
Here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. And in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
Thank you again for allowing me to be with you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
i <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> made a pledge to help
ensure that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> have access to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s civil justice
system by enacting legislation that created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 27 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has helped <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> solve important, sometimes life-threatening,
civil legal problems. Despite the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and its many
contributions to access to justice for lowincome <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, its
achievements are overshadowed by the fact that so many in our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> continue to suffer injustice and are unable to gain access
to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for critical legal assistance. Until all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> are afforded that access, this promise of our government
will continue to be unfulfilled. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> is committed to promoting a
new vision of legal services that will achieve the goal of bringing
legal services to those currently denied access to the justice
system.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ii</ENAMEX> Program Letter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-1</TIMEX> directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> to develop
plans to stretch scarce federal dollars in the most effective,
efficient ways possible. The letter also anticipated the passage of
congressional restrictions on the activities of LSC programs,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prompting LSC</ENAMEX> to instruct its programs to forge deeper bonds with
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, including non-LSC funded programs, state and
local bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client groups</ENAMEX>. Program Letter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-4</TIMEX> provided a general outline as
to the issues and criteria that the state planning process should
address. Significant emphasis was placed on the integration of
LSC-funded programs into statewide legal services delivery systems
and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> central tenets of state planning were identified.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX> Program Letter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-1</TIMEX>, published on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 12, 1998</TIMEX>,
called upon all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> to analyze any progress made toward
the development of the legal services model envisioned by state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>. Programs were to evaluate whether all programs were
working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohesively</ENAMEX> to assure that urgent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> needs were being
addressed; whether sufficient capacities for training and
information-sharing existed; whether programs were moving forward
on technology; and whether they were collaborating to increase
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> and develop new initiatives to expand the scope of their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. Grantees were also asked to examine whether the existing
program configuration was conducive to the most effective state
delivery system. Grantees were asked to examine their progress in
each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> principal areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning</ENAMEX> in a manner
that included assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the current
approach, establishing goals to strengthen and expand services to
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, and determining the major steps yet to be taken
and a timetable necessary to achieve those goals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> set a
deadline of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 1998</TIMEX>, for submission of state planning
reports.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv Program Letter 1998-6</ENAMEX>, published on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 6, 1998</TIMEX>, responded
to recipient requests for guidance and additional information on
what was expected in their state planning reports. It included
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Considerations</ENAMEX>" designed to address requests for
additional information regarding statewide goals, capacities, and
approaches <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> should consider in their state planning
processes. Program Letter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-6</TIMEX> stated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning</ENAMEX>
Initiative will provide information to aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> in exercising its
statutory responsibility to "insure that grants and contracts are
made so as to provide the most economical and effective delivery of
legal assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in both urban and rural areas."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v LSC</ENAMEX> is headed by an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX>, appointed by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, and confirmed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. By law, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> is
bipartisan and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> may be of the same
political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.
