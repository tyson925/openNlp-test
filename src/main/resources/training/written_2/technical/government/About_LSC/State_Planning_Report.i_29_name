<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX> are like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> -- slow to change
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Belasco</ENAMEX>

Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last ten years</TIMEX>, many civil legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> began to wonder whether the civil legal services delivery
structure that had been in place for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a quarter of a century</TIMEX> was
positioned to meets its many future challenges. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funding</ENAMEX> was
declining or stagnant, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in leadership positions were
weary after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of fighting for survival, demand for the delivery
of quality legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> was increasing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> were questioning
their work environments and their personal goals, technology was
fundamentally changing the practice of law, and society was growing
increasingly inhospitable to the needs of poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The legal
services delivery system, created in another time and place, didn't
seem to be working in the ways that we--stakeholders, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>--expected it to work. And although we were proud of our
collective past, many of us had serious doubts as to whether the
delivery system that we had created, and that had performed well
for us and for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past twenty years</TIMEX>, was the most
effective and efficient delivery system for the difficult and
challenging times ahead.
Programs and program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> responded to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> in
different ways. Some pursued strategic planning initiatives. Others
engaged in aggressive resource development, pursued alternative
methods of providing legal services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, reconfigured their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, or, in some instances, took their skills and talents
elsewhere. And, unfortunately, too many of us did nothing.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corporation</ENAMEX>
recognized that legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> were going to have to
change the method and manner in which they conducted their business
if they were going to remain viable and responsive to the needs of
low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> wanted to encourage all programs
to pursue some semblance of planning. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, therefore, required its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grantees</ENAMEX> to begin to examine, on a statewide level, how all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grantees</ENAMEX> in a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> would serve in the present, and plan
to serve in the future, the civil legal needs of low-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s state planning initiative was primarily
focused on how grantees would work together to address funding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shortfalls</ENAMEX> and to respond to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-96</TIMEX> restrictions. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, LSC
Program Letters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-1 and 98</NUMEX>-6 broadened the scope of the state
planning initiative, asking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> to determine how they could
expand services and ensure that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> received similar levels
of assistance regardless of their location in the state or other
factors such as language, disability or political popularity.
In essence, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Program Letters asked grantees to expand
their horizons from "what's best for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in my service
area" to "what's best for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>." Programs
were requested to develop plans to coordinate and integrate their
work in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> important areas--enhancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> access and
efficiency in delivering high quality legal assistance; using
technology to expand access and enhance services; promoting client
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">self-help</ENAMEX> and preventive legal education and advice; coordinating
legal work and training; collaborating with the private bar;
expanding resources to support legal services; and designing a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">system</ENAMEX> configuration that enhances client services, reduces
barriers and operates efficiently and effectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s grantees
were asked to:


•
Investigate the strengths and weaknesses of and resources
available to individual programs as well as the overall strengths
and weaknesses of and resources available to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s legal
services "system;"


•
Assess the needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> served by the
programs and the overall "system;"


•
Anticipate changes and trends that will most likely
affect civil legal services programs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coming years</TIMEX>;
and


•
Devise a plan of action, on a statewide basis, to address
the identified needs of low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the present while
ensuring that the civil legal needs of future generations of
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> can be efficiently and effectively
addressed.


A handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> answered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s call to action. They
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consolidated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> to increase efficiency and deploy resources
more effectively; they took advantage of technology advances to
improve intake systems; they expanded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of stakeholders
to increase the support and guidance available to service
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>. Their successes inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and other national
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> to a deeper involvement in state planning and higher
expectations for all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> approved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Direction Plan</ENAMEX>. This document commits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> to
dramatically expand the impact of legal services programs
throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> by improving access to legal services among
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> while enhancing the quality of the services
delivered. The Plan highlights <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Initiative</ENAMEX> as
the primary strategy for achieving these goals. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> issued its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> program letter on state planning. Program
Letter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-7</TIMEX> renewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s challenge to its grantees to actively
engage in assessing their delivery practices and policies and the
allocation of their legal services dollars. Program Letter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-7</TIMEX>
makes clear that the state planning initiative will continue to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s highest priority.
What does LSC mean when it talks about state planning? It has
often been pointed out that the term state planning does not
capture the full scope of the activities that are included in the
process as it is playing out across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Developing a plan
is only the beginning of an ongoing effort that includes
implementation of the plan's initiatives, continuous outreach to
new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, regular assessment of progress toward goals, and
modifications of the plan as circumstances change.
Because these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are all included in the concept of
strategic planning, as it is currently understood in management
practice, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage of the term state planning is that it
emphasizes that what is involved is strategic planning for state
equal justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
Developing structures and processes for building and maintaining
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, integrated, statewide civil legal assistance
delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> may define the process more accurately but it is
certainly a mouthful. Building state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> captures
the concepts of partnership and shared responsibility that are
involved, but may under-emphasize the ultimate goal to which the
building of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is directed--the creation and maintenance
of a system capable of providing equal justice for low-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, actions do speak louder than words. It doesn't
really matter if we talk about state planning or state justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> or worldclass delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> or the creation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, integrated and coordinated legal services delivery
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. It just matters that we do it. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX>, however,
the term state planning should be understood in its broadest sense,
as inclusive of all these concepts and various structures,
processes, and individual initiatives described in the following
sections.
One final thought. Although state planning is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s highest
priority and we have put considerable resources into it over the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last three years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> did not embark upon this journey alone. As we
proceeded with state planning activities, our national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>
also introduced projects targeted to the same goals--the creation
in every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of a "state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX>" collaborating on the
creation and maintenance of a civil legal assistance system fully
responsive to the needs of low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Among these
initiatives we would like to specifically recognize are the joint
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA-NLADA SPAN</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Assistance Network</ENAMEX>) project, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">joint NLADA-CLASP Project</ENAMEX> for the Future of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice</ENAMEX>. On the
state level, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX>--based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funders</ENAMEX> including but not limited to
IOLTA programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>--have also been a key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in state
planning.
This Report describes progress that the legal services community
has made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six years</TIMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> issued its first Program Letter
on the subject. It identifies some lessons gleaned from these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">achievements</ENAMEX>, describes the growth in selected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> toward
building a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX> capable of responding to the full
range of civil legal needs of low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Part II</ENAMEX>), and
identifies some lessons that have emerged from successful or
promising planning processes, as well as the particular structures
and strategies that these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have employed (Part III).
We acknowledge the hard work of building state justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and salute all those who have rolled up their sleeves
to take part in this exciting effort. We believe this report
demonstrates there is a big payoff for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>--which, after all,
is what it is all about.

Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past six years</TIMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have developed a range of
initiatives aimed at expanding access and improving services to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. Their achievements, like the planning processes they have
followed, have varied according to local circumstances, challenges,
and opportunities. As expected, one size truly does not fit all.
However, there have been important similarities in terms of
successes. These include:


•
Obtaining or significantly expanding state funding for
legal services;


•
Establishing systems for coordinating advocacy and
training among programs;


•
Making the court system more responsive and accessible to
low-income and pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX>;


•
Reconfiguring programs within a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to strengthen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordination</ENAMEX>, access, and services;


•
Establishing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> to more creatively involve the
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> in the delivery of civil legal assistance;


•
Creating and executing a statewide technology plan to
improve access and enhance delivery;


•
Developing a statewide coordinated intake system;
and


•
Expanding the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> within a state
committed to the concept of equal justice.


This <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> describes the progress that has taken place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>
selected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> toward building state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> capable
of responding to the civil legal needs of their low-income
residents. These <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are at different stages in the planning
process. In a few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, a fully developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> justice community
is in place and its accomplishments are paying off in terms of
expanded and improved services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have
developed key justice community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> whose significant
improvements in the structure of civil legal assistance in their
state position them to make real changes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. Some states
are still in an early phase: they have developed a plan that shows
real promise and are just beginning to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and
launch the initiatives to implement it.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> described here are by no means the only ones that
have made progress. Others could have been included as well. Some
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, made major
changes in their delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995 and 1996</TIMEX> and are working
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diligently</ENAMEX> to realize the full potential of those systems. Others,
such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, are engaged in
promising efforts to overcome particular challenges associated with
their size and diversity. Still others--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX>--while relatively slow to embrace the concept of state
planning have, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>, made significant progress in
addressing issues of access and quality in their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
What we hope to demonstrate in describing what has been achieved
in these selected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is both their differences and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">similarities</ENAMEX>, the range of different processes, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, and
strategies that have led to their successes, and the basic
commonalties that underlie them in terms of vision, inclusiveness,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and commitment. Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> described in this
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> provides insights and lessons that can be of benefit to
others.


In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in recognition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s size,
diversity and complexity asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> to allow it to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> develop
regional plans for the creation of "regional" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> approved this proposal and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> received regional plans
from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> regions. The current configuration and planning successes
in each of these regions are described below:
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Region</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1999</TIMEX>, as the result of program
mergers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern California</ENAMEX> has been the sole
LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>
covering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> has made significant progress in
developing a comprehensive, integrated delivery system to provide
high-quality services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern California</ENAMEX>. In
addition to instituting a programwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Counsel</ENAMEX> advocate
support/case review system, which emphasizes collaboration and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-counseling on common issues throughout the whole region, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSNC</ENAMEX> is
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coordinating</ENAMEX> and advancing a region-wide advocacy agenda in welfare
to work and housing and economic development. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> has also
developed additional resources for region-wide initiatives, such as
a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$120,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> grant from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Foundation</ENAMEX> to
increase the capacities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> community-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> was one of three geographical areas
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> involuntarily reconfigured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Area Legal Aid</ENAMEX> ("<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Legal</ENAMEX>") became the only LSC-funded
program for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area. The new
program, headquartered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>, was the result of a merger
between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance</ENAMEX> (SFNLAF),
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Legal Services</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Foundation</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Contra Costa</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FY</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Legal</ENAMEX> was the recipient of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175,235</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Technology Initiative Grant</ENAMEX>. This grant will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout the region to use networked
computer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> to easily access forms and information. In its
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Legal</ENAMEX> also successfully conducted a region-wide
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Campaign for Justice</ENAMEX>" fundraising effort which brought in
significant funds to all of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central California Region</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> LSC-funded programs
previously served the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> region. Today, the region
is served by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal</ENAMEX>
Assistance (CRLA), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central California Legal Services</ENAMEX> (CCLS) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greater Bakersfield Legal Assistance</ENAMEX> (GBLA). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs
created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Justice Consortium</ENAMEX>, a planning entity
dedicated to the vision of a seamless justice system in the region.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consortium</ENAMEX> is working on issues throughout the region,
including the legal problems of migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheepherders</ENAMEX> and health and
environmental issues affecting rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. In order to address
the access barriers that face rural and isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and
enhance communication between and among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs, the
programs have developed highly sophisticated video-conferencing
capability. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs have also agreed to allow and
encourage staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to move freely among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs in
order to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> needs most effectively.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Basin</ENAMEX>. As a result of the merger between the
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aid Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Beach</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Foundation</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, there are now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs serving this region. The
programs have hired a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Advocacy Coordinator</ENAMEX> who staffs the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Advocacy Project</ENAMEX> to respond to major issues that cut across
program lines and can be addressed most effectively by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>
from multiple programs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> projects jointly pursued
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Basin</ENAMEX> programs will address the diverse languages spoken
by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client population</ENAMEX>. Under a grant from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Society</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>, the programs contracted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian Pacific American</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center of Southern California</ENAMEX> to provide centralized intake
for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> who do not speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> require
extended service or representation, their cases are then matched
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs depending on the specific
language capabilities of each program. Through this project the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basin</ENAMEX> has found a way to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> who do not speak
<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
The programs are also poised to make a major investment in
technology to expand the delivery of legal services. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-</ENAMEX>CAN
project, funded initially by an LSC technology initiative grant,
was developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society of Orange County</ENAMEX> (LASOC) to
help "pro per" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> fill out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judicial Council</ENAMEX> forms in family
law matters. Future plans includes replicating I-CAN throughout the
region and locating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> that can be used by clients
for on-line filings of certain legal matters.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Region</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> programs in this region, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
Aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society of San Diego</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland Counties Legal Services</ENAMEX>, were
relatively late in region-wide planning. Recently, these two
programs have committed to an agenda of specific collaborative
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>, including joint technology consultations, joint efforts
by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Boards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> in areas of mutual interest, joint
economic development projects, and assistance in developing intake
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Both programs are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> of "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX>" grants to
run projects to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spanish-speaking</ENAMEX> "pro per" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in their
respective county <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouses</ENAMEX>. Both are also active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in
other statewide initiatives. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> have
both partnered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRLA</ENAMEX> to respond to migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> needs in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coachella</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX> valleys. However, significant integration
and planning work remains to be done in this area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Activities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> call for state planning coincided
with an active period within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX>. The
Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Commission</ENAMEX> was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> as a coordinating
body to seek support for legal services programs and develop
strategies to address the severe lack of access to justice that had
been identified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX>-sponsored blue ribbon study
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> consisted of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from the bench and bar, including many long-term
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> of legal services, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX>, and business, labor and
religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the provider
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> priority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> was resource
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development and the Commission</ENAMEX> led a sustained effort in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> to obtain state funds to support the
provision of civil legal services to lowincome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> appropriated, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> for legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. The same amount was appropriated in FY <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>
increase to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15 million</NUMEX> is expected for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> priority was the improvement of access
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> for "pro per" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>
dedicated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> appropriation for civil legal services
to fund innovative projects that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> legal services providers
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to assist low-income self-represented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX>.
With support from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC's Technology Initiative</ENAMEX> Grants, LSC-funded
programs are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s plan
to utilize technology to expand access and improve legal services
delivery. Other promising technology initiatives include the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CalJustice Technology Project of the Public Interest Clearinghouse</ENAMEX>,
which focuses on increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> access to the judicial system
through the development of an artificial intelligence-based tool to
help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> quickly spot issues in and strategize about cases.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has also recently adopted statewide priorities for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">connectivity</ENAMEX> and communication, developed minimum technology
standards and created mechanisms to share best practices.
Other statewide non-technology initiatives include:


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-program and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">inter-region</ENAMEX> collaborative projects to
develop new substantive expertise and new programs to respond to
changes in policy and law impacting upon low-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>;


•
A system of advocacy training and litigation support
through a network of support <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the areas of health, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>,
housing, and economic development;


•
The development of standards and assessment tools
tovaluate the support <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.




State planning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> with the formation of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Legal Services Planning Group</ENAMEX>. Represented in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> were LSC-funded programs, the organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX>,
both law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Trust Account Foundation</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>=s IOLTA program), the
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aid Foundation</ENAMEX> (the statewide fundraising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>=s
federally-funded legal services programs) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> of specialized
legal services and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> interested in the provision of
legal assistance to low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Early planning efforts focused on development of additional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, expansion of pro bono assistance and support from the
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and ensuring effective delivery of services by the
federally funded programs. Initial efforts addressed a variety of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> issues including training and support, increased use of
technology, more efficient and uniform intake and the provision of
legal advice and brief service, and meeting the needs of
particularly vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> and disabled
and institutionalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
Progress was made on a number of issues important to the legal
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, but despite signs of chronic weakness in two
programs, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-program LSC structure was left intact. During <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> competition, the service area of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these programs was
awarded to an adjacent program. The other received limited funding,
and ultimately was provided a very short grant. Together with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> Program Letters, this decision provided the impetus for more
serious discussion of program configuration which resulted in the
formation of a single statewide program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Legal Services</ENAMEX>,
effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 1999</TIMEX>.
The formation of a single statewide program was adopted to
breathe life into a single program that will provide meaningful
access to high quality legal services, in the pursuit of justice
for as many low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> as possible.@
This vision became a touchstone for decisions as to program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">governance</ENAMEX>, delivery issues, including office staffing, support,
training, technology, and increased access to high quality legal
advice, brief service and more extensive legal representation.
During the consolidation process, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corporation</ENAMEX>
technical assistance grants enabled the program to utilize the
services of a skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> and facilitator to move the
process to conclusion, to send program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to visit and observe
other programs with well respected and technologically
sophisticated centralized intake systems, to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to the
program to help design a transition to statewide administrative and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">personnel</ENAMEX> systems, and helped fund the statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> meeting
which launched and celebrated the new statewide program.
The goals of the single statewide program included establishing
uniform standards for high quality legal representation, increased
administrative efficiency and the provision of more effective,
accurate and helpful brief service and advice, increased training,
technical assistance and support for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, but particularly
for casehandlers in small remote rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and significantly
increased access for more low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Coloradans</ENAMEX> in need of service.
Many of these goals have been met and others continue as work in
progress.
Initiatives that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLS</ENAMEX> has undertaken to improve and expand
services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> on a statewide basis included:


•
The establishment of statewide priorities that pay
particular attention to the needs of rural, hard-to-reach
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>;


•
Increased training and advocacy support throughout the
state;


•
Detailed plans to initiate a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Client Access Plan</ENAMEX> which
will feature a highlycentralized telephone-based intake
system;


•
Vastly upgraded technological equipment, Internet access
and computer capability;


•
A new case information system that will provide improved
information about numerous aspects of the provision of legal
assistance to the low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> throughout the
state;


•
Casehandlers standards to be used as benchmarks by staff
in the representation of all program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.


Successful efforts have also been made to expand resources
necessary for the delivery of civil legal assistance to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indigent</ENAMEX>. Other efforts focus on how to increase pro bono
representation of both eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in
need of service provided by the federally funded statewide program,
and to locate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> for services that may not be available from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funds.
Increases in resource for civil legal assistance have
included:


•
Significantly expanded giving by law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>;



•
After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> of effort, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State General Assembly</ENAMEX>
appropriated funds in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX>) to serve the civil needs of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of domestic and family violence and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.

The coordinated and focused efforts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Group</ENAMEX>
have also brought major positive changes to pro bono activities
throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> including:


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Supreme Court</ENAMEX> revised Rule <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Rules of Professional Conduct</ENAMEX>, effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2000</TIMEX>,
to provide an aspirational goal that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> provide not less
than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 hours</TIMEX> per year of pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> each year;


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Supreme Court</ENAMEX> amended the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Code</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judicial</ENAMEX>
Conduct to more clearly specify that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> may engage in
activities to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to perform pro bono
service;


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Bar Association</ENAMEX>=s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Governors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> approved a set of guidelines to encourage pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> by
government and public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>;


•
A thorough review and revision of its Private Attorney
Involvement activities by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLS</ENAMEX> to further encourage pro bono
participation throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>;


•
Efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLS</ENAMEX> to maximize local pro bono participation
while further coordinating statewide technical assistance and legal
support provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> who participate in pro bono programs
as well as increased recognition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteer lawyers</ENAMEX> at both the
local and state level.


The relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>
in the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> has always been
positive. The consolidation of the federally-funded programs into a
single statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> has provided the opportunity for increased
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and collaboration throughout the state both within
legal services and between legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in the private bar, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and with
other key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituencies</ENAMEX>. It is expected that continued planning
and concerted effort will result in higher quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> provided
more uniformly throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in increasing
numbers will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> of a more thoughtful and better
coordinated state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> planning efforts began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> with The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida Bar</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Bar Foundation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Commission on the Delivery of Legal</ENAMEX>
Assistance study and report. Its recommendation to increase pro
bono engagement was addressed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Supreme</ENAMEX>
Court mandated pro bono reporting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Bar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
Recommendations contained in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> plan also resulted in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> of tri-annual peer reviews for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>) funded programs, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> LSC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Recommendations that programs improve
technology capacities were addressed in large part by a revolving
loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX>, established by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>, that enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> programs
and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IOTA recipients</ENAMEX> to purchase needed computer and related
technology. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s "companion system" was created to
serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> whom LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> could not
represent.
More recently, and in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s state planning letters,
planning moved to a new level when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>'s
largest legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> held a retreat to consider how to
improve civil legal assistance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical Assistance</ENAMEX>
Grant from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, matched by a grant from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Florida Bar Foundation</ENAMEX>,
enabled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> to retain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> who
has continued to guide the planning process.
At the retreat, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> examined changes in client
needs and the practice of law over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past ten years</TIMEX>. They asked
themselves what accomplishments they and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> were most
proud of, and how they could expand these achievements. They
considered ways in which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> civil legal services programs in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (including the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> LSC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>) should expand
partnerships to ensure that low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Floridians</ENAMEX> had access to a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> array of the highest quality legal services possible. They
realized that significant change in the service delivery system was
needed because of the increasing complexity of the practice of law,
the number of legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, the
restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> and, most important, changes in laws
and programs affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. It became clear that restructuring
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>'s delivery system could increase the work that made staff
most proud and brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> the best services. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The directors</ENAMEX>
developed the concept of "statewide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>-centered, energetic,
affirmative advocacy" as a key value against which to measure all
proposals for change. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were identified as:


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shared</ENAMEX> responsibility for the statewide delivery
system


•
Collaborative attitudes on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> and
programs


•
Strategic thinking about the most effective way to
achieve results for clients


•
Advocacy skills needed to provide effective, high-quality
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Client</ENAMEX> centered provision of services


•
Ongoing self-assessment


A survey was sent to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33</NUMEX> nonprofit civil legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> asking them to describe how they could become (or maintain
themselves as) energetic, affirmative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>, as well as what
support they might require and how collaborative efforts in the
state could meet those needs. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">273</NUMEX> responses from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
programs. The results were reported to the equal justice community
and posted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Legal Services</ENAMEX> website,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">floridalegal</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>.
The initial planning effort sparked by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> program directors
grew to become a broadly inclusive structure. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX>
represent key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> including funders, bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, among others. Its principal components
are:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oversight Committee</ENAMEX>. Consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida State Bar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Florida Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>, the statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standing Committee on Pro Bono Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project Directors Association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, this group guides the
planning process, seeks input from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, establishes a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timeline</ENAMEX> and gives final approval of the state plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action Committees</ENAMEX>. Charged with exploring problems and
opportunities in the areas identified in the project director
retreat and the advocacy survey, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision, Technology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislative/Administrative</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Advocacy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Client Access, Collaboration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">and Training</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical</ENAMEX>
Assistance. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> developed measurable goals with
estimated dates for completion. Close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> serve on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinating Committee</ENAMEX>. Composed of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chairs of the Action</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committees</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> considered the recommendations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committees</ENAMEX> and integrated them into a draft state plan.
Project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>. Consisting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33</NUMEX> nonprofit civil legal services
programs, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has responsibility for ensuring implementation
at the program level.
After circulation for comment to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> (the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest source of legal services
funding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>), local pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, local bar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations and Area Agencies on Aging</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oversight Committee</ENAMEX>
released the draft plan for public comment in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>. A
final version was adopted at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of February 2001</TIMEX>.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> Plan divides the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> regions, and
highlights a regional approach in its collaboration and
configuration strategies. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> houses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and other
nonprofit civil legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> bound together by a
commitment to collaborate. Programs in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> will sign an
"enforceable agreement" enunciating the specific activities each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> will undertake. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> to more carefully explore whether the current
configuration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and non-LSC funded programs is one that will
best advance their goals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> requested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> seriously
consider the advantages of having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> LSC-funded program anchor
each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> regions identified in the plan.
Programs have already moved to carry out some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plan</ENAMEX>'s
recommendations. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> programs receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> funds have
jointly hired a statewide resource <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>, along
with The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida State Bar</ENAMEX> and several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">law firms</ENAMEX>, have provided
funds to hire a statewide pro bono development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Planners</ENAMEX>
are seeking funds to improve the statewide website and expand
internet access to community education <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> beyond the current
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> education site for immigrant advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
Other initiatives include a statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child Support Task Force</ENAMEX> and
a statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma Lazarus</ENAMEX> Project.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regionwide</ENAMEX> efforts are also underway. In one region, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> LSC
programs have established a regional intake system, funded by an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Technology Initiative Grant</ENAMEX>, with a second planned for another
region, to be developed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. A region-wide community economic
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> initiative housed at an LSC program provides expertise
and other resources to all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IOTA recipients</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> region. A
regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Educational Advisory Project</ENAMEX> (involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
programs) to do outreach and advocacy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and a regional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team Child Project</ENAMEX> on joint advocacy between legal services
programs and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">defender offices</ENAMEX> for youth entering the
juvenile justice system have also been established.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Bar Foundation</ENAMEX>, which gives substantial funding to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33</NUMEX> nonprofit civil legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, has
pledged to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> evaluate each of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> on their state
planning work as well as their contribution to the regional effort.
Regional efforts will be a critical component of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>'s
tri-annual on-site peer review of each program. Thus, programs will
be measured not only on their individual contributions to regional
and state planning, but also on the quality of their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>'s
accomplishments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> anticipates that this approach to
evaluations will help maintain the productive pace of the past
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>' planning and emphasize the importance of joint endeavors.
Furthermore, planning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have indicated that configuration is
a priority for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, and have developed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> and
strategies to address this critical issue.


The LSC-funded programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> have a long history of
working together on joint projects, state support and other
matters. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> program letter, the
programs requested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois State Bar Association</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Bar Association</ENAMEX> join them in the planning process. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, under the authority of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar associations</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice Project</ENAMEX> was established. The mission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice Project</ENAMEX> included: protecting the integrity and
accessibility of the legal system for all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>;
educating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> about the self-help
process within the judicial system; and promoting costeffective
legal services for low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice Project</ENAMEX> brought together a very diverse group
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the low-income client
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, social service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, civil
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to address the need for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> costeffective legal services in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>. The project was governed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steering Committee</ENAMEX>. In
addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working groups</ENAMEX> were created: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Non-Adjudicatory</ENAMEX>
Problem <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Solving; User Friendly Pro Se Adjudication</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Delivery System</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project</ENAMEX> adopted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> guiding
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">principles</ENAMEX>:


•
Equal justice is a basic right, which is fundamental to
our democracy. Thus, the integrity of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and
our justice system depends on protecting and enforcing the rights
of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on an equal basis;


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> must be educated to protect their
legal rights and accept their legal responsibilities. They must
also have information about self-help processes and available
remedies;


•
The justice system must work with social services,
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to promote holistic,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multi-disciplinary</ENAMEX> approaches to preventing and resolving legal
difficulties;


•
Since demand for services continues to increase, legal
aid programs must be supported in avoiding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">duplication</ENAMEX>, maximizing
coordination and promoting effective use of existing and emerging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>;


•
Legitimate political discourse requires constructive
alternatives. Attacks on the current system, often based on
misleading anecdotes, have failed to enlighten <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> or
improve services to the public; and


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, which comprise our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX> system, are largely local. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">is an integral</ENAMEX>
part of the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> welfare and funding equal justice is a
fundamental obligation of state and county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.


Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working group</ENAMEX> met several times to develop recommendations
for changes to the legal services delivery system. The
recommendations were adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associations</ENAMEX>, and, along with an appendix of existing and proposed
implementation measures, submitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Assembly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>,
state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, legal services programs, bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> and
individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. The focus was on creating a true system of
equal justice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>. (The report also recognized work that
had already begun among all legal services programs with the
establishment of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Legal Services Delivery and Technology</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Group</ENAMEX>, which was meeting to share information on the use of
technology.)
As part of the goals developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice Project</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Associations</ENAMEX> agreed to support the
introduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Equal Justice</ENAMEX> Act in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Assembly.</ENAMEX> The bill failed in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997-98</TIMEX> session but passed
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>. Although stripped of any funding mechanism, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bill</ENAMEX> authorized the establishment the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Equal Justice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> to receive and distribute any money appropriated by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legislature</ENAMEX>. Finally, in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999-2000</TIMEX> session, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> was
appropriated. While <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than the $1,000,000</NUMEX> sought by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>, it is a start.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> commented upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois State Plan</ENAMEX> and
implementation to date. In its feedback letter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> noted that it
was "impressed with the steps you have taken and will continue to
take under this plan to develop an integrated and comprehensive
delivery system that is designed to meet the present as well as the
future needs of low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> within your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>." However, LSC
also asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> to reopen their consideration of the
configuration of the LSC-funded programs believing that "a thorough
review of this plan leads to the almost inescapable conclusion that
while reconfiguration may not be a front-burner issue within this
state, there is merit to seriously exploring reconfiguration of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> LSC-funded programs into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> also suggested that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> develop ways to involve more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and community
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> in the planning process and develop plans to expand
their funding base.
Reconsideration of the configuration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> has led
to decisions to consolidate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, final
reconfiguration of the LSC-funded delivery system will be
completed, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prairie State Legal Services</ENAMEX>,
Land of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago</ENAMEX>.
The programs have also followed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice</ENAMEX>
Project recommendations to consider more streamlined and
cooperative ways of operating. While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> initially had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
federally funded legal services programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> identified
another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> programs that were providing legal services to
the economically disadvantaged. Many of these programs were small
and most operated within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cook County</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-
ever meeting of all of these programs was held. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX> provided funding for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> facilitators and lodging and
meal costs were paid for by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois</ENAMEX>. The
programs met for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> to plan areas of need and cooperation.
Working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were established to coordinate training statewide,
to focus on the establishment of a statewide website and to
continue coordination and sharing in technology matters.
The programs continue to explore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> for improving services
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. With funding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Working Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CARPLS</ENAMEX> (the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based hotline and referral services), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prairie State Legal Services</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation</ENAMEX> have formed a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Best</ENAMEX>
Practices" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> have visited one another's
programs as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> additional model hotline/telephone intake
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. As they have observed better, more
efficient and more innovative ways of doing business, new
procedures have been adopted.
In cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIT Kent College of Law</ENAMEX>, legal services
programs are also involved in establishing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Center for</ENAMEX>
Law and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Interest</ENAMEX>. This will be a single database that
will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> portals for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate interest groups
including a portal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> that would provide them access to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client community</ENAMEX> legal education materials and self-help legal
materials. (This would expand upon materials that are currently
available from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Illinois Self-Help Center</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>
legal services website.) A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> portal would provide information
and video streaming training for pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>. The final
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">portal</ENAMEX> would provide access for legal services staff to training
materials, discussion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, legal research and other matters. The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in this collaboration have recently signed
agreements specifying the duties of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>. The site will be
located at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIT-Kent College of Law</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Equal Justice Foundation</ENAMEX> has recently made its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first</ENAMEX> grants from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">money</NUMEX> appropriated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois General</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX>. Because of the limited money available, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grants
were restricted to funding for civil legal services and hotlines.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Later this year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> will initiate a study to evaluate
the most effective way in which pro bono can be encouraged and
supported. At the present time, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pro Bono Center</ENAMEX>
whose function is to work with the organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and legal services
programs in encouraging participation in existing pro bono programs
as well as to help develop new pro bono programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>. The
focus of the study will be to determine what changes need to be
made in the existing structure to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> to effectively
meet its mission or, alternatively, to recommend a new structure.
This study will be funded by an LSC technical assistance grant and
will be coordinated with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> peer study.


In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> LSC-funded programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> submitted a
state plan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> that was seriously flawed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> were told
that their plan was "non-responsive to the issues identified in LSC
Program Letters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-1 and 98-6</NUMEX> and in need of major work." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>
was instructed to submit a revised plan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and develop a
"collaborative, inclusive and values-driven plan and planning
process that strengthens services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout the
state."
Serious planning within the legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX> began in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1999</TIMEX> with a commitment to "plan to plan" on the part of the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> LSC-funded programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> at that time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> gave
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> a technical assistance grant to hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to assist
with the planning efforts. Over the course of a long series of
meetings and discussions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> and staff
of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> programs reached the conclusion that if all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> were to have access to high quality legal services,
significant changes needed to be made in the configuration of
programs within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> of all
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> programs passed a resolution approving the concept of merger.
Although merger discussions continued among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> programs, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the programs did not vote in favor of the merger
plan, and therefore the plan moved forward with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> programs:
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Organization of Indiana, Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Indiana, Inc.</ENAMEX>
As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northwest Indiana</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX> joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Organization of Indiana, Inc.</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSOI</ENAMEX>) by transferring its assets to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSOI</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSOI</ENAMEX> then changed its
name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Legal Services, Inc.</ENAMEX> (ILS) and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2001</TIMEX>
became the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funded program in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> currently has a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-month</TIMEX> sub-grant agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Program</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Indiana, Inc.</ENAMEX> (LSPNI) which previously received an LSC
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grant</ENAMEX>, in order to attempt to reach an agreement with LSPNI
regarding transfer of staff and other assets from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSPNI</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX>. ILS
is opening an office in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Wayne</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maumee</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley, Inc.</ENAMEX> (LSMV) still operates. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSMV</ENAMEX> has non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funding to
represent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in specific substantive areas, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> and LSMV
are in the process of developing referral protocols to ensure that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> are referred to the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
The formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> is based on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Plan</ENAMEX>"
developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSOI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSNI</ENAMEX>. The plan describes the
legal work, allocation of resources, role of private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>,
role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client community</ENAMEX>, role of service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, governance
and program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and intake for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Legal Services, Inc.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Plan</ENAMEX> provides for a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>-member
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> that is appointed in proportion to poverty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> from
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> judicial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
The major values included in the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Plan</ENAMEX>" are:


•
The need to remain responsive to and work with local
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Legal Services Plan</ENAMEX> makes it clear that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> must look at problems faced by the lowincome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> from
both a state and a local perspective. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> is designed so that it
can bring together statewide resources in order to meet the needs
of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Priorities will be set statewide, but each
region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> will have its own case acceptance guidelines,
which will take into consideration local needs and resources. Each
region will have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Advisory Council</ENAMEX>, with a large number
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client representatives</ENAMEX>, which will develop these guidelines and
work with the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to ensure that it is meeting the
needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in the region.


•
The need to ensure high quality legal work. In order to
ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are linked to each
other, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> programs developed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Justice Center</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJC</ENAMEX> developed a website with both public and private sections
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">indianajustice</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> training events, coordinates
community legal education materials, oversees the pilot hotline
project and serves as a voice for legal services to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">judiciary</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJC</ENAMEX> also supports the work of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Round Table</ENAMEX>, which has a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> (senior law, consumer
law, public benefits, housing, family law, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> Law, etc.) to
which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> from throughout the state belong. These sections
meet regularly by conference call and in person in order to share
ideas and strategies and conduct training events. Each section also
has a "listserv," hosted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJC</ENAMEX>, and a section on the website
to which they can post pleadings and other documents that could be
useful to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Round Table</ENAMEX> sections are chaired by
casehandlers from throughout the state and responsibility for
organizing the agendas for meetings is shared. The philosophy
behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Round Table</ENAMEX> is that all legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> are
responsible for ensuring high quality legal work of the program.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Round Table</ENAMEX> sections also include non-legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>,
providing an opportunity to share expertise between programs. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Legal Services Plan</ENAMEX> also described the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pilot</ENAMEX> Hotline
Project, which was begun in an effort to increase the effectiveness
and efficiency of intake and advice. This Project is piloting new
telephone and case management systems so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> can determine the
most effective way of implementing a statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotline</ENAMEX>.



•
The need to expand funding for the provision of civil
legal services to low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> is the
last <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to have an IOLTA Program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Supreme</ENAMEX> adopted
Rule <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rules Professional Responsibility</ENAMEX>, which
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">establishes Pro Bono Committees</ENAMEX> in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judicial</ENAMEX>
Districts. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Committees</ENAMEX> are charged with developing and
implementing plans to meet the civil legal needs of low-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> through pro bono systems. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Committees</ENAMEX>' plans now
receive funding from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX> as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>. Each of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> has legal services representation, and many of the plans
are integrally linked to the current legal services pro bono
programs. Rule <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> also created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pro Bono Commission</ENAMEX>, which
oversees these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> and recommends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX> distributions to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBF</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBF</ENAMEX> is responsible for
the

IOLTA program and has worked with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and bar in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>
to launch a successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX> program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> continues to work with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Equal Justice Fund, Inc.</ENAMEX> (IEJF), a separate not for
profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> to raise funds for legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IEJF</ENAMEX> conducts an annual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> campaign, for the
benefit for legal services and legal aid programs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IEJF</ENAMEX> was also
instrumental in the passage of a general appropriation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana General Assembly.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> is also committed to

The need to bring stakeholders together on an annual
basis to continue the process of equal justice planning and to
celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>'s successes. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Center</ENAMEX>, with support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Pro Bono Commission</ENAMEX>, sponsored the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Annual Access</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Conference</ENAMEX>, a statewide meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>, bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>,
law school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, legal services and legal aid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and others to continue the
process of statewide Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> planning. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> people
attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">2001 Conference</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of whom were not from
legal services. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conference</ENAMEX>, attended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX> included presentations from bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> who reported on those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>' progress in state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX>, an update on state planning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> and breakout
sessions addressing technology, resource development, pro bono and
pro se. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">2001 Conference</ENAMEX> featured an introduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services, Inc.</ENAMEX> and an introduction of the new pro bono plans
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several of the 14</TIMEX> judicial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepard</ENAMEX> delivered keynote addresses at both conferences, calling
upon <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> state bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> to work
together in developing a statewide system that ensures equal access
to justice for all low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>

The need to expand the use of technology to provide
essential services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> has a technology plan that will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>, both staff
and pro bono, from throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to access information. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IJC</ENAMEX> website provides a place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> to share information.
The technology sessions at the Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conferences</ENAMEX> have
focused on how technology can be used to link <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> across the
state and across program lines, and how it can be used to directly
benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> by providing information and tools for pro se
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">litigants</ENAMEX>.
• The need to improve and expand the role of the private bar in
civil legal services delivery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> worked with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Supreme</ENAMEX>
Court to submit a successful grant application to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Justice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Statewide Pro Se Office</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Supreme</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court Administration</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> will work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> pro se
programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS Pilot Hotline Project</ENAMEX>, to
determine best practices for pro se support, and will develop form
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pleadings</ENAMEX>, approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, for use throughout the
state. These forms will be posted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJC</ENAMEX> website. This
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collaborative</ENAMEX> effort is a major step for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> in the area of pro
se support. These form pleadings will be used at pro se clinics
sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pro Bono Committees</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will oversee this
project, which will include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ILS</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Indiana</ENAMEX> differs from many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> have made considerable progress in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>
beyond the reconfiguration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funded programs but, unlike
other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> does not have a formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> conducts its planning activities through ad hoc groups
addressing discreet issues. In this way they have involved the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">judiciary</ENAMEX>, the private bar, law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, social service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>,
court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, legal services staff and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and clients
in their planning effort.


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>

-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>

In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, much of the groundwork for comprehensive state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX> had already been laid when the Corporation issued its
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> program letter on the subject in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the
Commission on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Needs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, chaired by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senator</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Muskie</ENAMEX> and made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioners</ENAMEX> drawn from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">judiciary</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>, the private bar, and the low-income
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, convened a series of hearings around the state and
issued a report calling for increased resources for legal services
with a number of recommendations for improving access. Under the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of an implementation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> created in the wake of
the report, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five years</TIMEX> a number of steps were taken
to increase and support pro bono participation in the delivery of
civil legal assistance, support pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX>, increase IOLTA
participation, and eliminate barriers to access. The state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legislature</ENAMEX> also followed up on the report by creating the
Commission on the Future of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Courts</ENAMEX>, with a similarly broad
composition. In response to its report, issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, a number of
steps were taken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to assist low-income and pro se
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">litigants</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, anticipating the imposition of restrictions on LSC
activities and cuts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funding, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Presidents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Association</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> sponsored a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-long</TIMEX> forum on the future
of legal services, attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> from the private bar, the
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, the state and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legislature</ENAMEX>, and executive branch. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> led to the creation of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Action Group</ENAMEX>, staffed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Association</ENAMEX> and
chaired by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">District Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank M. Coffin</ENAMEX>. Other members
included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Wathen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> (and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Member</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Dana</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidents</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Association</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Foundation</ENAMEX>, a member
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> each from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Maine School of Law and the Boards of Pine Tree</ENAMEX>
Legal Assistance and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elderly</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action Group</ENAMEX> undertook responsibility for overseeing the work of a
number of task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> for specific issue areas. The work of the
task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> was supported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Response Team</ENAMEX>,
consisting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of the legal services programs and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Association</ENAMEX>. A second
statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> took place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, focusing on the needs of pro se
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">litigants</ENAMEX>, with continuing follow-up from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>.
Among the most significant achievements resulting from these
phases of the planning process were the following:


•
A substantial increase in IOLTA rates at most major
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>;


•
Enactment of bipartisan legislation to increase court
filing fees and fines to provide funding for legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>;


•
Creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maine Equal Justice Project</ENAMEX>, to provide
representation of low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> before the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maine Equal Justice Partners</ENAMEX>, a network of pro bono litigators
willing to engage in administrative advocacy, class actions, and
other broad systemic advocacy;


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> and implementation, with substantial donated
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funding</ENAMEX> and in-kind donations, of a statewide technology plan,
enabling the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to computerize their operations
fully and to improve their telephone systems dramatically, as well
as creation of a shared "information technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>"
position housed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pine Tree Legal Services</ENAMEX>, the LSC
program;


•
Establishment of a new public interest fellowship program
named in honor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coffin</ENAMEX>, supported with funding by the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> largest law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX>. Between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Coffin</ENAMEX>
Fellows" housed at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine Tree</ENAMEX> have handled family law cases on
behalf of poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year since 1998</TIMEX>;


•
Creation of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Division</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to handle
family law matters and to be more responsive to the needs of pro se
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">litigants</ENAMEX>, accompanied by simplification of court forms and hiring
of a volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> within the court system to promote the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX> and training of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> to help pro se
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">litigants</ENAMEX>.


The cooperation among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> that marked these endeavors
has led to some exciting initiatives to improve and expand access
to justice for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Building upon its experience in
using technology to deliver services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 150,000</NUMEX>
pieces of community legal education material are downloaded
annually from its website--<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine Tree</ENAMEX>, with the cooperation and
assistance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrative Office of the Courts</ENAMEX>, has
developed an interactive program to assist pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> in
completing district court forms over the internet. The forms can be
created on line and then printed out in ready-to-file form. The
project, funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maine Bar Foundation</ENAMEX>, also permits
the internet posting of briefs and other materials by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pine Tree</ENAMEX>
staff to facilitate the representation of low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> by
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>.
Most recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine Tree</ENAMEX> has received a major grant from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Commerce</ENAMEX>'s prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Opportunity</ENAMEX>
Program to create the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HelpMe Domestic Violence Project</ENAMEX>. The project
will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of domestic violence to use teleconferencing
and videoconferencing technology and on-line filing to confer with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pine Tree</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>, prepare and file Protection from Abuse
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">petitions</ENAMEX>, and confer with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> if necessary, all without leaving
the security of a domestic violence shelter. The project will be
complemented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HelpMeLaw</ENAMEX> website, funded by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Technology</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Initiative Grant</ENAMEX>. The web site will serve as a comprehensive portal
for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mainers</ENAMEX> seeking legal assistance information of any
type, providing information from all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s legal services
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> as well as state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and other sources of
information and assistance.
All <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> participate in the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">consortium</ENAMEX> and have made their in-house training
events open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of all the legal service programs. For
instance, an intensive trial skills training program has been held
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Maine School of Law</ENAMEX> twice in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the past three</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, using donated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> drawn from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law School</ENAMEX> and the
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>--this event has been made available free of charge to
all staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine Tree</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elderly</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maine Equal Justice Project</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland</ENAMEX>

-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> has a long history of statewide planning. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Corporation</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> has supported various
efforts to examine and improve the statewide system, including the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland Legal Services Review Commission</ENAMEX> (the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardin</ENAMEX>
Commission"), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1992 Commission</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Needs of Low-Income</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Persons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Law Matters</ENAMEX>, and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> evaluation of the pro
bono system in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
In response to the restrictions and funding cuts imposed
nationally in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Association</ENAMEX> created the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland Coalition for Civil Justice</ENAMEX> (MCCJ) to spearhead and
oversee state planning. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCCJ</ENAMEX> drew together a wide spectrum of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> involved in the support and delivery
of legal services in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, including legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> and bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. Statewide
Conferences on the Delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> were held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 and January 2000</TIMEX>.
Recommendations from the planning process led to the development
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland Legal Assistance Network</ENAMEX> (MLAN), funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Open</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society Institute</ENAMEX> through a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> grant to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland Legal Services Corporation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLAN</ENAMEX> includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> component
programs:


•
A centralized statewide system of telephone access,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX>, screening, information, assistance, referral and service
evaluation;


•
Expanded pro se and unbundled legal services;


•
An expanded Internet-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People's Law Library</ENAMEX>-an
Internet-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyer</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lawyer Support Center</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> ranks at the top of the list nationally in the level of
funding for civil legal assistance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funding
represents <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 15 percent</NUMEX> of the total funding available. In
addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> with statewide responsibility--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLAN</ENAMEX>, the
LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Bureau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland Volunteer Lawyers' Services</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pro Bono Resource Center</ENAMEX>--there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30</NUMEX>
small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> that offer legal services to low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Some of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> are stand-alone
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> that target very specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> or legal
problems. Others are part of larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that focus on
specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> or legal problems. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> has
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that are very active in delivering legal services
to low- income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in a variety of areas.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> is also unique in the depth and focus of the support
that the civil legal assistance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> receives from key
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX> is very supportive,
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Judge</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s highest
court, being deeply engaged in planning efforts. The state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legislature</ENAMEX> provides significant bipartisan support for the legal
services delivery system. Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> also enjoys the
longstanding, active support and engagement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
Bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>, as well as numerous local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar associations</ENAMEX>.
Notwithstanding these successes, the equal justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> has continued to look for ways to expand and improve
services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.
Responding to concerns on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCCJ</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource Center</ENAMEX>, and others that, despite a long history of strong
pro bono commitment, some momentum appears to have been lost in
recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> established the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judicial Commission</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> to reinvigorate the pro
bono effort. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> is working to promote active leadership
and encouragement from the bench on a local level, with oversight
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX>, to increase bar participation and assist
providers in developing more innovative and creative opportunities
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>.
In addition, the MCCJ sponsored, with funding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Corporation</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project</ENAMEX> for the Future of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, a thorough evaluation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s delivery system by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John A. Tull</ENAMEX>. The study, completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-2000</TIMEX>, found
strengths and accomplishments and noted many remarkable features
from which other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> could learn. It also identified some lost
opportunities. It recommended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> broad strategies to address
these issues: increasing the flow of information among the
providers; establishing formal collaborative arrangements in areas
such as technology, planning and development, and substantive
support and training; and creation of a framework for more ongoing
planning and system-wide decision-making regarding issues affecting
the entire system, particularly with regard to substantive matters
not being addressed. The report concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCCJ</ENAMEX> should lead
in planning and overseeing the implementation of these strategies
at the statewide level.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>

-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>

State planning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> goes back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
LSC-funded programs in the state received a special planning grant
to identify areas for coordination and cooperation. The system in
place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is the result of the processes begun with that grant.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> worked with the newly created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Assistance</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disadvantaged Committee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Association</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSBA</ENAMEX>) to create the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota Legal Services Coalition State</ENAMEX>
Support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> and the position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volunteer Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>, now the Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
Bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> serving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 87</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> are known collectively as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Coalition</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX> programs, along with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, the Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>, and representatives
of other specialized legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> have continued to
meet regularly to discuss and coordinate on issues of statewide
concern.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, in response to the pending cuts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funding, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX> requested the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to
create a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme</ENAMEX>
Court, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSBA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to prepare
recommendations for state funding changes or other alternatives to
maintain an adequate level of funding for civil legal assistance.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Legal Services Access</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funding Committee</ENAMEX>, directing it to make recommendations to the
Court and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31, 1995</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Court</ENAMEX> appointed
a liaison from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> representing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legislature</ENAMEX>, the federal and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in private
and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>, legal services program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>,
including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client community</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Committee</ENAMEX> developed a number of principles,
including:


•
The legal services programs should continue to strive to
offer low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a level playing field, access to all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forums</ENAMEX>, and a full range of legal services in areas of critical
need.


•
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> should be structured to ensure that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with special needs, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX>, migrant
and seasonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with disabilities, and financially
distressed family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, continue to have access to legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>.



•
Adequate state support services, such as training,
community legal education materials and mechanisms for information
sharing, continue to be available to all legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>,
including volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> programs.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> report concluded that, "while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX>
programs and others are already a national model of coordination
and cooperation, the programs should continue to search for areas
in which they can achieve additional efficiencies and improve
client services through increased coordination and cooperation."
Among the other recommendations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Committee</ENAMEX> that have
subsequently been implemented are the following:


•
An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> registration fee increase to support legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, which has added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $850,000</NUMEX>, per year to the pool
available to grantees.


•
An increase from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> of an additional
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600,000</NUMEX> to the base funding for legal services beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>,
for a total state appropriation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.5 million</NUMEX> per
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>.


•
A planning grant from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> to identify
which technology applications would increase program effectiveness,
reduce barriers to quality service and increase the value of
services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, followed by a major implementation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grant</ENAMEX>.



•
Extensive education around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to encourage
implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA Rule</ENAMEX>

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.1</NUMEX> aspirational goal that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> donate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least 50 hours</TIMEX>
of legal services each year. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Committee</ENAMEX> recommended that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSBA</ENAMEX> consider reporting of pro bono activities. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSBA</ENAMEX> petitioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to require the
reporting of pro bono work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> denied the petition.


•
A significant increase in interest rates on many IOLTA
accounts by major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>.


Legal services programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> continue to work together
to integrate and provide a full range of services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> across
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX>'s jointly-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">State Support Center</ENAMEX>
continues to coordinate training and support functions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>
publishes a twice-monthly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newsletter</ENAMEX> for legal services staff and
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 2,500</NUMEX> volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. It conducts numerous CLE
accredited trainings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>, and coordinates bi-monthly
statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> meetings in the areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, housing,
public benefits, consumer, immigration and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> law. It also
coordinates the production and statewide distribution of community
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and self-help materials in many languages.
To assure each component of the system operates with the highest
quality and is integrated, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX>, with technical assistance
support from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, is developing a statewide peer review system. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX> programs have identified their goal as raising the level
of integration and cooperation among programs to that of a "virtual
statewide law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>."
Implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Technology Plan</ENAMEX> with
funding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> has represented a major step
toward achieving that goal. The plan sets forth a three-stage
process, with implementation beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> and continuing
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2009</TIMEX>. Phase of I of the implementation, scheduled for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-2000</TIMEX>, is largely complete. An LSC technical assistance grant
enabled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to begin planning for implementation of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Phase II</ENAMEX>,
scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-2003</TIMEX>. Initiatives completed under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Phase I</ENAMEX> of the
Plan include the following:


•
Bringing every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> up to a baseline level of
technological capacity;


•
providing every staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> with desktop internet access
and an individual e-mail account;


•
Developing a private website information geared toward
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> announcements, special training
materials, etc;


•
Developing a public website to create a legal services
presence online, providing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and program information, legal
education information, and other information for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>;


•
Creating e-mail lists and web forums for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Forces</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX> programs;


•
Developing technology planning, education and support to
enable all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and management to use technology as an effective
tool to improve service to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>; and


•
Providing all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> with on-line legal research
capacity, including online subscription to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Westlaw</ENAMEX> research, online
updates of recent developments in poverty law, and links on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statewide</ENAMEX> website to free online research resources.


A preliminary evaluation of Phase I, currently under way, has
found that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> are happy with the overall implementation of
the technology plan to date and believe that it has significantly
improved their program's capacity and their own individual capacity
to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> consider the implementation of the
plan to have made a profound difference in the way they do their
jobs. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> commented on the effectiveness of the new
technology in promoting closer relationships among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>.
Future phases of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Technology Plan</ENAMEX>, aided in part by
an LSC grant, call for streamlining the intake and case management
processes, developing seamless communication among all programs and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, improving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> access to services, integrating case
management software, and completing the transition to a virtual
statewide law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> proposal to support these efforts
is also pending before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>.
The programs continue to receive very strong support from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSBA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Assistance</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disadvantaged Committee</ENAMEX>, a planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980</TIMEX>'s,
continues to work in close cooperation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>'s most significant recent accomplishment
was the launching of the statewide probono.net/mn initiative, a
powerful web-based resource to support all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that are representing low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Missouri</ENAMEX> submitted its state plan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 1998</TIMEX>. On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 4, 1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> sent a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>
informing them that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> had serious concerns as to whether the
overall result of the plan would be the creation of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, integrated statewide delivery system. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> was
asked to continue its planning efforts and file a supplemental
planning report with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> on or before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 1999</TIMEX>.
In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, primarily because of the inadequacies of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri State</ENAMEX> plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> made the decision to renew <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grants to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> programs for a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This two-year</TIMEX> funding
decision was made to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> legal services programs the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and the opportunity to develop a viable, effective and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> state plan.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, assisted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> hired by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri Bar</ENAMEX> using technical assistance grants provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> legal services programs announced the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> Plan
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Access</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, a blueprint for action aimed at
delivering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major results over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next three years</TIMEX>:


•
To double the number of low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> served by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>'s legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>;


•
To increase by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> the total funding for legal
services statewide;


•
To achieve geographical parity, increasing the resources
available in rural areas to establish equal availability to legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX>;


•
To make funding available for a full range of legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>.


In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2000</TIMEX>, the plan was presented to key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> at a
meeting attended by, among others, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Executive Director</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri Bar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chair of the Bar's Committee on Delivery of Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Committee</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chair of the Statewide Legal Services</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning Committee</ENAMEX>, and other state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> supportive of legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> endorsed the plan and offered their support
for achieving its goals. The plan was presented and endorsed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri Bar Board of Governors</ENAMEX> at its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 29, 2000</TIMEX> meeting. It
has since been printed and made available throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri Bar</ENAMEX>.
To provide public accountability and support for the plan, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri Statewide Legal Services Commission</ENAMEX> has been chartered by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri Bar</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> is specifically charged with
assessing the effectiveness of the system for delivering legal
services to low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Missourians</ENAMEX> and assisting in advocating
adequate funding for legal services. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meeting was held on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 9, 2001</TIMEX>.
The following initiatives to implement the plan are currently
under way or planned:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Support Center</ENAMEX>. A new state support <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> has been
created to engage in legislative monitoring and advocacy, training,
coordination of statewide advocacy, collection and dissemination of
information, and coordination of the system of substantive law task
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">center director</ENAMEX> has been hired, and office space located.
The programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> are providing initial funding for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Substantive Law Task Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Structure</ENAMEX>. A statewide system of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> substantive law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task forces</ENAMEX> is being put into place. The
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> issue areas are Consumer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family, Income Maintenance</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">& Health</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disability</ENAMEX>. The leaders
of the task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> will participate in the task force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leadership</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> is developing statewide goals, strategies,
and priorities. The work of the task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> will be showcased at an
event celebrating the recent opening of the new state support
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>.
Legal Needs Study. With funding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Casey</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Missouri</ENAMEX> is
currently conducting a scientific legal needs study that will
provide a complete, accurate estimate of the need for civil legal
assistance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> substantive task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> are
cooperating in its design and analysis. The study will be completed
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2001</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX>, and every local
bar in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> will be invited to participate in a statewide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> campaign to announce its findings and build support for
responding to the needs it identifies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Southern Regional Delivery System</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> smaller programs in
the southern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeast Missouri Legal Services</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meramec Area Legal Aid Corporation</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid of Southwest</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>, merged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end of 2000</TIMEX>. The new entity is now known as
Legal Services of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Missouri</ENAMEX>.
Technology. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of a statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Task</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>, implementation of technology goals has begun. All legal
services programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are being brought up to minimum
technological capacities, technology training goals are being
developed and implemented, and technology-based support for the
task force system is being put into place, along with the
development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> access initiatives.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intake</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Intake and Advice Task Force</ENAMEX> will be convened in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> to examine ways in which to integrate and coordinate intake
and advise practices across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource Development</ENAMEX>. A statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development</ENAMEX> has
been hired as part of the planned emerging state support system. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Resource Development Action Team</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Rural</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Team</ENAMEX> will be convened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource Development</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action Team</ENAMEX> will use the results of the legal needs study to build
support for state funding for civil legal services, with the
participation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, and others, supported by a
public communications strategy and a grassroots support network.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Development</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> will target potential resources and
launch a campaign for rural resource development.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s state planning process began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1995</TIMEX>, when
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Bar Association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>
Legal Assistance (NHLA), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Hampshire Pro Bono Referral</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System</ENAMEX> convened a series of meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in the legal
services delivery system to discuss the design, configuration and
operation of the LSC-funded programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in light of
pending restrictions and funding cuts. Among those who participated
in the process were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin Pierce Law Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Children's</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance, Child</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Services of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disability Rights Center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Coalition Against</ENAMEX>
Sexual and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domestic Violence</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> of the New
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampshire Supreme Court</ENAMEX>.
From this process, a new non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Advice</ENAMEX> &
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Referral Center</ENAMEX> (LARC), was formed to apply for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funding. LARC
functions as a "hotline" that conducts most of the intake for the
Pro <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bono Referral System</ENAMEX>, provides advice and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> in specific
substantive areas (coordinated with other legal service providers
to prevent redundancy), refers cases requiring more than advice and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLA</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, and develops community
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and pro se materials. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLA</ENAMEX>, without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funding,
continues to provide a full range of legal services from regional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pro Bono Referral System</ENAMEX>
continues to serve low- income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> through
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of volunteer private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> secured their first-ever
state appropriation to maintain a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in the northern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The appropriation has
been sustained, and with strong support from the state IOLTA
program, a private bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX> and aggressive grant seeking, the
programs have increased their advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 40%</NUMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> sought and received an LSC
technical assistance grant to begin evaluating the new system they
created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, determining how well it works and what changes may
need to be made. The grant was matched by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Charitable Trust</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning Committee</ENAMEX>
meets periodically and the executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and key board
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LARC</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono</ENAMEX> meet frequently. A full staff
retreat of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs deepened the understanding among
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> about the goals of integration of legal services delivery
in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> and has led to the creation of a number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> and task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to further promote statewide
coordination. The scope of the planning process will be expanded by
including other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>-centered non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and a
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> all-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> retreat will be held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important outcome of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s recent planning was the
decision to combine the fundraising activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LARC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLA</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono</ENAMEX> Program, under the auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> has hired a resource <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> to
carry out this plan.
Coordinated planning has led to gains in other areas as well. In
technology, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs have achieved their baseline goals
of providing individual e-mail and desktop access to the Internet
for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, upgrading hardware, and enabling all the programs to
use the same database program. They are currently in the process of
developing a technology plan for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 18 months</TIMEX>. Some of the
topics under consideration are finalizing electronic data transfer
between all the programs, expanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LARC</ENAMEX> website into a legal
services community website, developing the capacity to distribute
pro se materials over the Internet, and redesigning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LARC</ENAMEX>'s
telephone system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLA</ENAMEX>'s technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> continues to
provide services to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LARC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono</ENAMEX> on a contract basis to help
maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> databases at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> programs and to preserve
and enhance the technological coordination among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
programs.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> are in the process of determining a cost-effective
method for determining the legal needs of low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampshire</ENAMEX>, to serve as the basis for a review and joint statement
of priorities among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> programs as well as public statement
of need. Also, under consideration is the designation of a
statewide community outreach and education <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> accepted an NHLA
proposal to use IOLTA funds to create a law school loan assistance
program to help address the burgeoning problem of law school debt,
which is driving talented law school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> away from legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>. In another example of cooperation and mutual assistance
among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s legal services programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLA</ENAMEX> urged that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LARC</ENAMEX> be allowed to participate from its inception and
recommended that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disability Rights Center</ENAMEX> be
allowed to participate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming year</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its first year</TIMEX> of
operation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LARC</ENAMEX> received an
average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,000</NUMEX> in tax free grants to help them pay law school
loans and stay in legal services.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Bar Association</ENAMEX> continues its long interest in
and support of full access to justice. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> statewide pro bono project and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> IOLTA
program, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar</ENAMEX> continues to house the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono</ENAMEX> Program and seek
new ways to expand its impact. Currently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX>'s Delivery
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Committee</ENAMEX> is attempting to involve government
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> in pro bono efforts, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Association</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Se</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>, chaired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Legal</ENAMEX>
Assistance, is working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to
create a courtsponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pro Se Task Force</ENAMEX> and launch a thorough
study of pro se issues in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>


The core legal services delivery system in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> consists
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> programs that maintain full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX>. Legal Services of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, a non-LSC funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,
administers the quite substantial non-LSC resources that support
legal services in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSNJ</ENAMEX> is both a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">funder</ENAMEX>/fundraiser and
a state support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> providing support to the field
programs in training, litigation coordination, pro bono
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordination</ENAMEX>, the establishment of accountability standards,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> development, technology support, support for service
delivery innovations, policy advocacy, major case advocacy, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statewide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. LSNJ coordinates all of the state taskforces,
holds regular meetings for project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and others and
routinely conducts program evaluations.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSNJ</ENAMEX> announced an intensive comprehensive statewide
analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s efforts to provide high quality legal
assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. This process was called "reengineering." In
reality however, little of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSNJ</ENAMEX>'s efforts effort went into
"reengineering" the delivery system since it, as well as other
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
were devoting considerable energies and efforts into developing new
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of funding to support the work of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> LSC-funded
programs in the aftermath of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> funding cuts and the
restrictions. These efforts were highly successful. Today, funding
for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> LSC-funded grantees in the state comes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> additional dollars come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX>, other governmental
units, and private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. On the average, only fifteen percent of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> budgets comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> issued Program Letter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">98-1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSNJ</ENAMEX> was already
nearing completion of its formal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> Master
Plan for the period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-2001</TIMEX>. The plan was developed with input
from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Jersey State Bar Association</ENAMEX>, specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar associations</ENAMEX>,
county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, public interest legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the major in-state funding sources, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA Fund of the Bar of New Jersey</ENAMEX>.
The overarching values underlying this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year</TIMEX> plan included:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the need for legal services programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> to function
as a "concerted, coherent, closely coordinated legal assistance
delivery system;" (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the need to develop additional resources to
expand access and improve quality of services within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
the need to incorporate the views of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in
making major decisions about how to design and implement a system
of high quality comprehensive legal services; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> access
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
Within this framework, the plan laid out initiatives to improve
and streamline every aspect of the delivery system's operations.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> priority was to continue to increase resources available
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> services. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> priority was to maximize the
efficient and effective expenditure of these resources and to
achieve enhanced outcomes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> by improving the core legal
services delivery system. The plan identified steps and strategies
to integrate the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> with a wider network of partners
involved in the delivery of civil legal services to low income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>.
As it enters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its third and final year</TIMEX>, upon implementation, this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> plan has led to the following accomplishments:


•
Creation of a statewide integrated intake
system;


•
Adoption of a uniform statewide case management
system;


•
Development of a coordinated statewide outreach and
community legal education strategy;


•
Adoption of advisory protocols for improving supervision
of legal work;


•
A comprehensive analysis of the full extent and nature of
the unmet need for essential civil legal aid for economically
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disadvantaged people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> (scheduled to be completed this
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>);


•
Creation of a technology infrastructure, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and implementation of strategies to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s
grantees are fully utilizing available technology to expand and
improve client services. These strategies include, but are not
limited to, statewide computer training, periodic visits--by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSNJ</ENAMEX>--to local programs to assess the effectiveness of their use of
technology, development of computerized intake questionnaires and
case handling protocols, coordination of activities with the courts
to help self-represented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> through the use of technology,
upgrading and updating programs' technology capabilities and
maintaining and enhancing desktop electronic research
capability;


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preservation</ENAMEX> and expansion of the capacity of legal
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to deliver essential legal assistance to
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, including a major statewide initiative to expand
the private funding base statewide;


•
Development of expanded pro bono efforts to supplement
the work of legal services programs;


•
Implementation of new statewide protocols for ongoing
program self-assessment;


•
Adoption of standardized performance criteria and
assessment for legal services staff;


•
Efforts to develop a uniform program performance
reporting system that will measure outcomes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> on a
statewide basis; and



•
Creation of an effective statewide capacity to conduct
research important to poverty law advocacy and extended
representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in areas of critical need.

In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSNJ</ENAMEX> has begun activities to develop its next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> plan (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002-2004</TIMEX>) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>. Key
points of exploration for this plan include:


•
A systematic look at best practices in highly-regarded
legal services programs nationally;


•
Utilization of the results of the comprehensive New
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey</ENAMEX> legal needs study, which is scheduled to be substantially
completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX>, to identify needs and establish
priorities for funding and for services;


•
Further refinement of those statewide core capacities
(which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> terms "necessary characteristics") required of a
highly coordinated and integrated statewide legal assistance
system;


•
The need for expanded research into delivery
options;


•
The need to promote experimentation and creativity in
developing new ways to deliver quality legal assistance to
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>;


•
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> evaluation of progress to date in meeting the goals
outlined in the current state plan with an initial report to be
completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX>;


•
A new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three- year</TIMEX> technology plan; and


•
As suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, a new look at program configuration,
particularly in light of both the positive experiences in other
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and the significant resources and energies that must be
devoted to the maintenance of a statewide delivery system that has
so many components.




Although some planning efforts took place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> in response to
the legislative changes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-1996</TIMEX>, the recent round of
successful planning efforts occurred because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent
events that merged to become an effective catalyst for change. In
late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Legal Assistance Foundation</ENAMEX> (OLAF)--a major
funder of civil legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>--launched a
process of comprehensive evaluation of each of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>,
including the LSC-funded programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. These in-depth
evaluations used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of respected legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> from
throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and assessed the quality and effectiveness
of each legal aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> with regard to legal work, client
involvement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and administrative functioning making
recommendations for improvement as appropriate. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1998</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> independently launched its state planning initiative and
selected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>--a state wherein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> separate programs
including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> programs that served a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX>--as one of its
priority <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. State plans were due into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 1998</TIMEX>.
However, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> was working closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> in planning
activities, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> quickly determined that any plan submitted to LSC
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 1998</TIMEX> would not meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s planning expectations nor
address the issues identified in Program Letters <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-1 and 98</NUMEX>-6.
Accordingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> granted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-month</TIMEX> extension
for submission of their plan urging them to develop "a planning
process that is values driven, articulates core capacities that
must be in place throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, is sensitive to the needs of
all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and is inclusive of all of legal services
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>. In addition… the planning process and the plan itself
(must) address the need for program collaboration and coordination
within the state…"
As state planning activities were slowly initiated, the program
evaluations launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> were also proceeding. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> extended
an invitation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> planning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> to
participate in the evaluation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSCfunded</ENAMEX> legal
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. She accepted the invitation.) As
evaluations were completed, it became increasingly apparent that
the many strengths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s civil legal assistance system
were offset by significant weaknesses, including variation in
quality among the programs, insufficient communication, and lack of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> responsibility for addressing problems on a statewide
basis.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Planning Steering Committee</ENAMEX> was formed to
coordinate existing planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and to make sure planning was
launched where it did not yet exist. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steering Committee</ENAMEX> was and
is composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of legal services programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX>,
law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, pro bono programs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client community</ENAMEX>,
communitybased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and the organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>. A consultant
was engaged by the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> to facilitate the planning
process. Using the "discussion draft" on the hallmarks of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, integrate statewide civil legal assistance system
prepared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project</ENAMEX> for the Future of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice</ENAMEX> as a model,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> adopted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as two</NUMEX> overarching goals: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the need for the
creation of a legal services delivery system that provides
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX>, integrated high quality legal services to the client
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) "<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> access to essential legal services for
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">low-income Ohioans</ENAMEX> such that they are able to secure substantive
and procedural equal justice." Measuring the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> in the
state against that vision, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the planning process
quickly came to the realization that significant change was
necessary.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steering Committee</ENAMEX>, working through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittees</ENAMEX>, produced
a draft report setting action plans for activities aimed at
building an integrated, statewide delivery system. The plan was
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, including all program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX>,
who then met as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1999</TIMEX> for a frank and open
discussion about configuration. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio State Plan</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Toward</ENAMEX>
Achieving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Integrated Legal Services Delivery System</ENAMEX>
was submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1999</TIMEX>. It was quickly approved and the
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two years</TIMEX> since
then refining and implementing the plan, mobilized by a new energy
and a renewed sense of purpose.
A key component of the plan was the decision was to reduce the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> LSC-funded programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> regional delivery
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. The reconfiguration process took place over the course of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> and has now been completed. In addition to the LSCfunded
programs, there are non-LSC-funded programs in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> regions, as
well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> statewide non-LSC funded programs: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro-Seniors</ENAMEX>, which
serves senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice Foundation</ENAMEX>, which
provides litigation advocacy; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSLSA State Support Center</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSLSA</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Planners</ENAMEX> also identified the development of an integrated and
coordinated statewide intake process as an essential component of
an effective delivery system for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Among the specific
goals were the following:


•
Establish telephone access for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in those parts of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> where it did not exist.


•
Create centralized regional telephone intake systems in
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> new service delivery regions for all LSC-funded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>, as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> where possible.


•
Establish a statewide telephone service with a toll-free
number that will route <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> to the appropriate regional intake
system.


•
Standardize intake and case management software among
programs to expedite intake and referrals.


•
Study systems other programs use to provide advice and
brief services to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and development of recommendations as to
how these service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> can be standardized from program to
program.


Currently, most of the regions have developed or are developing
a regionwide intake system, with the assistance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> and
funding provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Legal Assistance Foundation</ENAMEX> and funds
granted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> under a technical assistance grant. Several of these
regionwide intake systems are extremely innovative and offer
potential as a prototype for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> created
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1998</TIMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Coordinator</ENAMEX> hired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1998</TIMEX>,
supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> funds and originally housed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSLSA</ENAMEX>, the state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> adopted a technology plan in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> that set minimum
technology standards for all programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, as well as
long-term goals.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Technology Coordinator</ENAMEX> launched a
Technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force</ENAMEX>, made up of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from each
program, one who is responsible for technology matters and one who
can effectively communicate how their program provides services to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client community</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> have now met most of the
standards, which include upgrades of computer hardware and
software, computers for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, desktop internet access,
individual e-mail, and electronic legal research capacity. The
state has a statewide website and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> are considering
web-based intake.
The plan includes a heightened commitment to client empowerment,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> and community education, and expansion of pro se options.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSLSA</ENAMEX> is coordinating a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Se</ENAMEX> Project funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> to develop standardized pro se materials for
use across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, set up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pro se pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> in rural
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and develop training materials for pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has
awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">State Support Center</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Integration Grant</ENAMEX> for
development of web-based pro se assistance with tutorials for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of domestic violence. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAPIL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fellow</ENAMEX> is cataloguing all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> education material currently in use throughout the state
and reviewing them for accuracy, duplication, and needed changes.
New mechanisms for effective and efficient dissemination of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> education materials will be developed by community
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and technology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>.
Legal work is coordinated through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSLSA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Litigation</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force</ENAMEX>, which was created during the planning
process. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> has set <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> initial goals: to prioritize,
coordinate and develop a work plan for legal work on a state-wide
and regional level; and to develop resources to support this legal
work through pooled resources of programs, collaborations with law
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, special funding from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, and the
creation of additional task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSLSA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> also play important roles in the area of
training. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> funds training for the state civil legal services
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> and coordinates training for various pro bono projects.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSLSA</ENAMEX> has primary responsibility for coordinating and delivering
training to legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. There have been
a number of successful statewide substantive law training
conferences. The statewide website has a calendar of training
events and related information, and a statewide brief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> that can
be accessed by all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> is in the works.
During the planning process, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> recognized that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mobilizing</ENAMEX> and involving the private bar in the legal lives of
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s weaknesses. Accordingly,
the planning process resulted in the establishment of a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono</ENAMEX>
Work Group to develop and implement a state pro bono plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> has
designated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in this area. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> is working to expand, enhance and coordinate pro bono
initiatives and integrate pro bono programs with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>-based
delivery systems, with the ultimate goal of raising the current
statewide participation rate in pro bono programs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under 10</NUMEX>
percent to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 percent</NUMEX>. As part of this effort, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> Attorney
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> recently announced pro bono policies for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">governmental</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Supreme</ENAMEX>
Court sent a letter to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in the state urging
participation in pro bono work. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> is also experimenting with an
innovative project to link <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> and
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> through faith-based pro bono projects in areas
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> where pro bono participation is low.
The civil legal assistance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has a long history of
collaborative fundraising endeavors. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> has been extremely
successful in obtaining diversified state funding for legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> and has one of the highest levels of state funding in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio State Bar Association</ENAMEX> received the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prestigious Harrison Tweed Award</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> in recognition of its
efforts to help expand funding for legal services. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> has
succeeded in significantly increasing IOLTA funding in recent
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The initial planning report submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1999</TIMEX>
ranked continuing attention to resource development as a very high
priority and outlined steps to ensure continued support for legal
services from filing fees, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> registration fees, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX>, and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLAF</ENAMEX> continues to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> to try to generate
general revenue funding. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important new resource has been the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, which initially provided <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$350,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>,
raised to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> legal aid
capital campaigns have each raised significant funding for their
capital campaigns--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 million</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.5 million</NUMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>

-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>'s state planning process began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> with the creation
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon State Bar Legal Services Task Force</ENAMEX>, convened by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX> in consultation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force</ENAMEX> included the
Chair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit</ENAMEX>
Court and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> from the private bar, as
well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon State Bar Board of Bar Governors</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force</ENAMEX> worked through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittees</ENAMEX> organized around the
following broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Client Need/Priorities</ENAMEX>, Structure and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization, Funding</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethical Responsibility/Quality</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurance/Transition</ENAMEX>. They gathered information from a wide range
of legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, including law school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state Protection</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advocacy Agency</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juvenile Rights Project</ENAMEX>,
and pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and others in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> concerned about
services to low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>. Each of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subcommittees</ENAMEX> reported to the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>. A final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force</ENAMEX>
Report was issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. Since then, activities have been
coordinated through an Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Network</ENAMEX> that includes all
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> involved in planning efforts. Statewide Access to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conferences</ENAMEX> were held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 and 2000</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Planners</ENAMEX> continue
to involve an impressive array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the bench, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX>, and legal services and social
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. Work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have been created on all key
issues. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX> funded a statewide legal needs
assessment to inform the ongoing planning effort.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Planners</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> have made resource development their highest
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">priority</ENAMEX>, concluding that a substantial infusion of new resources
is the key to achieving a comprehensive, integrated statewide
system that provides access to justice for all. Under the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar's</ENAMEX> Campaign for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice</ENAMEX>, the state
has had considerable success. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campaign</ENAMEX> has been raising more
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> from private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> funding
accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional $400,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>. The state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>
have set a goal of a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 per cent</NUMEX> increase in funding over the next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>, with an ultimate goal of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> state
dollars. Currently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX> is considering a bill that will
charge out-of-state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> a fee to practice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>. If
passed, this is expected to generate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $150,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, all
of which will go to LSCfunded programs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Supporters</ENAMEX> of legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> are also working with state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Fund</ENAMEX> appropriation for legal
services programs to augment the dollars generated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> through
filing fee add-ons that are also directed to legal services
initiatives.
Cooperative efforts among the court system, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, and legal
service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> have made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in improving access to
its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. A successful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> project, funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, to
employ facilitators to assist pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> is being expanded to
additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. The facilitators help to improve fairness in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX> system by assisting pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> in a variety of ways,
including reviewing pleadings for errors. Legal service providers
continue to work with a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judicial Conference</ENAMEX>, to improve pro se forms and instructions in
additional areas of the law, beyond domestic relations. State
planning strategies have also opened up other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> for improving
outcomes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. Creative partnering between legal services
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon Farm Bureau</ENAMEX> resulted in a successful mediation
program, housed at the LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Services of Oregon</ENAMEX>,
that resolves disputes between farmworkers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX>.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> LSC-funded programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services of Oregon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lane County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Service</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marion-Polk</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aid Service</ENAMEX>, as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> non-LSC-funded programs and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Non-Profit Legal Services</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon Law Center</ENAMEX> was
specifically established to ensure access for disfavored client
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and issues restricted for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. Building on a
long history of close coordination of legal work, the programs
collaborate through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>--domestic relations,
administrative law, housing, migrant and elder law. The task forces
are facilitated by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> from the various programs, and
meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX>. All programs participate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX>-counseling across
programs occurs routinely, and expertise is regularly shared. The
programs have cooperated on a statewide training needs assessment,
and advise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon State Bar</ENAMEX> on continuing legal education
events for private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to ensure that poverty law issues are
included.
In the areas of technology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> have targeted a number of
long-term changes, including upgrading hardware and software, use
of videoconferencing for rural intake, and creation of a statewide
legal services web site. Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aid Services of Oregon</ENAMEX> has received
a federal <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Violence Against Women Act</ENAMEX> grant for a videoconferencing
pilot project that will permit remote intake from domestic violence
shelters in rural areas without legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The program
also received an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Technology Innovation Grant</ENAMEX> for a web-based
pro se project in conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon Judicial</ENAMEX>
Administration for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Law</ENAMEX>.
Although reconfigration of the LSC-funded programs has not been
a priority issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> to examine
whether maintenance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> continues to
make sense.


Prior to development of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> state plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was fragmented and performing unevenly.
Nearly, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> LSC-funded programs were
receiving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> funding because of quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>, and at
least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> was on the verge of receiving no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> programs were also competing with one another for LSC
funds. And, as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Plan</ENAMEX> observed:
"It had never been a state role to say it's not acceptable that
those in need in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> have less access than those
in another part, or that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area have less effective
legal assistance than is available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in other parts of the
state."
Indeed, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> sent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC Board</ENAMEX> meeting to object to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s state planning initiative;
and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later that month</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> traveled to
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> to reiterate those views.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years later</TIMEX>, much has changed. With strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and
financial support from key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> of the justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> is in the midst of implementing a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> state plan to "transform … a collegial confederation
of independent programs into a statewide integrated service
delivery system." Key features include:


•
Redesign of the delivery system by creation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> regions
and consolidation of the LSC programs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 to 8</TIMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> was
required to develop its own plan for a full service regional
delivery system, with sufficient capacities in the areas outlined
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s program letters. Periodic reports are submitted to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Steering Committee</ENAMEX> assessing whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> has each
capacity in place, and if not, what steps are to be taken to put it
in place. The program consolidations have been completed, and each
region is moving forward on its delivery plan.


•
Creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Support Team</ENAMEX> housed at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Legal Services</ENAMEX> to provide statewide support and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> core areas enumerated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
Plan--training, resource development and technology. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> new
positions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource Development</ENAMEX>, Technology
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coordinator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">and Training</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Information Facilitator</ENAMEX> are
supported by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> funding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania IOLTA Board</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Legal Services</ENAMEX>.


•
Development of a permanent state planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> with
a strong determination to build a better system. Made of up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Bar Association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Legal Services</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directors Association</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steering Committee</ENAMEX> meets by conference
call on a regular biweekly basis and assiduously oversees
plan


implementation. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">both 1999 and 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> published
formal progress reports on implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Plan</ENAMEX>.
Recent accomplishments in addition to the major structural and
leadership changes include:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource Development</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Bar Association</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Delegates</ENAMEX> has approved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> and
Recommendations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force on Legal Services</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Needy</ENAMEX>,
which called for a set of initiatives to increase funding and pro
bono:


•
Expansion of pro bono programs;


•
Establishment of coordinated pro bono assistance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX> without existing pro bono programs;


•
Judicial encouragement of pro bono programs;


•
Greater law school participation in pro bono;


•
Increased leadership in the pro bono area by senior bar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>;


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institution</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5</NUMEX> add-on to continuing legal education
fees to increase funding for legal services by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX>;


•
Legislation to increase funding for legal services
through an increase in court filing fees; and


•
Direction of cy pres awards to legal services
programs.


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLE</ENAMEX> fee increase is pending before the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Bar Association</ENAMEX> has launched an effort to
encourage all local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> to adopt a pro bono plan.
In addition, the statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resource Development Coordinator</ENAMEX> has
established a staff-level statewide resource development committee
that meets regularly by conference call, created a marketing
brochure aimed at funders, provided direct technical assistance to
regional fundraising efforts, and developed several major statewide
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grant</ENAMEX> proposals.
Technology. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> have met the key standards set out in
the technology plan adopted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. There is a statewide website,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palegalservices</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>. The state support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is working with the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> regions to develop a web-based case management system that will
support a new intake system for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
Coordination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Work</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Training</ENAMEX>. Creation of a statewide
brief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> is under way, with funding from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>. The statewide substantive task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> have been
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reinvigorated</ENAMEX>, with support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Training</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Information</ENAMEX>
Facilitator, who has established substantive e-mail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and
organizes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> meetings, in addition to planning and
organizing a number of statewide substantive training events.
Next Steps. In its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX> report, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Status and Achievements</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Effort</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998-2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steering</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> identified some next steps:


•
Deciding the best ways to organize regional phone
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">intake/</ENAMEX>advice systems and finding the funding to fully staff
them;


•
Determining how to deliver a full range of services in
those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>, which presently lack the institutional capacity to
do so;


•
Expanding on successful pro se assistance efforts to
develop more and stronger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>;


•
Strengthening the resource development and marketing
efforts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by developing a recognizable
identity and compelling message for legal services in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>,
and staffing effective regional resource development
efforts;


•
Continuing to develop the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLS</ENAMEX> website as a statewide
asset by incorporating new plans such as the brief/materials bank
and pro se assistance <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and finding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> such as bar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> who might share content;
and


•
Keeping alive the conversations begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> as a
vehicle for continuing momentum into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001 and 2002</TIMEX>.


The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Steering Committee</ENAMEX> has recently expanded its
membership by adding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLS Steering Committee</ENAMEX> which
includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Clients Council</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>


<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> Strong collaboration among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> LSC programs,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina Bar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appleseed Justice Center</ENAMEX> (formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina Legal Services</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>), has been a hallmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>'s planning
since the initial response to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> federal budget cuts and
restriction. At that time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina Bar</ENAMEX> adopted a dues
check-off for legal services, earmarking <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> for the former state
support <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina Legal Services Association</ENAMEX>. The Bar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> also increased its financial support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Association</ENAMEX> in order to preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>'s
well-respected support and advocacy capacity. And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, largely
due to the efforts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina Bar</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Association</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>, over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX>'s
veto, adopted a filing fee add-on to support the LSC programs.
State planning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> occurs under the auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Coordinating Council</ENAMEX>. Formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, at the request of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Structure Task Force</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
from each legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina Bar</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appleseed Justice Center</ENAMEX>, and an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina Bar Foundation</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>'s initial planning efforts focused on the creation
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LATIS</ENAMEX>, a statewide centralized access, advice and referral
system. Capitalized by a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$353,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> grant, and a
subsequent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$46,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina Bar</ENAMEX> donation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LATIS</ENAMEX> began
operations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999</TIMEX>. LATIS varies from most centralized
access, advice and referral systems in that it is a separately
incorporated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> governed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> from the
legal services program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Foundation</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina Bar</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appleseed Justice Center</ENAMEX>. Operating
expenses are paid by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> legal services programs for whom
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LATIS</ENAMEX> provides a central access point.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>'s collaborative efforts produced another success
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> awarded the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s
largest Technology Initiative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant</ENAMEX>--<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two-year</TIMEX>
project that will establish a virtual legal aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in every
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> that do not have legal
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. This project, called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Partners for Justice</ENAMEX>" is a
cooperative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX> among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> LSC programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LATIS</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appleseed Justice Center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina Bar Pro Bono Program</ENAMEX>,
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> human services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
The virtual law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> will allow real-time video-conferencing
between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, broadcasted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> on a variety of
topics, including pro se workshops and legal education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>, and
access to streaming video training <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">capsules</ENAMEX> and pro se pleadings.
They will be housed in a variety of locations, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>,
elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Ways</ENAMEX>,
victim services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The legal services
programs have entered into written partnership agreements with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
entities across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that have agreed to house the work
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stations</ENAMEX> and provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to be trained to assist potential
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> with computerized access to legal services programs and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">attorney providers</ENAMEX>.
Other efforts currently under way or planned include the
following:


•
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> programs have adopted uniform, statewide case
priorities.


•
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technology Standardization Committee</ENAMEX> ensures statewide
coordination of technology acquisitions and upgrades, and a Forms
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standardization Committee</ENAMEX> ensures standardization of paperwork and
administration among the programs. A common case management system
has been installed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LATIS</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> programs, and a Case
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Committee</ENAMEX> assures the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> meets the changing needs of
each program.


•
Programs are working on reducing administrative costs
through collective purchase of insurance, supplies, research
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, fringe benefits, and the like.


•
Accountability standards are being developed by the Bar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX> to ensure that each program creates strong ties within
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> with the goal of building local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> support and
involvement and increasing local fundraising.


•
To address the relatively low level of participation in
the delivery of legal services by volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> at the local
level, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina Bar Access</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Committee</ENAMEX> has
recommended, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> is entertaining a grant
request, to support the creation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralegal</ENAMEX> position in each
program to facilitate increasing pro bono participation.


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appleseed Justice Center</ENAMEX> coordinates training and
education activities for program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to
develop expertise in areas of poverty law practice, to update
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> on new developments and emerging trends in law and
policy, and to ensure the use of new strategies, tools, skills and
advocacy. Techniques. It also provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> case assistance and
coordination of the statewide substantive law task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. A system
of statewide litigation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> is being developed.


Even with these successes, state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> believe consolidation
of the LSC programs will produce a more unified and stronger voice
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and assure greater consistency and a full range of
services throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. With planning assistance funds from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> has hired a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to help the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinating Council</ENAMEX> develop a reconfiguration plan to be submitted
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this March</TIMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah</ENAMEX>

-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>

In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, at the request of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX>, ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX> to form the Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Task</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>, charged with reviewing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of legal services for the
poor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, exploring new ideas for improving and expanding those
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, and making recommendations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bar</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme</ENAMEX>
Court to implement improved services.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force</ENAMEX>, co-chaired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme</ENAMEX>
Court and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX>, included federal and
state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, senior
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counsel</ENAMEX>, an assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> and an assistant Attorney
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean</ENAMEX> of the state law school and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham Young University</ENAMEX>'s law school, bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> and the
pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> of the state bar, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
serving low-income and minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> legal services programs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force</ENAMEX> submitted its report and recommendations to a
meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah State Bar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1997</TIMEX>, leading to the
formation of the Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Foundation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. The Access
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Foundation</ENAMEX> continues to be the vehicle for state
planning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, charged with implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force</ENAMEX>'s
recommendations for improving the delivery of legal assistance to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">low-income Utahns</ENAMEX>. Among the initiatives currently under way as a
result of these efforts are the following:


•
The unified statewide "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Justice for All</ENAMEX>" fundraising
campaign was launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its first year</TIMEX>, the campaign
raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$410,000</NUMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, that figure rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$495,000</NUMEX>. For the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> campaign, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> has already been pledged by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> as
matching funds. Proceeds from the campaign are shared among
providers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multicultural Legal Center</ENAMEX>, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to
provide advocacy in areas restricted to LSC-funded programs, was
created.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah Legal Services</ENAMEX>, the LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disability Law Center</ENAMEX> are applying
for a grant to house the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> collaborating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> together on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site, to be known as the "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Legal Center</ENAMEX>."


•
Legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> are working closely with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah State Bar</ENAMEX> to maximize the latter's pro bono projects by
providing training in poverty law issues to potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>.
Recent initiatives have included intensified efforts to train
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to provide representation in domestic violence
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s SSI termination cases.


•
With the encouragement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah Legal Services</ENAMEX>, the state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrative Office of the Courts</ENAMEX> is studying the "self-service
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>" model used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> to help pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> for
possible replication in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Planners</ENAMEX> are considering how best to implement the Access
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Task Force</ENAMEX>'s recommendation that a shared centralized
intake system be established for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> of legal and social
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. As envisioned, this
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> would eliminate duplication of intake services and provide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> with instant links to appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. Although
legislative efforts to obtain state funding for legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> have
not been successful to date, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> hope that the legislature
might be willing to provide funding to implement such a system,
along with other technology-based projects to expand access to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX>.




<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>



<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s state planning has been led by the Access to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Board</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> was created by the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, and charged with expanding resources for civil legal services
and coordinating their delivery. Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, appointed by the
Court, represented a range of civil legal assistance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>,
including the bench, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
(which administers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX> funds), LSC-funded programs and volunteer
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One year later</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> federally-funded legal services
programs requested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATJ Board</ENAMEX> appoint a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> to
oversee the planning process outlined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> Program Letter.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> led a broad planning process and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1995</TIMEX>,
adopted the two documents which guide the delivery of legal
services within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Visioning Justice:</ENAMEX>
Hallmarks of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Civil Legal Assistance Delivery System</ENAMEX> and
the Plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delivery of Civil Legal Services</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Low-Income Persons</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington State</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> documents define the mission of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>'s civil legal assistance delivery system, express key "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Values</ENAMEX>" and attempt to identify corresponding "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Core</ENAMEX>
Capacities," to serve the mission. The fundamental principles of
these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> documents can be summarized as follows: (a) legal
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> must be "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>-centered," i.e., activities must
be conceived and carried out in service and in concert with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> that are being served; (b) legal services providers
must strive to ensure the highest and best use of all available
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and available to the
statewide access to justice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>; and (c) legal services
providers have a special responsibility to ensure that no
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client group</ENAMEX> is written out of the justice system
based on perceived political unacceptability or controversy.
As a result of these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> planning activities, the Access to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Board</ENAMEX> reconfigured the delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and
created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> statewide legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Justice Project</ENAMEX> (NJP)--to coordinate and
supplement the activities of an extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of legal services
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>, pro bono projects, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> within
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJP</ENAMEX> is the LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>. NJP
operates CLEAR--<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinated Legal Education</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Referral System</ENAMEX>--
to provide telephone and internet-based referral, advice, brief
service, community legal education and intake services throughout
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Legal Services</ENAMEX> receives no LSC funds. As part
of its mission within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX> is responsible for providing lowincome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">State</ENAMEX> with the ability to define, assert, promote and
enforce a full range of legal rights within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s civil
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX> system.
Key components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s planning and coordinating
structure include the following:



•
Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Board</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATJ Board</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>
and work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> act as accountability mechanisms, clearinghouses,
and coordinating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> to ensure that

the goals of the equal justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> are achieved. The ATJ
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> makes regular reports to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and the
governing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the state bar on the progress of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>
and work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in implementing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Plan</ENAMEX>.


•
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Annual</TIMEX> Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Conference</ENAMEX>. Now in its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> event has become the keystone event for the entire
statewide equal justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conference</ENAMEX> has generated a
higher level of participation and sense of community. Each has
included a broader spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, culminating, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>,
in a joint judicial, bar, and equal justice conference attended by
over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Justice Coalition</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition</ENAMEX>, created by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATJ Board</ENAMEX> and underwritten by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> Fund, has spearheaded a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year-long</TIMEX>
campaign to solidify broad, bipartisan support for funding for
civil legal assistance


•
"ComTech" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications/Technology</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>. This ATJ
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> drew the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s first communications/technology
blueprint and oversaw its statewide implementation, resulting in
interconnectivity for the entire civil legal services delivery
system. Most recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ComTech</ENAMEX> has teamed up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Administrator of the Courts</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition Against Domestic</ENAMEX>
Violence to pioneer innovative interactive forms project to improve
the justice system's responsiveness to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Committee</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATJ Committee</ENAMEX> is responsible
for ensuring that the culture of the judicial system is one that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">demonstrably</ENAMEX> values equal justice. Among its strategies are
judicial training and introducing the concept of equal justice into
the judicial screening process. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Committee</ENAMEX> sparked the
creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Legal Education Council</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>-member body
created by joint initiative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction</ENAMEX>, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> has adopted goals
and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multiyear</TIMEX> strategy to help the public understand their rights
and responsibilities and their options for complying with those
responsibilities and asserting those rights.



•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems Impediments Committee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Status Impediments</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems Committee</ENAMEX> is charged with "identifying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">judicial</ENAMEX>, legislative and administrative system impediments to
access to justice and recommending and implementing appropriate
changes." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Status Committee</ENAMEX> is charged with "identifying and
removing impediments to the justice system for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose status
(e.g., physical or mental limitations, disability, race ethnicity,
language, cultural or other differences, remoteness or physical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolation</ENAMEX>, etc.) makes meaningful access to the system more
difficult." Current activities include the development of a pro se
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">handbook</ENAMEX>, revision of administrative appeal notices, and expansion
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> facilitator system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> are in the process
of reorganization and consolidation into a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, with
the objective of establishing inclusion/diversity/multi-cultural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">competency</ENAMEX> as key justice system imperatives.

Among the accomplishments of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s planning
include:


•
A highly integrated configuration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, featuring
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> statewide programs, one federally funded and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> non-federally
funded, and a complementary system of local volunteer lawyers
programs, specialty legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>, law school clinical
programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouse facilitator</ENAMEX>, domestic violence advocacy
programs and many others.


•
The design and successful implementation of the CLEAR
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intake</ENAMEX>, advice, brief services, and referral system, which provides
telephone services for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> as well as a variety of
community legal education materials in hard copy and through its
website.


•
A system of closely coordinated advocacy among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>,
featuring statewide substantive task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>; inter-organizational
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that address substantive issues affecting large numbers of
low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>; co-counseling across programs; and dedication
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Legal Services</ENAMEX> to statewide advocacy
coordination.


•
A deep commitment by the private bar to provide equal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> to low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> reflected in the provision of pro
bono representation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 35,000</NUMEX> cases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.


•
A statewide system of training.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institution</ENAMEX> of a system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Law Facilitators</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>; development of a core curriculum for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">judiciary</ENAMEX> on
access to justice, including dealing with pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX>; and
other joint initiatives among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, and legal
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to expand access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>.


•
The development and implementation of a system-wide
technology plan with compatible <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> for case management
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>; hardware and software standards for the civil equal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX>; intake, timekeeping and system integration;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">networked</ENAMEX> computers; the capacity to ensure coordination of
technology efforts throughout the delivery system; computer and
software technology to support case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handlers</ENAMEX> at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> statewide
programs, pro bono services, and specialty legal services
providers; linked websites with community legal education
materials, selfhelp materials and forms, and instructions for
accessing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>; and systems for technology training and
support.


•
A shift in the equal justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, from a culture
characterized by a group of separate, independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> that
work effectively together in a coordinated effort to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> perceive themselves as a cohesive, comprehensive,
integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>.


•
A dedication to inclusion/diversity/multi-cultural
competency which manifests itself in effort to seek out and nurture
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> so that the system will not only survive


<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> succession, but will continue to adhere to the core
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> and values embedded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in ways that ensure the
highest degree of relevancy to the increasingly diverse communities
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in need of equal justice services.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>

-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>

Planning efforts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> have been coordinated through
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Symposium</ENAMEX>, originally created by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar and Bar Foundation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symposium</ENAMEX>, while not
yet a formalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, is a broad working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that has included
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court of Appeals</ENAMEX>,
several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal District Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX>,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX>. Other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symposium</ENAMEX> and its numerous standing committees
include legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> and program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and other
government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of</ENAMEX>
Law, bar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the domestic violence and
human services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symposium</ENAMEX> has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> for
debate and discussion of a wide range of equal justice issues, from
the mission of the civil legal assistance delivery system to the
design and implementation of a number of specific initiatives aimed
at unifying, expanding and improving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s equal justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symposium</ENAMEX> has also been the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> that has helped enable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> to unify and transform its delivery system. While
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> LSC programs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> will operate
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> statewide LSC program beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2002</TIMEX>. The first
mergers occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> subsequent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funding cuts, when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smallest LSC</ENAMEX> program, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Central West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX>
merged with the largest program <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Plan</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four years later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appalachian Research and Defense Fund</ENAMEX> merged
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society of Charleston</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of 2000</TIMEX> to
create <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appalachian Legal Services</ENAMEX>. Renewed planning efforts and a
commitment to build statewide core functions and capacities led to
the final planned merger between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appalachian Legal Services</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Virginia Legal Services Plan</ENAMEX>.
Planning and organizing for this final merger has been
extensive, and a merger website at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wvlegalservicesmerger</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>
helps facilitate the process.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symposium</ENAMEX> organized and launched a new,
unrestricted legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain State Justice</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. This non-LSC funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> is available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> throughout
the state and currently consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> full and part-time staff
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>. Funding for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX>,
private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> fees, and donations.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of Law</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s only law school,
is playing an increasingly important role in the development of
statewide technology and support systems. The development of a
statewide legal services website, based at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of Law</ENAMEX>, is currently underway. The interactive site will
include pro bono resources and community legal education materials
as well as provider information and support resources. It will be
part of a coordinated web information delivery strategy involving
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and broad range of non-traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Symposium's Intake, Access, Delivery, Self-Help and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention Committee</ENAMEX> is developing ways to improve system
integration and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> access, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of a statewide
telephonic intake, advice and referral system. They are
coordinating their efforts with pro se and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> education
information systems. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Futures Commission</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judiciary</ENAMEX> recently recommended that a pro se <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> be located
at each county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX>.
Through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Coordination</ENAMEX> and Collaboration with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Private Bar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symposium</ENAMEX> has sponsored a number of efforts to
expand private bar involvement including better recruitment,
training, and support for private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> willing to participate
in the delivery of civil legal services to low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. In
concert with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symposium</ENAMEX> will launch
a permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pro Bono Review Committee</ENAMEX> to facilitate the provision
of services by volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, the state domestic violence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> received a VAWA
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grant</ENAMEX> to set up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> new local pro bono programs in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
communities where there are domestic violence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelters</ENAMEX>. Pro bono
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> legal assistance at the final domestic
violence protective order hearing. As a result, significant new
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> resources have been developed in these communities
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> representation has dramatically increased.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statewide Technology Committee</ENAMEX> is standardizing all systems,
and a statewide technology plan for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is set to be
completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early June</TIMEX>.
The key challenge facing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is finding a way
to increase funding in order to significantly expand the capacity
for services. In addition to establishing a single statewide
coordinated fund raising plan, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symposium</ENAMEX> is exploring
legislative proposals involving fee-shifting statutes, as well as
more traditional approaches, such as filing fees, surcharges, or an
increase in bar dues.
The delivery of legal services in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> will soon be
enhanced by a statewide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.6 million TANF</NUMEX> grant. By far the largest
increase in resources in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, these funds will allow the
hiring of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> paralegals to provide service to TANF
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> on a wide array of legal problems that can obstacles be
to making a transition from welfare to work. The addition of this
staff will increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s legal service's advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> by
over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX>.

Although there is no single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> for success, many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that
are building state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> share similar
characteristics that can guide other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> less far along.
Particular models, strategies, and approaches that have proven
successful in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> may be useful to others, while the progress
of the national initiative to build state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> as it
has played out across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> provides some valuable
information for national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. The following
identifies some of the lessons that can be gleaned from observing
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that have made significant progress toward building state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> and attaining the goal of equal justice.
Included also are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and initiatives that have proven
successful or hold out the promise of success.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Broad Lessons</ENAMEX>


•
There is no single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> for building a state justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> that are on the road to success have taken a
variety of different approaches, based on particular circumstances,
challenges, and opportunities.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> within a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> must feel the need to and some
urgency for changing the legal services delivery system. Change is
difficult and time consuming; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not willingly make dramatic
changes in the way they go about their business unless and until
they feel that the situation demands it. Similarly, legal services
delivery systems will not change until they come to recognize that
access, quality, expansion of resources, promotion of diversity,
bi-partisan support and public acceptance are issues that must be
addressed. The goal is to light a fire without burning down the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tent</ENAMEX>. We can be proud of what we have accomplished over the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> while still understanding that we need to do more and
better.


•
Building and maintaining a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX> is an
ongoing process. The fact that it is a process means that somebody
has made a decision about the direction the process should take,
and it implies some ability to predict the outcome of the process
through implementation of strategies designed to accomplish the
desired objective. It also requires continuous dedication and
effort on the part of all those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the
state committed to equal justice. Even the few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that have
succeeded in building a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX> that has significantly
expanded and improved services for low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have not
achieved the ultimate goal of realizing equal justice for
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.


•
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> grounding in shared values and a shared vision
will increase the likelihood of success. Most successful efforts to
build a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX> have begun with a process to identify the
values that will inform planning efforts and provide the basis for
a shared vision of what the process is intended to achieve. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shared</ENAMEX>
values and vision impel the ongoing investment of time and energy
that is necessary for success and have enabled processes in a
number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to get past areas of disagreement. Values and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> paint the picture that drives the action.


•
Planning initiatives must be based upon a structured and
principled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client communities</ENAMEX>. A key
task of the planning process is to identify the major legal and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX>-system-related issues confronting low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in the state and to develop the best possible methods
and mechanisms to address them. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have used a thorough
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> needs study or report as a basis for their planning efforts.
Involving a broad-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> in the design,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">supervision</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of the study or report has helped to
ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> are fully invested in its findings and the
implementation of proposed solutions. In different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, the
study or report has been initiated or overseen variously by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>, the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar association</ENAMEX>, or an
officially chartered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> or similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leadership</ENAMEX> is key. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that have made progress
toward building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> have all had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> willing
and able to see the need for change, unafraid of taking a statewide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, eager to put the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> first, to accept
responsibility for meeting those needs, and to "keep their eyes on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prize</ENAMEX>," that is on the core values and vision on which the
process and its initiatives are based. Moreover, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have
successfully defined a series of goals and objectives that are
founded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s belief in equal access to justice and
they have been adept at communicating their goals to
others.


•
Planning and implementation require staffing and support.
Planning processes are complicated. Ongoing coordination and
support for them are essential. Permanent change will occur within
and among our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state communities</ENAMEX> of justice only if participating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> adopt new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and approaches that can cope
with a growing demand for flexibility and diverse high quality
legal services.


•
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have found that involving an experienced
planning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> in the initial phases of launching a process
and developing a plan can be valuable, particularly where difficult
issues involving institutional relationships are present. Central
coordination and support of an ongoing planning process and
implementation of its various initiatives can be provided by
"access to justice" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at the state bar or bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX>, IOLTA
staff, legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX> support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> working
directly for a statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX>.



•
Building a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX> is demanding and
involves real costs. The planning processes under way across the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> have required a tremendous expenditure of time and energy,
as well as actual out-of-pocket costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, planning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX>, and other expenses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has been able to provide some
financial support for these activities, but because of our limited
discretionary spending, our capacity to contribute is limited. All
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> that make up state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> must
understand and accept the need for an ongoing commitment to
contribute their time and energy to these efforts and that those
with funding capacity must bear a share of the costs. This
investment, while significant, will be far outweighed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pay-off</ENAMEX> in terms of increased access and expanded services
for

low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the intangible benefit that realizing the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> of equal justice for all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>.


•
If a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is going to successfully create a state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX>, someone has to be responsible for it. In other
words, state planning can not be left to take care of itself.
Someone (an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>) must advocate
for change, must be willing to do the work necessary to secure the
change, and must be committed to doing what it takes to make the
change permanent.


•
The creation of state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> will be
successful only if there is encouragement and legitimization of
constructive dissatisfaction. On-going evaluation of progress is
important. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Openness</ENAMEX>, candor and frank feedback are
essential.


•
State planning will fail unless there is acceptance of
and encouragement for the risks inherent in experimentation and
innovation. Innovation in processes, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and approaches must
be encouraged--even when they don't work out. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> should be
encouraged to explore innovative, creative or experimental
approaches to the delivery of legal services.


•
The successful state planning initiative requires open
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>. Planning that results in permanent change will occur
most readily and effectively where collaboration and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> building
is rewarded and infighting and/or turf-protecting activities are
shunned. And no one can be cut out of the process. State planning
fails when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of stakeholders feel ignored, marginalized or
unimportant.


•
Obstacles and setbacks must be anticipated. Changing a
delivery system that has been in place for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a quarter of a century</TIMEX>
is difficult. It will take longer than you anticipate. Skeptics
will try to derail it. There will be failures along the way, and
the personal costs for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX> cannot be overestimated.
Don't expect the path forward to be smooth but don't let the
obstacles overwhelm you.


•
In the end a state planning initiative takes time, a
commitment to forego issues of turf and personal interests, and a
supportive reward system. The creation of state justice communities
does not happen overnight, and it does not happen without some
personal pain (long-time legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> have seen their jobs
change in front of their eyes). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> must create ways to
honor its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>, record and reward its progress.
