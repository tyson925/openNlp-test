(held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 31 and June 1</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>)




OVERVIEW
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 31 and June 1, 2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> fifty equal justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> gathered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLADA</ENAMEX>'s first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> conference on diversity in the legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
Focusing on broad aspects of diversity - including, among others,
age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity and
national origin - <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> examined diversity-related strengths
and challenges facing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> (both
local and national), and brainstormed about potential strategies
for addressing the challenges. To ensure that the dialogue would
include the variety of issues and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the legal services
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLADA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to reflect both the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the field. To the maximum
extent possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> broadly mirrored the full population
of the national <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Attendance at the meeting was limited to
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to foster candid conversation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karp Consulting Group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Howard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yvonne Shinhoster Lamb</ENAMEX>)
facilitated the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> session.
All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> understood that, while the assembled group
reflected the demographics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, they did not speak for
every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the broad-based legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. It should
be noted also that no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> were involved in this event. Thus the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> and strategies suggested here must be seen and considered in
the context of a series of dialogues on diversity that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLADA</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> are holding throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and in the context of the
reports issued following those conversations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> began the conference by setting goals. They
included the following:


•
Identify and prioritize diversity-related issues that
exist within the legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.


•
Identify key diversity-related challenges that exist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">internally</ENAMEX> and externally.


•
Identify obstacles within our legal services community
that cause and/or perpetuate bias, oppression, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unfairness</ENAMEX>.


•
Brainstorm strategies to address the identified issues,
overcome the challenges and obstacles, and to promote justice,
fairness, and inclusion.


In order to facilitate the ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> to work
from an agreed upon set of facts about themselves, the facilitators
divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> represented a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in the history of legal services -- The Past (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX>),
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Present and The Future</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years from now</TIMEX>). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was then
asked to answer the same set of questions about their particular
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">era</ENAMEX>. The thoughts and observations of each group are reported
below.
The Past


•
Key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and community-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar associations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, other funders (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way</ENAMEX>) and policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLADA</ENAMEX>.


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client community</ENAMEX> included a high number of welfare
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>, was majority white and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> with some regional
differences and included some undocumented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>,
non-working poor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>.


•
Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was less diverse. Fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> worked in
legal services, particularly as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Management</ENAMEX> then was almost
exclusively white, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>, younger and inexperienced. There were
fewer indigenous staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.


•
Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff members</ENAMEX> were treated with a "sink or swim"
attitude. Although they were expected to handle large caseloads
almost immediately, they were also freer to pursue an issue area
and develop themselves professionally through that pursuit. Program
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> believed that poverty could be eradicated and accordingly
staff energies were often focused on impact work rather than on
access. Legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> were centered on the
eradication of poverty and promoting equality and justice and
independence.


•
Although there was concern about diversity, there was
neither real dedication to making it happen nor any real
accountability with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception -- the importance of hiring
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> and having <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African American</ENAMEX>
representation on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African American</ENAMEX>
populations resided. Other than that, little attention was given to
retaining and promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of color, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disabilities</ENAMEX> and others who reflected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client community</ENAMEX>.
However, there was an awareness of the need to hire nonlegal staff
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> being served and this meant that staff
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforces</ENAMEX> often consisted of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>, white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> and female
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraprofessional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>.


•
Some litigation was discrimination-based, i.e., school
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">desegregation</ENAMEX> and voting rights cases.


•
Staff training was usually not a priority for individual
programs and was generally provided by state and national back-up
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>.


•
Some national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> recognized the need for
greater gender diversity and pursued activities to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> into
the legal services workforce.


The Present


•
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> include governing and policy
boards and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> (those being served and those not being served).
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar associations</ENAMEX>,
court systems, new funders (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX>, state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Violence Against Women</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>) "old" funders (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Way</ENAMEX>), state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, social and human services
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, and civil rights and other advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of</TIMEX>
which did not exist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX>).


•
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client community</ENAMEX> has changed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>, senior citizens
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working poor</ENAMEX> still need our services, but new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have
emerged. Programs are now expected to serve gay, lesbian and
transgendered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, homeless
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> (many of whom do not speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and have
complex problems), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with disabilities, unemployed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of color, rural and urban low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from
depressed areas, and those with mental illness.


•
Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> include more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with disabilities,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, gay, lesbian and
transgendered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of color, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from diverse
economic backgrounds, and single and married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. These staff
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> tend to embrace the belief that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who needs a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> should have one, and that this is critical to moving people
out of poverty. However, although motivated by the desire to serve
and empower all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with legal problems, programs pragmatically
recognize the need to prioritize and focus their legal work on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>'s most serious problems.


•
The Present values include a commitment to quality work
and respect for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.


•
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s programs emphasize such activities as training
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLE</ENAMEX> opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, mentoring, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> building and
strategic planning. Programs are exploring flexible work schedules,
incentive awards, higher salaries and loan forgiveness initiatives.
Staff are encouraged to be active in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and in bar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> activities.


•
Many programs hold diversity training sessions for staff
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recruitment</ENAMEX> and retention efforts often reflect the
importance of a diverse workplace and the commitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and
staff to this value. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Client communities</ENAMEX> are more diverse and
programs have more bilingual staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Offices</ENAMEX> are more
accessible to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with disabilities in part because of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Disabilities Act</ENAMEX>. In some programs, management
structures have become broader to accommodate new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> and
approaches. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> have shown themselves willing to address
uncomfortable issues, give up power and make difficult financial
commitments to achieve a diverse work environment. Nonetheless,
serious diversity challenges continue to affect our
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.


•
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in the Present is translating the national
dialogue on diversity to local action. How can programs strengthen
their efforts to hire and retain a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> as well as develop
diverse leadership? How do we encourage programs to hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with disabilities, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonmajority</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>? How do we create opportunities for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (and younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>) to advance? How do we
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">engage Boards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> in these efforts?


•
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s diversity approaches stress inclusion of people
of color, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with disabilities, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX>, older people
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. In the Present we recognize that barriers are not
excuses. We realize that diversity can help programs reach clients
in a more appropriate and useful way, and we recognize the need to
increase staff communication skills including fluency in languages
other than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>. We acknowledge that sharing power is often key
to achieving diversity in program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>.


The Future


•
Key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> will include older and aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client population</ENAMEX> will be multinational due to the continuing
influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>. There will be more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and
employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> along with those with mental health
needs.


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> will expand, enhanced by the
growth of state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> and the many stakeholders
engaged in state planning. The importance and impact of non-LSC
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">funders</ENAMEX> will increase.


•
Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> will reflect the community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and
include more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> languages and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> or firstgeneration <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. We will employ
more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and those embarking on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> careers. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> will reflect the expanded diversity
in the general program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.


•
There will be a greater emphasis on technology skills.
Office schedules will be more flexible (to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>) and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-traditional</ENAMEX> (to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>). Programs will gain higher
visibility in multicultural communities.


•
The legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX> will expand its hiring,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retention</ENAMEX> and training activities in the multicultural community.
Innovative loan forgiveness programs will attract diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. It
will nurture a cadre of multiculturally competent and innovative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. Diversity will be reflected in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s everyday
culture. Partnerships with non-traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> will grow
and new definitions of diversity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> will be crafted. We
will pursue affirmative


challenges to institutional oppression and disparate treatment.
We will concern ourselves with the clash between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as a result
of changing demographics, and with the clash between "the law" and
our vision for inclusion as a justice imperative.


THE NEED FOR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A DIVERSE WORKFORCE WITHIN THE LEGAL SERVICES</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMMUNITY</ENAMEX>
Turning to the importance of diversity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> agreed that
giving diversity concerns their time, energy, attention and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> will generate big dividends. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> agreed that a
diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> creates a better product and strengthens client trust
in the program. They felt that a diverse environment fosters
personal growth and leads to an appreciation of differences in
others. Diversity allows us to tap into human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>, inspiration
and excitement. It makes us aware of the special needs of
disenfranchised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. It empowers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, strengthens
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and improves ties to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> also agreed that a highly diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> is
not achieved without certain difficulties. Diversity "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX>"
often feel the fatigue and isolation of being the only or among a
few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of color, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with disabilities, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> or
other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Proponents</ENAMEX> of increased diversity may face criticism from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> for "spending too much time on diversity." Since legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> often think of themselves as "progressives" who
don't need further education on issues of inclusion, making
diversity work within programs is not easy and requires the support
and the guidance of committed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. Helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and boards
arrive at a common vision necessitates honest and sometimes
difficult conversations.
All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> agreed on the following:


•
Turning words into action requires establishing goals and
setting realistic timeframes and benchmarks (without setting an end
date);


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> is easier to obtain if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not made
defensive;


•
Framing diversity efforts in positive and practical terms
will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> to move beyond the "moral imperative"
approach;


•
Budgets and other resources must be revised to support
the new effort;


•
Policies will need to be strengthened to accommodate more
aggressive and urgent strategies.


Building and retaining a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> is a major
challenge for most programs. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> believe that increasing
salaries and benefits and developing loan forgiveness programs will
go a long way to attracting a more diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Seeing
opportunities for advancement and leadership positions in programs
is critical to retaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of color and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who contribute to a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. An active and
authentic commitment to diversity throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX> program is
essential. A core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> can begin the work, but structural and
programmatic changes -- mentoring, opportunities to talk about real
problems and see solutions implemented, power sharing, diverse
boards of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX>, new definitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> --will be
necessary to achieve lasting change. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> agreed that a
program's belief in the value of diversity is best shown by the
extent to which it devotes time, money and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to achieving
it.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRITICAL ISSUES</ENAMEX>
After identifying the benefits and challenges of focusing on
diversity and developing strategies to maximize the benefits and
overcome the challenges, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> identified internal and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">external</ENAMEX> issues that they wanted to spend more time discussing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX> issues selected for further discussion included the
following:


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recruitment</ENAMEX> and retention of diverse
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">leadership/governance</ENAMEX>


•
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recruitment</ENAMEX> and retention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>



•
Perception that programs have withdrawn from
discrimination-based advocacy

The top external issues included:


•
Lack of a common definition/vision of
diversity


•
Loss of trust among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> because of perception
that programs are no longer dealing with discrimination-based
issues (and resulting tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-Americans</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX>)


•
Making justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> more diverse, inclusive and
multiculturally competent


•
Creating organizational cultures to address a broader
range of legal issues than we do now1


<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conferees</ENAMEX> agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> is broader than just
"management" and that the concept of leadership rests on power
sharing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conferees</ENAMEX> further noted that possibilities for promotion
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of "disenfranchised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>" must be in
place to ensure that "diversity" goes beyond race. Additionally,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women managers</ENAMEX> and minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> cannot be held to unreasonable
expectations and higher standards than those applied to
heterosexual white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conferees</ENAMEX> believe that programmatic growth rests on a common
definition and vision of diversity and earmarking resources so that
goals are attained. Programs need to come up with innovative ways
of supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> for diversity, including
charging certain staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to "reach out" to others to overcome
possibly hidden discrimination (such as discrimination <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays/lesbians</ENAMEX>/bi-sexual and transgender
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">persons</ENAMEX>). Sensitivity to differences must be constantly encouraged.
We should be particularly careful not to refer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> elsewhere
merely because their issues or situations are unpopular. Programs
should consider reengaging in discrimination-based advocacy if that
approach has been abandoned or overlooked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> gave issues <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX> the same number of votes, tying
them for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> place.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Conferees</ENAMEX> found that programs lacked a common definition and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> of diversity. Some felt that there had been loss of trust by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> from "disenfranchised" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> because of a belief that
legal services programs have pulled away from discrimination-based
initiatives. With respect to challenges at the local level,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> discussed the need for programs to create cultures that
address more complex issues (for example, mental health and race
issues). On a broader level, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> agreed that we must work to
ensure that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> and the
broader national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> becomes more diverse, inclusive and
multiculturally competent. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> agreed that in order to
identify and serve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that remain isolated, we need to broaden
our language bases, bring more qualified support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to our
programs, use community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and be sensitive to tension between
disenfranchised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VISION FOR SUCCESS</ENAMEX>
After prioritizing their primary issues, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conferees</ENAMEX> then listed
indicators by which success in achieving diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> could be defined. Indicators are grouped by topic and
summarized by theme.
Leadership
Indicators of success -- Our senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> includes more
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lesbians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of color, older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and people
with disabilities. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leaders</ENAMEX> are held accountable for progress in
meeting goals that ensure our programs and state justice
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> are diverse throughout, maintaining a "glittering
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosaic</ENAMEX>." From novel power-sharing arrangements, new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership models</ENAMEX> emerge. Local and national initiatives are
established to nurture and promote them.
Program Boards
Indicators of success --Boards contain representatives from a
greater variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>, state and local program boards
reflect the diversity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> they serve.
State <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Communities</ENAMEX>
Indicators of success --We endorse a common vision of diversity
and goal for achievement on the national, state and local levels,
and diversity issues are included in every state plan. Effective
policies that implement diversity goals are adopted throughout each
state. Our goals and related efforts as contained in state plans
are based on a deeper understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> demographics
published in the new census material. We have crafted innovative
strategies for reaching severely marginalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and our
statistics show that they are working. Program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and
stakeholders are engaged in a full range of client services,
address a full-range of legal problems, and have assumed the
responsibility to create greater access and capacity to solve
them.
Programs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Staff</ENAMEX>
Indicators of success -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salaries</ENAMEX> and compensation packages are
competitive with other nonprofit and public interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
Funding allocations reflect the high priority that programs place
on aggressive discrimination-based advocacy and attaining diversity
goals. Programs offer a broader range of services to the community
based on an expanded definition of advocacy, moving beyond
litigation and conventional lawyering.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Funders</ENAMEX>
Indicators of success -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Money</ENAMEX> is available to implement
innovative diversity agendas and model projects.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTION PLANNING</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> drew up an action-plan that could bring about their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> and in the context of what they anticipate the future will
hold in terms of issues, funding and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Their ideas and
initiatives can be implemented at the local and national
levels.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recruitment and Retention of Diverse Leadership/Governance</ENAMEX>
Steps are initiated to allow program board membership to reflect
the clienteligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> from the
funding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> is
required to have a standing committee to monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and program
diversity. A national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leadership institute</ENAMEX> is created and begins to
identify, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> and otherwise train diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>; its
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> from each program; it is
adequately funded. Compensation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in legal services
programs anticipate long-term tenure and include pension plans,
flexible schedules and benefits that reward longevity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recruitment and Retention of Minorities</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on retention and recruitment over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> is
gathered and made available by national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>; these groups
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">compile</ENAMEX> and disseminate information on successful diversity
initiatives. Programs begin to conduct exit interviews that seek to
understand the reasons for staff turnover. Programs begin to
establish formal mentoring systems for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Personnel</ENAMEX> policies
will be revised so that they further encourage and support a
diverse work environment and spell out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s
commitment to diversity. On the local and national levels,
opportunities for professional development will grow and all staff
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in a program, not just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>, take advantage of
them.
Encouraging Discrimination-Based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advocacy</ENAMEX>
Discrimination-based advocacy is incorporated in advocate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orientation</ENAMEX> and training sessions. It also becomes a focus at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> training events. State planning addresses
discrimination-based advocacy and the infrastructure necessary to
achieve it. Programs and state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> seek guidance on
the intersection of race and poverty from national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> and
focus on these issues in local, regional and state contexts.
Programs develop more opportunities for staff to understand the
discriminatory impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> that can result from public
policies. They hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to act as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> in this arena. Training strategies highlight the
centrality of discrimination-based advocacy to our mission.
Developing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Definition</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision of Diversity</ENAMEX>
A common definition of diversity is developed. It is informed by
federal and state law, census data and innovative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> from other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disciplines</ENAMEX> while acknowledging the breadth of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. It
incorporates concepts of power and reduction of barriers and an
affirmative duty to address barriers. Program and justice community
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> is tied to and evaluated in terms of diversity initiatives.
All programs commit to addressing internal diversity concerns.
Addressing "Loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trust</ENAMEX>" Due to Perception that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Programs Are</ENAMEX>
No Longer Dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Discrimination</ENAMEX>-Based Issues
State <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice communities</ENAMEX> begin to examine how they set
priorities given changing demographics (census), new technology,
emerging legal needs, commonalties among diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, and
severely marginalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client populations</ENAMEX> living within in our
service areas. Programs create staff positions charged with working
with special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client populations</ENAMEX>. Programs and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> members
are encouraged to collaborate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and apply bold
strategies in addressing community problems. State justice
communities examine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> within a multicultural framework and
use the results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> training. They become more
creative in raising funds for discrimination-based projects.
Ensuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Justice Communities Become Diverse, Inclusive</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Multiculturally Competent and Creating Cultures that Impact a</ENAMEX>
Broader Range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX> Issues than <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We Do Now</ENAMEX> (i.e., mental health
and racial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX>)
National <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> publicly affirm that a hallmark of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice community</ENAMEX> is that it is diverse, inclusive, and
multiculturally competent. A "best practices" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clearinghouse</ENAMEX> is
developed where programs share ideas on diversity successes. There
are regular diversity conferences for state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> community
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>.
