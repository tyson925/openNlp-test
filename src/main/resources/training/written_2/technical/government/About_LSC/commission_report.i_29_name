<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corporation</ENAMEX> is a private, nonmembership,
nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> of the Corporation is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> voting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who
are appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> with the advice
and consent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. By law, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> is bipartisan: no more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> can be of the same political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erlenborn Commission</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erlenborn Commission</ENAMEX> was authorized by
a resolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 1998</TIMEX>, to study the presence requirement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s
statutory restriction on the representation of eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s appropriations act and its regulation
on the representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> have required that an alien be
"present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" to be eligible for legal assistance
from an LSC grantee. Neither the appropriations act nor the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s regulations define the term "present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> solicited written comments from the public
and held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> public hearings duly noticed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Report</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> is based on a thorough analysis of the
applicable statutory provisions, the extensive record compiled from
the comments and testimony regarding the circumstances under which
representation of eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> occurs and the practices of legal
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> relating to eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>.
Scope of alien representation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Corporation grantees</ENAMEX> are
permitted to represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, including lawful
permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> granted asylum, and temporary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> admitted under the "H-2A" program. With the
sole exception of H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees may provide
representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> on the same subjects as is provided to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. (The report refers to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> as "unrestricted
categories.") The representation of H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, however, is
limited to "matters which arise under the provisions of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worker</ENAMEX>'s specific employment contract" in the areas of wages,
housing, transportation and other employment rights under the
contract. The "present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" requirement applies to
both the unrestricted categories and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.
Of particular interest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> was the situation of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, a category that includes both aliens
from the unrestricted categories (such as permanent resident
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliens</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seasonal</TIMEX> agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> frequently
leave and re-enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>; thus the "presence"
requirement would have a substantial and direct impact on their
ability to receive legal representation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees.
The record reveals that it has been a long-standing practice for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees to provide legal assistance to eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who
have left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> at some point during representation.
This practice has been followed without objection from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX> when conducting audits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees, or from
agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> involved in legal
disputes. In addition, there has been no formal regulation or
opinion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General Counsel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> regarding the specific
scope of the presence requirement. A recent complaint to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX> about the activities of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-grantee</ENAMEX> relating to alien
representation raised the issue presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statutory Analysis.</ENAMEX> Applying the principles of law governing
statutory analysis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> considered the presence
requirement in light of its plain and ordinary meaning, its context
in a statutory scheme and the purpose and design of the statute as
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a whole</TIMEX>. See Part III(A). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s appropriations act
requires that an alien must be "present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" in
order to be eligible for legal assistance. Construing the term
"present" according to its ordinary meaning, it is clear that the
statute requires the alien to be physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> at some point. This conclusion does not end the inquiry,
however, because the relevant question is not whether an alien must
be physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, but when the alien must
be present in order to be entitled to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> representation. Here, the
language provides no express statement on when an alien must be
present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Indeed, no single interpretation is
clearly compelled by the statutory language. For example, nothing
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> authorization language keys representation to when the
cause of action arises or specifically requires that the alien be
present when the representation commences. In particular, the
statute does not expressly require that an alien be continuously
physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> throughout the period of
representation in order to be eligible for legal assistance.
The factual record and the statutory scheme in which the
language arises, on the other hand, provide an important context
for consideration of the legal question of when an alien must be
"present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>." Consideration of the immediate
context in which the language appears raises further questions
regarding the meaning of the presence requirement. The statute's
application of the presence requirement to legal permanent
residents, for example, is in some tension with the fact that those
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> are legally entitled to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> temporarily
without affecting their immigration status. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Part II</ENAMEX>(C)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>).
Furthermore, H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> by definition are physically present in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> only temporarily. Reading "presence" in the
statute to require uninterrupted, continuous physical presence
would mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, without using such language, intended to
deny LSC representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who engaged in
federally-authorized travel that did not affect their immigration
status. In the case of H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, the reading would require the
conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to provide H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> with
legal services representation on claims arising from their
employment contracts only for the very brief periods that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> -- potentially rendering the
promise of legal representation largely meaningless. In short, an
examination of the language of the presence requirement and the
statutory context in which it arises raises a number of
interpretive problems and fails to resolve the question of when an
alien must be present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in order to be entitled
to legal services representation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> concludes that the
statutory language is ambiguous on this point. These difficulties
support further inquiry into relevant legislative history to help
determine the meaning of the presence requirement.
Legislative History. The legislative history of the presence
requirement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s appropriations and the applicable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> provisions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Immigration Reform and Control Act</ENAMEX> confirm
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to provide meaningful representation to
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> on claims arising from
their employment contract; and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> did not understand the
presence requirement to severely alter or restrict this
representation. See Part III(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> Act was adopted
to provide effective legal representation to low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>.
The presence language appeared in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> appropriations act as
part of an effort to expand LSC representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> other than
lawful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, and does not appear to have been intended to
limit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who were continuously physically
present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Similarly, the express purpose of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 305</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRCA</ENAMEX> was to "secure the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-2</ENAMEX> agricultural
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> under the specific contract under which they were admitted
to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>." Such representation was intended to prevent the
exploitation of foreign H2A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and to ensure that the wages
and working conditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> would not be undermined.
Findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fact and Application of Law</ENAMEX>. The record compiled by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> supports, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">inter alia</ENAMEX>, the following findings of
fact. See Part II. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Aliens</ENAMEX> in the unrestricted categories often
legally leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> during the course of their
representation. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Part II</ENAMEX>(C)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>). Most H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> for brief periods of time and do not seek legal
representation until they have completed their contract, often
because of fear of retaliation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Part II</ENAMEX> (C)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
and (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>). Most claims made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to resolve. See
Part <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>). Requiring legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to monitor their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>' movements and formally withdraw whenever the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> leaves
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> would create extraordinary burdens for the LSC
grantees, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. See Part
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). Finally, the private bar and other nonprofit legal services
providers are neither available, willing, nor able to take over the
representation of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Part II</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>).
This factual record provided an important context for
consideration of the legal question of the meaning of the presence
requirement. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> possible interpretations of the presence
language were listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> notice:
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an alien must be physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> when
the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal
assistance arises; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) an alien must be physically present only
when legal representation is commenced; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) an alien must be
physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> any time the alien is
provided legal assistance from an LSC grantee. Upon careful
consideration of the findings of fact, the language and purposes of
the statute and the legislative history, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> has
determined that none of these formulations fully responds to the
purposes of the statute or the intent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, the
record demonstrates that the interpretations initially offered by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> notice would contradict
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' clear purpose of providing meaningful legal
representation to indigent lawful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> and lead to absurd
results. See Part III(C).
For example, as applied to the unrestricted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, such
interpretations would preclude representation for permanent
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident aliens</ENAMEX> who are evicted from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> or against
whom divorce proceedings were commenced while the alien is legally
out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for brief periods to attend a family emergency
or funeral. These interpretations would also invite exploitation by
allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> to simply wait until an alien temporarily
departed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> before cutting off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> compensation
benefits, or initiating eviction, repossession, or divorce or
custody proceedings.
In regard to H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, the record demonstrates that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' purpose of providing meaningful representation to these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> cannot be accomplished under the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> interpretations in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX>. Many of the contract rights of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>--
such as reimbursement for return transportation, workers
compensation, the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/4</NUMEX> guarantee, and claims that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grower</ENAMEX> failed to
mail the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s final paycheck-- often do not arise until after
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> has returned home. In addition, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> is
required to be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> throughout the course of the
representation, the right to legal assistance would be lost
altogether. By law, H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> must leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> at the end
of their contract period and most such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two to five months</TIMEX>. The factual record before the
Commission demonstrates that the vast majority of the claims of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> cannot be completed while the alien is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> recognizes that representation of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> was a central element in the legislative
crafting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> program. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> concludes that this
reading of the statute would essentially bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> representation of
this class of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> and leave H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> without meaningful
representation on their employment contract claims, directly
contrary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' express purpose. We decline to sanction such
a result.
Conclusion. Together, the language, purpose, and legislative
history of the applicable statutes, and the factual record before
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>, suggest an interpretation of the statute that would
authorize the following representation:
For an alien in one of the unrestricted categories
representation would be authorized so long as the eligible alien is
present sufficient to maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> or lawful immigration
status. Under this interpretation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> who have begun
representation of a permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> alien may continue that
representation should the alien be temporarily outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. Grantees may also initiate representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> in the
unrestricted categories who are temporarily outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, provided that they have been present sufficient to maintain
and have not abandoned their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">INA</ENAMEX> status. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees
may not represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> in this category who have never entered or
been present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
For H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, representation is authorized if the workers
have been admitted to and have been present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
pursuant to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> contract, and the representation arises under
their H<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-2A</TIMEX> contract. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees are authorized to litigate this
narrow range of claims to completion, despite the fact that the
alien may be required to depart the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> prior to or
during the course of the representation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees may not
represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> in this category who have never entered or been
present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. INTRODUCTION</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erlenborn Commission</ENAMEX> was established to evaluate the scope
of permissible representation for eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s appropriations act and its regulation
on the representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> have required that an alien be
"present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" to be eligible for legal assistance
from an LSC grantee. Neither the appropriations act nor the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s regulations defines the term "present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corporation Board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Directors</ENAMEX> adopted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98-011</NUMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 16, 1998</TIMEX>, providing authority to
establish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> with the express purpose of studying the
presence requirement for the representation of eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees are permitted to represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> classes of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aliens</ENAMEX>, including lawful permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
granted asylum, and temporary agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> admitted under
the "H-2A" program.1 With the sole exception of H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, LSC
grantees may provide general representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> on all the

In crafting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> was acutely aware of the
vulnerability of temporary agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and of problems
that had arisen under other such programs, particularly the Bracero
Program. See discussion infra Part III(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> further
recognized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> provisions
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
required enforcement mechanisms lest they become mere paper

authorized LSC-funded representation for H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> on matters

The statutory protections set forth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> program, and the
provision of legal representation to H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to enforce these
rights, thus were intended to accomplish <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> purposes: to protect
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from exploitation, and to ensure that the
employment of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> would not depress the wages and working
conditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. These considerations explain why H-2A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are the only category of nonimmigrants eligible for
LSC-funded representation. They also point to the differences
between the representation authorized for the unrestricted
categories and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>: for the former, grantees may represent
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> on all matters; for the latter, representation is
restricted to matters arising under the employment contract.

Testimony identified particular issues regarding agricultural

enter the migrant stream and travel from state to state following
the growing and harvesting demands for various <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>. The low wages

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> has found that the timing of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/4</NUMEX> guarantee claims

still in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> particularly difficult. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO REPORT</ENAMEX> at

Where the prevailing wage required by federal law is disputed or
under administrative review, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s claim that the employer
failed to pay the prevailing wage may not arise until the worker
has returned home. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March Testimony</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">148</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob</ENAMEX>

provide them with a copy of the employment contract will be unaware

discovered until after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> returns home. See id. at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">146-47</NUMEX>.
Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are unlikely to discover that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> has

Ethnic and cultural differences, language barriers, and lack of

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unrestricted Aliens</ENAMEX>
Most of the comments and testimony provided to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
concerning time periods to resolve claims dealt with the
representation of agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, some of the
information in the record is relevant to non-agricultural worker
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> takes notice that representation of all
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> frequently continues for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX>. For
example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington State</ENAMEX>, wrongful discharge claims which
cannot be resolved informally may take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as one year</TIMEX> to
resolve at the administrative level and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as three years</TIMEX> if
litigation is required. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>, Exhibit 1
(testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Lara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). Sexual harassment
claims filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEOC</ENAMEX> similarly may require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> to eighteen
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> at the administrative level, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as three years</TIMEX> if a
case goes to trial. See id. Cases concerning education related
claims such as a challenge to the expulsion or suspension of a
student, or a denial of equal access claim can require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between one</NUMEX>
to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> in state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. See id. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> disability
claims can last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> at the administrative level in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
if the case goes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appeals Council</ENAMEX>. Housing matters similarly
may require a minimum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> to resolve informally, and as
long as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen months</TIMEX> for an unlawful eviction action in state
court, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> relating to a claim for public housing
eligibility. See id. Unemployment compensation claims in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
frequently require pursuing a preliminary administrative process to

The migratory and isolated nature of alien farmworker
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> makes them extremely difficult for private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to

(testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Lara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). Private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> are
unfamiliar with the location of rural labor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> and lack the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> and knowledge of farmworker migratory behavior necessary
to maintain contact with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. Farmworker cases are very
labor intensive - <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> generally cannot be accessed by phone or
fax, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> may not be able to communicate in writing, and
interviewing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> or obtaining or preparing documents may
require multiple visits in person to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s location. See

The barriers involved in representing alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmworkers</ENAMEX> are
compounded by the low compensation available in such cases. The low
level of farmworker wages results in damages awards that are
extremely low. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">49</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Londen</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). Fees on wage and hour cases, farm labor safety
cases, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> compensation cases are too low relative to
the time needed to resolve the case for most private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">litigate</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco J. Bricio</ENAMEX>,

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, even large labor rights cases are
difficult to refer to the private bar because of the unavailability
of contingency fees, the inadequacy of statutory fees, and the
difficulty involved in representing farmworker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">208</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Padilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia L. Rice</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>). Private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> are not
available to represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> administrative
proceedings, for which legal fees are not provided. See id.; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal</ENAMEX>
Assistance). It is extremely difficult to obtain alternative
representation for housing eviction, benefits, education, and
health access cases, whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> is an alien or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>.
See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">208</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Padilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia L.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>).
Alien farmworker representation is further compromised by the
lack of private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> in rural areas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, for example, has
several rural agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than five</NUMEX> practicing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> with no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> at all. See
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">187</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Monahan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Bar of Georgia</ENAMEX>). Private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> who engage
in the most pro bono work are located in large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> in major
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, far removed from farmworker locales. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">41-42</TIMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Londen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). The few
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> who do reside in locations where farmworkers are likely
to live and work generally represent agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> and are
conflicted out of representing farmworkers. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">174</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel G. Ford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Legal Services</ENAMEX>); <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>

in major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> located near farmworker areas, it is extremely
difficult to find pro bono lawyers able to represent farmworkers
because agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> are predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in those
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">42</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Londen</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> sugar industry, for example, retained
many of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> litigation. See
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March Testimony</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">144</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Williams</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorneys</ENAMEX> with expertise in employment matters, a common claim
of alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmworkers</ENAMEX>, also generally practice in urban areas far
from the farmworker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">81</NUMEX> (comment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn J. Endriss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Employment</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Association</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> in
employment law matters, reports that while its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have
expertise on employment law matters, very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>, other than
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, are willing to take on these cases because
of the complexity of farmworker legal claims, the time and
financial resources needed to litigate these cases, and the
practical problems of representing farmworkers. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments
at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">189</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet E. Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Employment Lawyers</ENAMEX>

Endriss, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> reports that pro bono programs,
operated through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono</ENAMEX>, typically do not
represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> for many of the reasons noted above. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">48</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doreen Dodson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA/SCLAID</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>
further notes that while the immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> is generous with its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and equipped to overcome some of the practical barriers in
representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> often do not have expertise to
deal with general civil matters. See id. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> further reports on
efforts it has made to expand pro bono services to the immigrant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. See id. at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>. These efforts have yet to result in
significant new pro bono resources and it is not expected that
private pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> will be able to meet a significant portion
of the demand for service. See id. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolina Bar Association</ENAMEX> reports that "there just are not enough
civil legal resources available from the private bar, paid or pro
bono, to ensure that migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> achieve even minimum access to
their basic human and contract rights." See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
(comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry B. Sitton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Carolina Bar Association</ENAMEX>). The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> available and the barriers to farmworker
representation make farmworker cases more difficult to place with
pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> than any other type of case, including death
penalty convictions. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jack</ENAMEX>
Londen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). Moreover, it would be impossible to find
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to handle emergency situations that arise for
eligible alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">97</NUMEX> (testimony of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Iwasaki</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>).
To the extent that private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> are willing to take cases

Finally, as with the representation of other alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmworkers</ENAMEX>,
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> typically do not have the language skills,

As in other alien cases, in H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> cases private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> have

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution
Mediation mechanisms alone, to the extent that these are
available to settle legal claims, will not necessarily resolve
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>' claims. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commentators</ENAMEX> recognize that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will often
refuse to participate in mediation if the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> to the
dispute lack the resources to litigate, and they question the
fairness of mediation if only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side is represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> or
if a disputant has difficulty negotiating effectively in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.

(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 ed.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>). The barriers to private bar representation
experienced by alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> are also applicable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADR</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>).
Further, mediation mechanisms may not be available to many
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>. Alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> may not have the financial means to
use these procedures. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">77</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark</ENAMEX>
Talamantes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>); <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">209</NUMEX> (comment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Padilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia L. Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal</ENAMEX>
Assistance). Pre-litigation mediation is almost always subject to
sharing of costs. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">209</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jose</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia L. Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>).
Court referred mediation is available after litigation is filed,
and often has a cost-sharing component. See id. Even if a party
agrees to pay the costs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX>, for example, in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, there are other costs which the alien must bear, such
as paying for interpreters and translation of documents. See id. In
some cases, the possibility of a mediated settlement does not forgo
the need to file litigation, conduct discovery or obtain pre-trial
orders. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">173</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daniel</ENAMEX>

(comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melissa A. Pershing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> has an effective mediation program, but pre-trial mediation
still requires representation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> and the availability of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> to pursue litigation should mediation fail. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">142</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D. Michael Dale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oregon Law Center</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janice Morgan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Services of Oregon</ENAMEX>). Mediation conducted
in bad faith by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> can delay resolution of the case. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">49</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco J. Bricio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at
Law).
Finally, as a practical matter in farmworker litigation,
agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> may choose not to use mediation programs.
See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28-31</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garry G. Geffert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Legal Services</ENAMEX> Plan). In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, the legal services
program, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Farm Bureau</ENAMEX>, the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University</ENAMEX> established a mediation program operating
out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65-66</NUMEX> (comment of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James F. Schmidt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmworker Legal Services</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>). In its
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> of operation not one agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> agreed to
use the procedures as an alternative to litigation. See id. at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>.
A similar program established in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> also proved
ineffective. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">31</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garry G.</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USDOL</ENAMEX> reports that despite high violation rates in agriculture,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">farmworkers</ENAMEX> generally do not file complaints with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USDOL</ENAMEX> due to

of the cases investigated were the result of a complaint from an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>. See id.
Moreover, government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have competing priorities and

Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> may also lack the legal authority to seek

absence by seeking a continuance is not a viable alternative to
formally withdrawing from the case. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> may not grant a
continuance, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiffs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> in the litigation
may object to suspending the proceedings. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>
(testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Lara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>). Absent a formal motion
to withdraw, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> of record in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> remains
responsible, both ethically and under the rules of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, for
responding to any matter that should arise. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at

If opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> filed a motion for summary judgment while a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> was out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> refused to grant a
continuance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> would be placed in the impossible
position of either taking the steps necessary to respond to the

what we could do if we found out that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> was outside the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Would we not answer a phone call, not respond to a
question, cancel a deposition, or not go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and

Requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to monitor the movements of eligible aliens
at all times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> would impose monumental burdens on LSC
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grantees</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-25</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Rice</ENAMEX>,

Alien farmworkers move frequently within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. It
would be extremely difficult for a legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to know whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>, who has been working in the
migrant stream in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, has temporarily crossed the border into
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-25</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Rice</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>). Requiring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> to contact
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> periodically is not technically feasible for many of
farmworker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>. See id. at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>. In border <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> where
aliens travel back and forth across the border on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis,
legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> would have to require their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> -- who
may be illiterate -- to keep a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> log to account for their
movements. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">109</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Coyle</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</ENAMEX>). The confusion
created by a such a requirement would be significant.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the
administrative burdens to resume representation would once again
have to be undertaken. This start-and-stop representation would be
confusing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> and would significantly undermine the
effectiveness of representation. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">209</NUMEX> (comment
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Padilla</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia L. Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal</ENAMEX>

the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, and administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">209</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s rights to representation would be lost in
certain administrative proceedings. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">209</NUMEX>

The rule would also invite abuse. Opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> and parties
could seek to compromise the alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s rights by delaying the

agrees to the representation with the knowledge that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attorney</ENAMEX>
must seek to withdraw under the rules, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> refuses to
grant the withdrawal motion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> would be required to
continue the representation. See id. at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">262</NUMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>
stated that, even where rules of professional responsibility would
not absolutely bar representation, the unavailability of substitute

produces an absurd, and perhaps unconstitutional, result. Our task
is to give some alternative meaning to the [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>] that avoids

Analyzed in light of these canons of interpretation, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation's</ENAMEX> appropriations act requires that an alien must be
"present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" in order to be eligible for legal
assistance<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX> Construing the term "present" according to its
ordinary meaning, it is clear that the statute requires the alien
to be
13
physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> at some point. This
conclusion does not end the inquiry, however, because the question
before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> is not whether an alien must be physically
present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, but when the alien must be present in
order to be entitled to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> representation. Here, the language
provides no express statement on when an alien must be present in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and other familiar terms of immigration law, such
as "continuous physical presence" are not used.
The factual record and the statutory scheme in which the
language arises, on the other hand, provide an important context
for consideration of the legal question of when an alien must be
"present in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> The statutory provision is implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX>'s
alien eligibility rule. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">45 C.F.R.</ENAMEX> pt. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1626</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>).
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> The term "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" is defined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INA</ENAMEX> and Part <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1626</TIMEX>
as "the continental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>,
Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>." See id
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ยง1626.2</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>); <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.ย</ENAMEX>ง <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1101</TIMEX>(a)(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">38</NUMEX>).
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>." As the Corporation has noted, the statutory
language may be read alternately to require that (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an alien must
be physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> when the cause of action
for which the recipient provides legal assistance arises; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) an
alien must be physically present only when legal representation is
commenced; or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) an alien must be physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> any time the alien is provided legal assistance from an LSC
grantee<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.14</NUMEX> No single interpretation, however, is clearly compelled
by the statutory language. For example, nothing in the LSC
authorization language keys representation to when the cause of
action arises or specifically requires that the alien be present
when the representation commences. In particular, the statute does
not expressly require that an alien be continuously physically
present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> throughout the period of
representation in order to be eligible for legal assistance.
Consideration of the immediate context in which the language
appears raises further questions regarding the meaning of the
presence requirement. The statute's application of the presence
requirement to legal permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, for example, is in some
tension with the fact that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> are legally entitled to
leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> temporarily without affecting their
immigration status. See discussion supra Part <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>(C)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>).
Furthermore, H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> by definition are physically present in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> only temporarily. Reading "presence" in the
statute to require uninterrupted, continuous physical presence
would mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, without using such language, intended to
deny LSC representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who engaged in
federally-authorized travel that did not affect their immigration
status. In the case of H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, the reading would require the
conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to provide H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> with
legal services representation on claims arising from their
employment contracts only for the very brief periods that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> -- potentially rendering the
promise of legal representation largely meaningless. These
difficulties support further inquiry into the meaning of the
presence requirement.
In short, an examination of the language of the presence
requirement and the statutory context in which it arises raises a
number of interpretive problems and fails to resolve the question
of when an alien must be present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in order to
be entitled to legal services representation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
concludes that the statutory language is ambiguous on this
point.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. Legislative History</ENAMEX>



<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Origins of the Presence Requirement
The legislative history provides assistance in analyzing the
presence requirement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LSC Act of 1974</ENAMEX>, as amended, was adopted
"to provide equal access to the system of justice in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Nation</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who seek redress of grievances; . . . to provide high
quality legal assistance to those who would otherwise be unable to
afford adequate legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>; . . . [and to] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provid</ENAMEX>[e] legal
assistance to those who face an economic barrier to adequate legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. ย</ENAMEX>ง <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2996</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LSC Act</ENAMEX> itself

includes no restrictions on the provision of legal assistance by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>. However, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
began restricting legal assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>
pursuant to provisos in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s appropriations acts.
Originally, these provisos permitted the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funds for legal
assistance to an alien if the alien was "a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>" and fell within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the permissible alien categories,
all of which required that an alien was in lawful status<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> See,
e.g., Fiscal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pub</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97-51</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stat</ENAMEX>.

continuing resolutions which included the residency requirement.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Residence</ENAMEX>" is a term of art within the meaning of immigration law
and is not synonymous with physical presence. In re <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olan</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">257</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supp</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">884</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S.D. Cal 1966</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Resident aliens</ENAMEX> are allowed to enter
and leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> temporarily without relinquishing their
status. See discussion infra Part <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (C)(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>). Thus, prior to FY
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> were authorized to represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who were
legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> regardless of whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alien</ENAMEX> was absent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> during some part of the
representation.
In drafting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s Fiscal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Year</TIMEX> (FY) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>
appropriations act, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time replaced the
language "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" with "present in the

Stat. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1071</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>). The legislative history reveals no explanation
for this change. The phrase "present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" appears
to have originated in proposed legislation that would have expanded
the categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> eligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> funded representation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX>
The shift in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> may have been based
15 From before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> amendment until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, the categories of
eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> included: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an alien lawfully admitted for
permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) an alien who was either married to a

categories would not possess "residence" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> under
the meaning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INA</ENAMEX> (for example, parolees and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX>/Haitian

frequently used in immigration laws to describe categories of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> who may not have established
"<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>." The proposed legislation was defeated, but the phrase
"present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" replaced the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> language
found in earlier statutes. The new language received virtually no
discussion; nothing in the legislative history suggests that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to adopt new or more stringent restrictions on
alien representation. Statements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> suggest that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> may not have been aware that the presence language
survived the defeat of the amendment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> In short, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FY</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>

LSC representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who were merely "present" as opposed
to lawful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. There is no evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to
deprive permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident aliens</ENAMEX> of continuous representation upon
their leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Following the statutory change, LSC
issued no new regulations interpreting the language, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
called for no new interpretation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantee practice did not
change.

The legislative history establishes that legal representation

that established the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> program. The creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> program
was controversial, given the history of prior temporary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bracero</ENAMEX> program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> was

legal representation to give meaning to their legal rights.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Congressman Berman</ENAMEX> explained on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> floor:
Part and parcel of that agreement was an understanding that the

if they otherwise qualified, to legal services representation,

the housing protections, the domestic, the transportation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protections</ENAMEX>, the piecework rate and adverse impact wage rates
protections become utterly meaningless. The fact is the history of
the abuses in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2</ENAMEX> program, which has been documented time and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> again, cannot be corrected without effective representation,
as you could easily contemplate guest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> coming here for a
short period of time, hoping to come back again, anxious to pick up
a wage considerably higher than the wage they might be making in
their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, have no individual ability and no effective

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bracero</ENAMEX> program has been likened by some to indentured

Some of the abuses that took place underthe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bracero</ENAMEX> program can be
directly attributed to the way the program was administered. The
most glaring problem was the contractual relationship that existed
requiring an employee to work for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>. This, some argue,
gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> the ability to require more from Bracero workers

choose the interpretation of presence that effectuates the

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> Continuing Resolution
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1996</TIMEX> Omnibus Continuing Resolution, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> revised the
restrictions on alien assistance by applying the restrictions to
all funds received by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pub</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> No. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">134</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">110 Stat</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1321</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> also for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time explicitly added H-2A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to the categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> eligible for legal assistance
under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> appropriations act, although that assistance remained
limited to claims under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>' employment contract. The other
categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> and the presence requirement were retained.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnibus Consolidated</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act</ENAMEX>,

Nothing
about the application of the "is present" language to the alien
categories was altered.
The legislative history of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> revision contains no
discussion of the "present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>" requirement and no
indication that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> sought to alter existing practice
regarding the representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">251</NUMEX>
(comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Houseman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Law & Social Policy</ENAMEX>). The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCollum-Stenholm</ENAMEX> bill, on which the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> appropriations were
based, did not address the presence requirement, and the statement
accompanying the introduction of that bill noted only that the bill
incorporated the provisions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRCA</ENAMEX> into the existing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">appropriation</ENAMEX>'s provisions on representation of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>. See
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">id</ENAMEX>. Thus, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> revision simply brought together in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place
the pre-existing provisions regarding representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> these restrictions to all funds of an LSC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX>.
Neither the language nor the legislative history of the statute
suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to alter the application of the
presence requirement.
In sum, the legislative history of the presence requirement
confirms that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to provide meaningful
representation to eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> on claims
arising from their employment contract; and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> did not
understand the presence requirement to severely alter or restrict
this representation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> Act was adopted to provide
effective legal representation to low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assistance Program</ENAMEX>). The presence language appeared in the LSC
appropriations act as part of an effort to expand LSC
representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> other than lawful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, and does not
appear to have been intended to limit LSC representation to aliens
who were continuously physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
Similarly, the express purpose of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 305</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRCA</ENAMEX> was to
"secure the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-2</ENAMEX> agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> under the specific
contract under which they were admitted to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>." See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONF</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REP. NO.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">91-1000</TIMEX>, (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>). Such representation was intended to
prevent the exploitation of foreign H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and to ensure that
the wages and working conditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> would not be
undermined. Finally, nothing in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> legislation altered the
effect of the presence requirement on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A's</ENAMEX> or any other alien
category.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Implications</ENAMEX> of the Presence Requirement
The factual record provides an important context for
consideration of the legal question of the meaning of the presence
requirement for representation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees. As noted above,
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> possible interpretations of the presence language were listed
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> notice: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an alien must be
physically present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> when the cause of action
for which the recipient provides legal assistance arises; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) an
alien must be physically present only when legal representation is
commenced; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) an alien must be physically present in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> any time the alien is provided legal assistance from
an LSC grantee<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> Upon careful consideration of the language and
purposes of the statute and the legislative history, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
has determined that none of these formulations fully responds to
the purposes of the statute or the intent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
the record demonstrates that the interpretations initially offered
by the Corporation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> notice would contradict
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' clear purpose of providing meaningful legal
representation to indigent lawful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> and lead to absurd
results.


<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unrestricted Categories</ENAMEX>
In giving content to the presence requirement, it is important
to distinguish between the unrestricted categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The record before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> establishes that
permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> frequently leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, to address family problems,
and to survive during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long</TIMEX> periods of unemployment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. The category of permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> includes commuter
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aliens</ENAMEX>, who work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> but whose actual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> is
across the border in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. All of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> are legally
authorized to leave and re-enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
As applied to the situation of unrestricted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, the three
interpretations of the presence requirement suggested in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> notice would lead to unintended and absurd
results. Under an interpretation that the alien must be physically
present when the cause of action commenced, or legal representation
began, an alien who was evicted from her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>, or against whom
divorce proceedings were commenced while she was temporarily out of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to attend a funeral or attend to a family
emergency, would be barred from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> representation. LSC attorneys
representing commuter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who migrate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> would be placed in
the predicament of representing such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> only in claims that
happened to arise during the portion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> when the alien was
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Under an interpretation that the alien must
be physically present when the representation commenced, an alien
who was temporarily outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would be barred from
obtaining legal services representation on
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reg</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8140, 8141</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>).
any matter during her absence. These interpretations would also
invite exploitation by allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> to simply wait until an
alien temporarily departed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> before cutting off
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> compensation benefits, initiating eviction, repossession,
divorce or child custody proceedings, or otherwise triggering the
cause of action or a need for representation. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> agricultural
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recruiters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> could willfully misrepresent working
conditions to permanent legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> across the border, knowing
the alien would be barred from legal assistance on her
federally-protected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MSWPA</ENAMEX> claim.
Requiring a permanent legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> alien to be physically
present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> throughout the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> legal
representation would also be unworkable and lead to absurd results.
The record is undisputed that many of the kinds of lawsuits
involving permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident aliens</ENAMEX> and other unrestricted aliens
take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, if not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, to reach a conclusion, and that
permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> and other eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> regularly travel
outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. An interpretation that required the
alien to be continuously present throughout the course of the
litigation would confront indigent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hobson</ENAMEX>'s choice
of either accepting representation or visiting their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
abroad.
Moreover, requiring legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to monitor their
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>' movements and formally withdraw whenever the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> left
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> would creating extraordinary burdens for the LSC
grantees, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. An
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> had to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to attend her
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s funeral, for example, would have to withdraw from the case
during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s absence. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> Testimony at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">139-140</ENAMEX>
(testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sylvia Argueta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Defense and</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Fund</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> representing alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> living in
border <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> would face the prospect that they could work on
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>'s case in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX> but
not in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> was shopping in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juarez</ENAMEX>. See
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April Testimony</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">109</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynn Coyle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Committee</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Rights Under Law</ENAMEX>). Application of this interpretation to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> border would disrupt access of permanent legal
residents to the legal system in the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">155</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Wyatt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rural Legal Aid, et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>). It also would provide perverse incentives
to opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> to drag out legal proceedings with the
expectation that an alien might have to temporarily depart from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, or engage in other forms of procedural abuse. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>

The private bar and other nonprofit legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> are

organizing private pro bono activities put it, "the likelihood that
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> will take on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> who would be excluded from LSC
representation by the stringent interpretation of [the presence]

Londen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law</ENAMEX>).
The legislative history contains no evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
intended LSC representation of legal permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> and other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> to turn on the accident of where an alien happened to be at
the moment the cause of action arose or the litigation commenced,
or to require the alien to be continuously physically present
throughout the course of representation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> does not
believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intended to force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident aliens</ENAMEX> to choose
between temporary trips outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and continued
representation in pending litigation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> has not been
able to discern any congressional purpose that would be served by
tying the right to representation on movements that have no effect
on either the alien's lawful immigration status or her legal right
to pursue her claim in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> is unwilling to
recommend an interpretation of the statute that produces such
consequences, absent an express congressional intent that such
burdens be imposed.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-2A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aliens</ENAMEX>
The factual record before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> demonstrates that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' purpose of providing meaningful representation to H-2A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for claims arising under their employment contracts cannot
be accomplished under the original interpretations offered in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> notice. Many of the contract rights that were
mandated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRCA</ENAMEX> -- such as reimbursement for return
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> compensation, the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/4</NUMEX> guarantee, and claims
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grower</ENAMEX> failed to mail the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s final paycheck -- often
do not arise until after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> has returned home. A
requirement that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> be physically present in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> when the cause of action arises or the representation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commences</ENAMEX> thus would deprive H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> of representation on many
of the most basic employment contract protections afforded by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, directly contrary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' purpose. As a practical
matter, this interpretation would also bar most other legal
representation for H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, since the record clearly
demonstrates that, due to their fear of losing their jobs, their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolation</ENAMEX>, lack of resources and language skills, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vulnerability</ENAMEX>, H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> often are both unwilling and unable to
contact a legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> until after they have left their
employment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-2A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> are required by law to leave the country
within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX> of the termination of their employment, and
generally remain in the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> during this
period.
The interpretations could also create incentives for abuse. An
interpretation that the representation must commence while the
alien is still in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> to
create even greater obstacles to access to legal services while the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are physically in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Employers</ENAMEX> who
successfully excluded legal services representatives from their
labor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> or intimidated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> into not contacting legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> during the course of employment could ensure a workforce
without access to legal representation. Under an interpretation
that the claim must arise while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, unscrupulous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> would be able to exploit the system
by, for example, failing to mail a final paycheck or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3/4</NUMEX> guarantee
payment after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with knowledge that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> would not be entitled to legal representation on the
claim.
Alternatively, an interpretation of the presence requirement
that required H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to be present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
throughout the course of the representation would eviscerate their
right to legal representation altogether. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> by
definition are required to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>,
and the record establishes that most H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are physically
present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two to five months</TIMEX>. The
record establishes that, with the exception of the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minor</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undisputed</ENAMEX> claims, none of the employment claims for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
authorized representation can be completed during the brief period
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, even if the claim arose
early during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s stay and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> was immediately able
to contact legal services. Many of the claims of H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are
legally complex, and all take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, if not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, to litigate to
completion. The contradiction between this interpretation and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' purpose of providing meaningful representation for H-2A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> is patent. The interpretation assumes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> took
from H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> with one hand what it gave with the other. The
law will not impute such a purpose to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
The factual record, moreover, demonstrates the absurdity of this
approach. As the record shows, it is not uncommon for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> workers
to contact legal services for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time as they board the bus
on the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, and an interpretation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> representation is
available only while the alien is physically present creates the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prospect</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> authorized legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to
represent such H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> only during the bus ride to the border.
The rule again would invite exploitation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Employers</ENAMEX> could veto a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worker</ENAMEX>'s decision to seek legal representation by terminating the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> and immediately deporting her. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">128</NUMEX>

avoid paying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> compensation could deny coverage until the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> was no longer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, or discontinue payments after
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> had returned home. Opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>
could prolong the legal process simply by refusing to return legal
service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>' phone calls or delaying provision of records to
which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> was entitled to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> left
the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> before a dispute could be resolved. See <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
Comments at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">231</NUMEX> (comment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melissa A. Pershing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>); <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Testimony at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34</NUMEX> (testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garry G.</ENAMEX>
Geffert, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> Plan). In all of these cases,
legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> would be barred from assisting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> in these
valid employment contract claims.
In short, the record is clear that H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are unlikely to
raise legal claims before the end of their employment contract,
that they are required to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
their contracts, that many of their claims arise after their
departure, and that legal proceedings cannot be completed before
they depart. Furthermore, the availability of legal services for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from non-LSC funded nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and
private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> is extremely limited; and government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
either lack the resources or the legal authority to enforce the
statutory rights of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> recognizes that
representation of agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> was a central element in the
legislative crafting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> program. We conclude that a
reading of the statute that would bar representation of an H-2A
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> based on the fact that he or she has left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
would leave H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> without meaningful representation on their
employment contract claims, directly contrary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' express
purpose, and we decline to sanction such a result.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONCLUSION</ENAMEX>: THE MEANING OF THE PRESENCE REQUIREMENT
Together, the language, purpose, and legislative history of the
applicable statutes, and the factual record before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>,
suggest an interpretation of the statute that would authorize the
following representation:
For an alien in one of the unrestricted categories
representation would be authorized so long as the eligible alien is
present sufficient to maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> or lawful immigration
status. Under this interpretation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> who have begun
representation of a permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> alien may continue that
representation should the alien be temporarily outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. Grantees may also initiate representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> in the
unrestricted categories who are temporarily outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, provided that they have been present sufficient to maintain
and have not abandoned their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">INA</ENAMEX> status. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees
may not represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> in this category who have never entered or
been present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
For H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, representation is authorized if the workers
have been admitted to and have been present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
pursuant to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> contract, and the representation arises under
their H<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-2A</TIMEX> contract. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees are authorized to litigate this
narrow range of claims to completion, despite the fact that the
alien may be required to depart the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> prior to or
during the course of the representation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees may not
represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> in this category who have never entered or been
present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
As discussed above, this interpretation comports with the
language of the presence requirement in light of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' object
and purpose. The language and legislative history of the LSC
appropriations acts and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H-2A</ENAMEX> statute make clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
intended to provide meaningful legal representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> in
the designated categories, and there is no evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
considered the presence requirement to severely restrict this
interpretation. To the contrary, the presence requirement was
inserted into the statute for the apparent purpose of expanding LSC
representation of legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>. Moreover, as interpreted by the
Commission, the presence requirement sustains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' clear goal,
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>, of restricting LSC representation to aliens
with lawful status.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s interpretation also comports with the
consistent practice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> grantees, and the understanding of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX>, and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. As noted above, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grantees</ENAMEX> have
regularly provided legal assistance to eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who have
left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> at some point during the representation. LSC
has never taken action against a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> which continued to
represent alien <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> had left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. Until recently <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>, who
had knowledge of the alien representation practices of legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>, never questioned the legality of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX>'s
representation of an alien after the alien had left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. It is well settled that a history of practice under a
statute can aid in its interpretation, particularly when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
has amended the statute without disapproving of the administrative
practice. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N.L.R.B.</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hendricks County Rural Elec</ENAMEX>. Membership
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp.</ENAMEX>,454 <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S. 170, 177</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>). In this case, the practices of LSC
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX>, and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> all support the
Commission's interpretation.
Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s interpretation of the presence
requirement is fully consistent with the overarching purpose of the
relevant congressional statutes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> Act was adopted
to provide full and effective legal representation to low income
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. In enacting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">LSC Act</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> declared the need to
provide equal access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s system of justice for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who seek redress of grievances and said attorneys
providing legal assistance must have full freedom to protect the
best interests of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in keeping with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Code</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Responsibility</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canon of Ethics</ENAMEX>, and the high
standards of the legal profession. The protections of the H-2A
statute were adopted, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">inter alia</ENAMEX>, to ensure that the employment of
foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> would not undermine the wages and working
conditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> provided legal services
representation "to secure the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-2</ENAMEX> agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>"
under their employment contracts. The record before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>
is undisputed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> cannot provide full and meaningful
representation to H-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and to many other eligible aliens
under the alternative constructions of the presence requirement.

interpretations would simply promote the exploitation of
vulnerable, low income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s interpretation is
the only interpretation which comports with the language and
legislative history of the presence requirement and which permits
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> and meaningful representation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> eligible for legal
assistance consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>' purpose.
