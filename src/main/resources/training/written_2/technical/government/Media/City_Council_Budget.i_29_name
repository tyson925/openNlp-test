<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council Budget Targets Legal Work</ENAMEX>
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Wise</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York City Council</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> offered a radically
different set of priorities for the handling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s legal
work in its response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>'s plan to close a projected
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.8 billion</NUMEX> budget deficit.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> plan would increase by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 50 percent</NUMEX> - to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$80.4 million</NUMEX> - the amount of funding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX> proposed for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX> by sharply curtailing compensation for
court-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> under the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-B program.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> plan would also reduce to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> the
Bloomberg plan's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> cut for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">District Attorney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Offices</ENAMEX>
citywide.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX>'s proposal for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650</NUMEX>-lawyer Corporation
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counsel's Office</ENAMEX> would slash its budget by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> - or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10.2</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> - to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$92 million</NUMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>'s budget
plan called for a modest <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 percent</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation Counsel</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>, leaving the office relatively untouched in comparison to
most other mayoral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
Council <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> that they did not have a head count
for the cuts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law Department</ENAMEX>, but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> plan
is tilted towards the elimination of legal positions, which at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
percent would require the layoff of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>.
At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> plan envisages dramatic cuts
in the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of many city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with a view to
transferring the work to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law Department</ENAMEX>. The plan also calls
for the elimination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Contracts</ENAMEX>, which would
save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.8 million</NUMEX>, and the transfer of the legal work done by that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation Counsel's Office</ENAMEX>.
Council <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> did not have a total for the savings that would be
realized in city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> through its plan. But,
they said, the proposal would save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> by eliminating more
than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Services</ENAMEX>,
many of whom prosecute neglect and abuse cases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Court</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Deacy</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>, was unavailable for comment.
Council <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> also identified steep cuts in the legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
Correction for a savings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanitation</ENAMEX>, saving <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$945,000</NUMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> lawyers
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Buildings</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$451,000</NUMEX> in savings.
Asked how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation Counsel's Office</ENAMEX> could take on the
expanded work while its own legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was being cut, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas L.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McMahon</ENAMEX>, the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX>, said that in view
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s "terribly difficult fiscal circumstances," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> plan provides a better way of "managing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s work
force given the resources we have."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate Ahlers</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokeswoman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation Counsel's Office</ENAMEX>,
said that her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> had not yet received the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX>'s plan
and could not comment.
The administrative savings proposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> through
the elimination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Contracts</ENAMEX> and many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> legal
positions were part of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$559 million</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> proposed to save
through "consolidation and efficiency" in management.
In total, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> proposed realizing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.65 billion</NUMEX>
through savings and increased fees, including restoration of the
commuter tax, to fund its own initiatives and offset some of the
cuts proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX> in his preliminary budget on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb.</TIMEX>
13.

Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aid Would Gain</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most dramatic changes in priorities proposed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> would shift <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25.6 million</NUMEX> from funding for
court-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX>. In a document
released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> to justify its reordered priorities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>
contended that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX> can achieve greater economies of scale
than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> appointed pursuant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article 18-</ENAMEX>B of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Law</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> document also noted that "inexplicably" <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-B lawyers
are handling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of the indigent criminal cases in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, even though their mandate is to handle only multi-defendant
cases where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX> had a conflict.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> had consistently added <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.6</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$54.7 million</NUMEX> proposed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX> by
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>, bringing the total to just a shade over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>. But this year for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> is proposing
shifting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $20 million</NUMEX> in funds earmarked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-B <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX>, which would increase its
total funding to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$80.4 million</NUMEX>. That would reflect a jump in its
current finding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one-third</NUMEX>.
Meantime, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> proposed slashing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>'s
allocation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$62.8 million</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-B <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 percent</NUMEX>, to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$21.4 million</NUMEX>.


Will Consider Proposal
City Criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coordinator John Feinblatt</ENAMEX> expressed a
willingness to look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>'s proposal. "In tough economic
times," he said, "we are willing to look at any proposal to
reallocate scarce resources."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> would restore - and slightly increase - funding for
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that handle legal work for indigent criminal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX> proposed to eliminate in his
preliminary budget. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> would allocate <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 million</NUMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neighborhood Legal Services</ENAMEX>, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.8</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of the Appellate Defender</ENAMEX>, which handles
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appeals</ENAMEX> for indigent criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> in the First
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> proposal would tamp down the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> cut that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX> proposed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> had estimated that a cut of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> would
reduce city spending for its district <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$231 million</NUMEX>
to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$215 million</NUMEX>, for a savings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$16 million</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX>'s documents did not itemize the savings projected at
the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> level, but using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>'s figures, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> cut
would result in budget for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$226.4 million</NUMEX> and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">savings</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.6 million</NUMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> budget would also restore <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7.4 million</NUMEX> in city
funding for civil legal services work done by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> had proposed
cutting.
