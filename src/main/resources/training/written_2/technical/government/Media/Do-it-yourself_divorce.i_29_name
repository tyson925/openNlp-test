Do-it-yourself divorce in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State-mandated</ENAMEX> course enables <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 70 percent</NUMEX> of divorcing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> to untie the knot without a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 21, 2003</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MONTPELIER</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vt.</ENAMEX> - A majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermonters</ENAMEX> who divorce do so
without hiring an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>.
Instead, they take a class on how to represent themselves.
The court-mandated session is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have filed for
divorce and opted not to hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Nearly 70 percent</NUMEX> of
Vermonters are divorced without an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>, according to
statistics from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court Administrator's Office</ENAMEX>.
Some are put off by the cost of a hiring a divorce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, which
starts at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $1,500</NUMEX>. Others just want to be in control of the
process.
"There's not a lot of low-cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> available. If you've got
limited resources and you think you can do it, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> does
help, then maybe this is the one thing that you forego in order to
pay for something else," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Fox</ENAMEX>, a former state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> who helped write the legislation to establish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Courts</ENAMEX> and who used to be the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Court</ENAMEX>
operations.
There are also risks to going it alone.
Many of the decisions that are made in front of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> cannot
be reversed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> established a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Court</ENAMEX> system in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. A separate
court system would bring divorce and child custody cases onto the
same docket as juvenile cases. The goal was to more quickly resolve
cases that had to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> said.
"Because it's a place where the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paramount</ENAMEX>, we want it to be a place where you can get these cases
resolved quickly," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> said.
Family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Court</ENAMEX> was set up as a user-friendly place and continues
to add programs to streamline the process.
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> wasn't necessarily established to allow the
majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vermonters</ENAMEX> to represent themselves in a divorce, that
has been the effect.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Garrett</ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Law Line</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vermont</ENAMEX>, said he worries most about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have reading
problems, disabilities or who are so traumatized by the divorce
itself that they lack judgment in making decisions. Those people
could benefit from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> if they can afford <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, he said.
"If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are relatively sophisticated, relatively literate and
have cool judgment so they can express themselves well and listen
well, they can probably handle this themselves," he said.
