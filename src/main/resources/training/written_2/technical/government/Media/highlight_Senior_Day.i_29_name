"But it's like trying to tell a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> about rock 'n'
roll."

It's just this hard when I try to answer the question: Why do
older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Oklahomans</ENAMEX> need <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>? The answers are important enough
that they will be a discussion topic of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Senior Day</ENAMEX> at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 25</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Chamber</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>. The following
is a preview of some of the answers for review:
We can all agree that older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Oklahomans</ENAMEX> need medical care. But
even the best care is worthless if an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> can't drive to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> for ongoing treatment because his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> has been
wrongfully seized in a debt dispute. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are part of
the prescription for regular medical care for many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Oklahomans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 60 and older</TIMEX>.
Another example: if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> treats an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> for a
lung ailment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>'s treatment will be undone and he will see
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> again and again, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is sent home to an
unheated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> know how to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX> heat
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> so the medical treatment can stick. (By the way, a May
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 2001</TIMEX>, article in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX> reports on a program at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Medical Center</ENAMEX> providing a walk-in legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> to help fight their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' legal and administrative
battles.)
We also can agree that older <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahomans</ENAMEX> - like all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> -
have rights to control their health care until they become
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incapacitated</ENAMEX> or these rights are transferred to another by legal
document or process. "Old" is not a legal classification that
results in automatic loss of these rights. Moreover, having an old
parent does not automatically confer on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> the right to make
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' health care choices.
It follows that an important role <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> provide for aging
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oklahomans</ENAMEX> is not only to create rights - transferring documents
such as durable powers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> and guardianship orders, but
also to monitor their use. In family situations, for example,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> must ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> and guardianships are
used to serve only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> transferring or losing rights. They
are not to be used to help a family "manage" their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> or help a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> or nursing home get permission for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX> or procedure they
feel is in the best interest of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Good news: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> now
has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Guardianship Program</ENAMEX>, albeit unfunded, that will
supply <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to perform this rights-monitoring process
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> should be able to enjoy their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandchildren</ENAMEX>, not raise them. But owing to the social problems of
divorce and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> are increasingly being called on
to raise their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> because of missing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Adding to
the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on,
grandparents face legal problems.
All the decisions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> made without a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thought now
require evidence of legal authority when made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX>.
Grandparents can't get shots for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX>, enroll them
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or sign field trip permission slips unless they can prove
by legal document that rights that lie naturally in the parents
have been transferred to them. This requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to help
grandparents with durable powers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>, guardianships,
custody and sometimes adoption.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> are also needed to make the system work. Our judicial
system works well only when both sides have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. Effective
representation should not be an accident of geography, economic
status or age.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> needed to meet these challenges now are being
supplied in part by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Services of Oklahoma</ENAMEX> (LASO) under
contract with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> on aging covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, subject to certain limitations on types of cases, are
free to those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 and older</TIMEX>.
To help put a face on the legal needs of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oklahomans</ENAMEX>, each
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> attending <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Senior Day</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 25</TIMEX> will receive a compilation
of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> stories written by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LASO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> and paralegals
about how they have improved the lives of older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oklahomans</ENAMEX>.
