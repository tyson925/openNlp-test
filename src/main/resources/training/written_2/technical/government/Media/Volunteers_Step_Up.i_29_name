<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Volunteers Step Up on Law Day</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert E. Hirshon</ENAMEX>
On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Law Day</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> are going back to
school.
They're going into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> understand and
appreciate fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> values. A new "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dialogue on Freedom</ENAMEX>"
Web site -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dialogueonfreedom</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX> -- is giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> the
tools to conduct robust discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. The hope is that
young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will come to understand that we can maintain the
freedoms that are rooted in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s very soul while ensuring
the safety of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. Even within the new and frightening
landscape of the post-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 11</TIMEX> world, the familiar landmarks of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> can -- indeed, must -guide
us.
This major initiative, conceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court Justice</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony M. Kennedy</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX>'s principal Law
Day outreach <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. I salute the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of the legal
profession who are donating their time, skills and experience to
enhance public understanding of and respect for the rule of law
that defines our democracy and protects our freedoms.
Another kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> volunteerism deserves a salute on this
Law Day -- the tireless pro bono efforts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, whereby
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> take no fee for legal work that enables <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of limited
means to get the help they need.
Over the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> are carved the words
"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Equal Justice Under Law</ENAMEX>." These words represent both a reality and
an aspiration. A reality in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are open to
everyone, and even the least powerful can seek justice, against the
mightiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>. But the words are also an aspiration, because
many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> can't afford legal services, and so are unable to
take full advantage of our great legal system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> and state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar associations</ENAMEX> have worked
tirelessly to bring legal services to more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. In
keeping with those efforts, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Assuring Equal Justice for All</ENAMEX>" is the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theme of Law Day</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> became involved in the work of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> when I was
appointed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standing Committee on Lawyers' Public Service</ENAMEX>
Responsibility. A substantial focus of our work then and now was
encouraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to donate their services pro bono publico --
"for the good of the public." At that time, barely 20 years
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>:


-
The organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> did not have an infrastructure to
supply volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to meet the legal needs of the
poor.


-
Bar-sponsored pro bono programs -- where they did exist
-- were mostly local and mainly urban, with volunteer lawyers
representing a fairly narrow slice of the legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.


Our profession, however, did not sit idly by. We organized.
Working together, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Legal Aid and Defender</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> created a new system of legal services, linking pro
bono programs with local legal service programs to serve the needs
of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
The most tangible evidence of this effort was the development of
bar-sponsored pro bono programs in every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, in every sizable
metropolitan area, and in many rural areas as well.
The success of these programs is undeniable. We have not simply
changed a profession; we have changed lives.
We have improved the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> -- by resolving
complicated and hostile family disputes, by facilitating adoptions
and custody agreements, and by helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> find the comfort,
the certainty and the safety of home and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.
We have improved the lives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> -- by protecting our
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> from unscrupulous business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> and by giving
the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> financial security and comfort through
voluntary estate planning.
We have improved the lives of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> -- by
assuring that those who are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of domestic violence can seek
orders of protection, divorces and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> support, so they can leave
dangerous situations and raise their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in an environment
where fear is not a constant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX>.
But more remains to be done. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, we estimate that only
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> of the legal needs of the poor are met through legal aid
and pro bono. I call on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> everywhere to share in the highest
aspirations of our profession, and to help realize our unwavering,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unyielding</ENAMEX> commitment to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200-year-old</TIMEX> promise of equal justice
under law for everyone.
