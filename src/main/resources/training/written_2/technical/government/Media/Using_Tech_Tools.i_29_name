Technology is slowly transforming pro bono efforts, on and off
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>. But there is still a long way to go.
Pro bono has come a long way in a short time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan M. Hoffman</ENAMEX>,
the pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crowell</ENAMEX> &
Moring, regularly receives queries from non-profit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
via email. She compiles the emails into different messages and
distributes them to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, who volunteer, sometimes
via email, to take the cases.
"I have a political asylum email list, a domestic violence list,
a hotline list, and so on," she says. She carefully notes the
referring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Charities Legal Network</ENAMEX>, or the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair Housing Council</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greater Washington</ENAMEX> - in each email.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> also maintains her own database of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attorney</ENAMEX>
interests. "I can go in and search and pull up an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>
interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse and neglect, so when I get a case, I can
target it," she says.
Recently she had lunch with some of the referring legal
assistance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to try to improve their recruitment and
matching efforts even more. She also sends around pro bono email
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">questionnaires</ENAMEX> to find out which types of cases <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> are most
interested in.
Technology is transforming pro bono but there is a great deal to
do, particularly as many legal assistance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> still lack basic
technology, such as Internet connections. Those places need
donations of good equipment as much or more than they need
donations of lawyer <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>.
But as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> try to meet demands with technology, the basic
needs remain: meeting the need for legal services among the poor or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underserved</ENAMEX>. Some of the unmet needs are among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can pay,
but who are deterred from seeking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> because of the
uncertainty about legal fees and their fear of the profession.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Susskind</ENAMEX> calls these potential
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> "the latent market." Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and solos are ideal for
such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, but the clumsy, sometimes impersonal referral
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, and the prejudice against flat-fee billing serve as huge
barriers between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>. Slowly, Web sites are emerging
to serve them: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Divorcelawinfo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> educate themselves
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> divorce; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MyCounsel</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> is aimed at small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and
there are many others, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nolo</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, which helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> help
themselves, without a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>. But there is little public awareness
of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> at present.
A recent front page story in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> featured a
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who was answering legal questions on a Web
site called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Askme</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, with knowledge he gleaned solely from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX>
TV and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX>'s televised <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX>.
"Despite public perceptions to the contrary, there is an
enormous gap between those in need of legal assistance and the
lucky few who manage to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to counsel them," says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esther</ENAMEX>
Lardent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Bono Institute</ENAMEX>. "Technology is one
important tool to help bridge this gap-by making it easier for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> to find each other, making basic legal
information more easily available, and demystifying the law so that
potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> are more willing to seek legal help."
The need is great. Even after it was revealed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AskMe</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX> that
"LawGuy1975" was only fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> continued to ask
for him by name. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LawGuy</ENAMEX>'s answers were clear and
prompt, while the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>' answers could be turgid, filled
with statutory language, including formal citations, sometimes
posted long after the question appeared.
But it's clear that there are indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> out there, many
from small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, who are ready and able to help. The problem is
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AskMe</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> don't do a good job of matching lawyers
who are licensed in a particular jurisdiction (or, in the case of
LawGuy1975, licensed at all) with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in the same area.
The need to distinguish between ANY legal information, which
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LawGuys</ENAMEX> can provide, and GOOD guidance, which knowledgeable lawyers
can provide, remains paramount.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> area where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are reaching out effectively to clients
over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX> is immigration law. Sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visalaw</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shusterman</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, provide a wealth of information in several
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">languages</ENAMEX>, free email newsletters, and up-to-date, targeted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Siskind</ENAMEX>, who launched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visalaw</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, says he is working on
building personal, secure Web sites for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> who wants <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>,
so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can check the status of their cases without having to
call the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>.
Tight immigrant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> (the personal kind) help publicize the
most effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX>. And immigration is ideal for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Web</ENAMEX>:
it's a federal, forms-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> that rarely requires meeting
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX>.
But in practice areas other than immigration, linking lawyers
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> still revolves around either asking your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> if they know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, or calling a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar association</ENAMEX> and
getting the next name on the list. A plethora of listings are
available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">com</ENAMEX>, but the amount of information is almost
overwhelming to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX>.
Recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> launched
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Findlegalhelp</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>. Like like many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> sites, it takes a while to
download, and it requires a few clicks to actually find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>,
but once you plow your way through a few screens, you find that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> has placed an asterisk next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> that have earned
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>'s approval:
i-Lawyer.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>* <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Bar Association</ENAMEX>* <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles County Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyer Referral Service</ENAMEX>* Assoc. of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar of the City of New York</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyer Referral Service</ENAMEX>*
Of course, if you're not in those areas, you're back to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AskMe</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FreeAdvice</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RipOffCity</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com</ENAMEX>. Some wonderful legal
service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Public</ENAMEX>
Interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers</ENAMEX>, (NAPIL), at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">napil</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>, have Web sites that
are devoid of explanations about what public interest lawyers
really do, and which appear to be so corporate in appearance that
they could just as easily be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annual Report</ENAMEX>. Many of the
materials are posted only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDF</ENAMEX> (portable document format), which
must be downloaded to be read.
Private practioners must step up to the plate to reach out to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, online, if only to save the image of the profession
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from LawGuy1975</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAPIL</ENAMEX>. Remember that contacting legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
for pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> can lead to paying work.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans' Organizations</ENAMEX>, the
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aid Society</ENAMEX>-these are networks bigger than most corporate
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, involving contract disputes, benefits work, contacts with
large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government agencies</ENAMEX> that themselves could be the source of
work. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts</ENAMEX> contacts bring in contract disputes, copyright disputes,
even international artistic disputes, as when a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>
displayed his work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX>, only to see his work destroyed.
When small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and solos do use technology to help smaller
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, the resulting publicity can generate much good will. Sole
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">practitioner Carolyn Elefant</ENAMEX>, frustrated that
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> cases were posted all over the Web, but
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> needed to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in benefits cases, adoption
matters, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord/tenant</ENAMEX> disputes were not, built her own pro
bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> on her Web site, at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX>his.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">com/~Israel/loce/pro</ENAMEX>
bono/pro bono.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. In addition to being a wonderful library of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>, it has become a source of referrals, she said.
Indeed, new Web sites can now be a destination for those cold
calls (or e-mails) seeking legal help that used to be turned away
or sent to the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar association</ENAMEX>. As most laws vary
state-by-state, queries from out-of-state used to meet a dead end.
But now, criminal law queries can be referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Families Against</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandatory Minimums</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">famm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>, a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that might be
able to help a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX>, no matter where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. More such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are needed.
A major Web site dedicated to pro bono, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ProBono</ENAMEX>.net, is
seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> to mount and maintain pages within its site dedicated
to particular issues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crowell & Moring</ENAMEX> may take on an
Employment Law page, says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX>. Basic grunt work, such as
putting form documents and templates on the Web, is still needed.
"Drafting a complaint in a custody case is pretty rudimentary, but
can be intimidating" if you've never done it before, acknowledges
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProBono</ENAMEX>.net hooks up experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> with relative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">newbies</ENAMEX>. But what really, really sells pro bono cases is that the
work is interesting, meaningful and rewarding. They involve direct
service. And good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> can and should provide it, using all the
tools available in our time.
