As it waits to learn the fate of its contaminated office
building across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX>
has turned its attention to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX> neighborhood
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>.
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX> will break ground at the first building it
has ever owned, located at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">128th Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue</ENAMEX>. Legal Aid breaks

ground in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem Built</ENAMEX> of brick and the width of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about four</NUMEX>
brownstones, the fivestory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is designed to blend in with
the architecture of the surrounding neighborhood. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> upon
which it is being built had been vacant.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel L. Greenberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX>, said the new
building has both symbolic and practical significance.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlem</ENAMEX> was our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>," he said. "Regardless of
vagaries in funding, we will remain in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX>."
Legal Aid has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 25</NUMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>,
currently located on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theresa</ENAMEX>. It hopes to bring on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another 25</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> when the new
building opens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next fall</TIMEX>.

Renderings of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Phillips Group</ENAMEX>, bear some resemblance to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency's Church</ENAMEX> Street <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Manhattan</ENAMEX>, which was
contaminated with toxins during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>
attacks.
Along with office space, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> will include meeting rooms
for
community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, a playroom for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>, a
technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a legal education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and a legal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theresa de Leon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief operating officer</ENAMEX>, said as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> searched for new office space, it learned that buying a
building would be less expensive than renting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. She added that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Theresa</ENAMEX> could not support the technology needed to run a
modern law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is financed by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18 million</NUMEX> in tax-exempt bonds
through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Development Agency</ENAMEX>, payable over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
Legal Aid is also starting what it calls "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campaign</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX>,"
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> fund-raising effort to increase and improve the
services it offers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine M. Kurtz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of development, said the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> would emphasize services for the elderly, housing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preservation</ENAMEX>, employment advocacy, domestic violence and support
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> of small businesses.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> has set a goal of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> of
its fund-raising campaign. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> said it had already raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>, mostly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">law firms</ENAMEX> on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">benefactors</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next four years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX> intends to raise
an additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX>.
