<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes Volunteers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyer</ENAMEX> to Poor
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 18, 2002</TIMEX>
Defeated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> for re-election, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gov.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Barnes</ENAMEX> announced
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that he will spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his first six months</TIMEX> out of office as an
unpaid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX>, where he will
represent poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
"<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX> I'll probably do some legal work that I will charge a
handsome fee for - at least I hope there are those that are still
willing to pay," he told reporters.
"But for now, I think it is important to fulfill my duty as a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to help those who need it the most, to speak for those who
cannot speak for themselves and to defend those whose life and
livelihoods depend on it," he said.
Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> have gone to prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">law firms</ENAMEX>, joined
corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> or returned to thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>.
"I don't think I've ever heard of anybody doing this before,"
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emory University</ENAMEX> political science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merle Black</ENAMEX> said.
"If he's actually going to represent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> for that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, they're going to get great representation. You're
going to get some powerful legal muscle there," Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes</ENAMEX> said he already has his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case, but he wouldn't
say what it is.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta Legal Aid</ENAMEX> provides civil services to poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
metro <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes</ENAMEX> said he was hoping to send a message to other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>.
"This privilege to practice law is just that - it's a privilege.
And it comes with a cost and it comes with a bill . . . We as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have a responsibility to make sure that everyone,
regardless of whether they can afford it or not, has quality
representation. And if we don't do that, then we're not much of a
profession," he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Gottlieb</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX>'s executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, said, "I
can't imagine anything that could be better than to have the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, in his first act as a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>,
donate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> of his time to represent poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> . . . That's
just astounding to me."
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes</ENAMEX> did not necessarily need to seek a top-salaried job
after leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Financial disclosure reports and tax returns
he released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> showed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes</ENAMEX> had a net worth of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12.3</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX>.
