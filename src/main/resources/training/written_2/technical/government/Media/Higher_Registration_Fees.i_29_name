<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SPRINGFIELD</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Registration</ENAMEX> fees for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> could jump
as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">much as $49</NUMEX> a year if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> adopt <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate measures to
bolster pro-bono services and support for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Supreme Court</ENAMEX> is pushing for legislation that would
allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal
services to the poor. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> are floating a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$42</NUMEX> increase to
shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding
mechanism for legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> has fallen short in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>.
Currently, support for non-profit legal aid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> comes from
interest generated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers' Trust Fund</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools clients</ENAMEX>'
money that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low
interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being
generated.
After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of discussion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high court</ENAMEX> agreed that raising
the registration fees would be the best way to address the
declining revenues, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses W. Harrison II</ENAMEX> said. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided
that supporting probono services was important enough "and lawyers
had a responsibility to contribute" to the cause, Harrison
said.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high court</ENAMEX> raised the base fee for active
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$180</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$140</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their first three years</TIMEX> of
practice or who are inactive pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90</NUMEX>, and retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> pay
nothing.
Legislation circulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high court</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobbyist</ENAMEX> specifies
that the hike would apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> "paying full annual
registration fees." In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57,392</NUMEX> active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74,311</NUMEX> on the full roll, according to the Attorney
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Registration and Disciplinary Commission</ENAMEX>.
The hike would raise <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $2.4 million</NUMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, interest on the trust fund totaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.5 million</NUMEX>, but
service and handling fees consumed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$538,000</NUMEX> of that amount. This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>'s returns are projected to be anywhere between <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700,000 and $1</NUMEX>
million short of that mark, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Ann Schmitt</ENAMEX>, the executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX> said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the
shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount
available.
"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking
point," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmitt</ENAMEX> said. "We have a tough time raising enough money to
properly fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> need."
Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois State Bar Association</ENAMEX> nor The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Bar</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'s initiative is far from a done deal. The proposal has
not been attached to any legislation currently viable in either the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> needs legislative approval to set up a
separate state account to deposit the money.
That would mark a change from the way money earned through the
Interest on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyer Trust</ENAMEX> Account, or IOLTA, is handled.
In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high court</ENAMEX> once became embroiled in a dispute with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditor general's office</ENAMEX> over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> could examine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOLTA</ENAMEX> funds because they were not in a state account.
On another front, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s largest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar associations</ENAMEX> are
backing a measure to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> registration fees by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7</NUMEX> to
fund the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers' Assistance Program</ENAMEX>. That legislation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Bill</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4078</TIMEX>, would also use a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX> account to collect the money.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers' Assistance Program</ENAMEX> is designed to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> or alcohol abuse problems, or with mental health problems.
The bill calling for the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7</NUMEX> increase passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> but is
currently stalled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. The legislation must pass the
hearing stage by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next Thursday</TIMEX>.
Legislation is available online at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legis</ENAMEX>.state.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">il</ENAMEX>.us.
