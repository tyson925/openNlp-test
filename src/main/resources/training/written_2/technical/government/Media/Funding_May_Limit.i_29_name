<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funding May Limit Legal Aid</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Victims</ENAMEX> of Domestic
Violence

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday, October 18, 2002</TIMEX>
Low-income domestic violence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> may find long-term legal
help -- representation in divorces or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-custody disputes --
hard to come by, if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> now providing such help can't
replace their lost funding.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah Legal Services</ENAMEX> are
already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of
more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$450,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> overseeing the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Crime Victim</ENAMEX>
Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from
the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. While describing the request as a worthy
cause, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> agreed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that funding divorces or
custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> for crime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175,000</NUMEX> requested would have allowed the legal aid groups
to maintain a skeleton <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to continue providing help beyond
emergency protective orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, completing existing cases
and offering services in limited cases.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> also plan to enlist more pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> through
coordination with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah State Bar</ENAMEX>.
"We don't have a lot more options," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Milne</ENAMEX>, executive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah Legal Services</ENAMEX>, after learning of the CVR refusal
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has already lost some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> through attrition
and has turned away some cases, she said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milne</ENAMEX> said she may ask
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> overseeing her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to give her until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> to
seek funding from additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal
help is unclear.
For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had received <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> civil legal
assistance grants from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Justice</ENAMEX> and had used them to provide such
assistance. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> request was denied.
Funding used to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> obtain emergency protective orders
remains in place, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milne</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart Ralphs</ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX>.
Although an order's requirements that an abuser stay away from a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> may remain in effect for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, protective orders only
settle issues such as child custody, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> support, custody and
property arrangements for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 days</TIMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> are reluctant to
address those issues in emergency protective orders, since the
decrees stay in effect for such a short time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milne</ENAMEX> and Ralphs
said.
"The likelihood a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> will return to her abuser increases if
she cannot permanently sever the relationship and establish
workable support, custody and property arrangements," the funding
request to CVR said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX> said it denied the grant application,
in part, because evaluators did not see enough collaboration
between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralphs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milne</ENAMEX>
told CVR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. While the two said they believe their
organizations coordinate well, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> cannot appeal the
grant denial.
Although CVR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> considered giving the money as a
loan, not a grant, their vote on the funding request -- taken after
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milne</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralphs</ENAMEX> left the meeting -- was unanimous.
