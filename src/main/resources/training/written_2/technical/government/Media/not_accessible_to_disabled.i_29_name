<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> alleges <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Olathe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> not accessible to
disabled
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DAN MARGOLIES</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas City Star</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> has sued the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> and civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> large apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in
Olathe, alleging violations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fair Housing Act</ENAMEX> requirement
that multifamily <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX> be accessible to the disabled.
The lawsuit involves the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridgeview Apartments</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-unit
complex on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">119th Street</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ridgeview Road</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meadows Apartments</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">148</NUMEX>-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">119th Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Road</ENAMEX>.
"We continue to place a high priority on assuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
with disabilities have the same opportunities to rent and buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">condominiums</ENAMEX> as everyone else," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph F. Boyd Jr.</ENAMEX>, assistant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> for civil rights, in a written statement.
"When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> and civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>
fail to design and construct housing so it is accessible, they
effectively take that housing off the market for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have,
or will develop, a disability."
The suit, filed in federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kan.</ENAMEX>, is the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> brought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNL Associates/Architects</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allenbrand-Drews</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associates</ENAMEX> Inc., a civil engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last May</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> made similar allegations against the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> for their work on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Olathe</ENAMEX> apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestead Apartment Homes and Wyncroft Hill Apartments</ENAMEX>, both near
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">119th Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Black Bob Road</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael Norris</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allenbrand-Drews</ENAMEX>, said his
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> "vigorously dispute the allegations."
He said many of the alleged violations are "very minor," and
added: "We regret that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> elected to spend the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>' money by filing suit prematurely. We look forward to
having our day in court so that we can respond to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>."
Both suits arose after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX> of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> sent
trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX>, acting as prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">renters</ENAMEX>, to check on the
accessibility of apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in the area. The suits were
filed after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX> filed complaints with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> and efforts to resolve the complaints
fell through.
The lawsuit over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ridgeview</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meadows</ENAMEX> alleges numerous
violations of the accessibility requirements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fair Housing</ENAMEX>
Act, which requires that multifamily <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX> built since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> be
accessible to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with disabilities.
The alleged violations include doors that are too narrow for
wheelchairs, steps and thresholds that are barriers to access, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kitchens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> with insufficient space for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> using
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wheelchairs</ENAMEX> to move freely.
The suit also charges the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> with violations of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">With Disabilities Act</ENAMEX> because the common areas of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>' clubhouse rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> are allegedly not accessible to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled</ENAMEX>.
The suit seeks a court order requiring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> to correct
the alleged violations, to pay compensation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
disabilities whose rights were allegedly violated, and to pay civil
and punitive penalties.
Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allenbrand-Drews</ENAMEX>, the suit names as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Allenbrand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loren Drews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Allenbrand-Drews</ENAMEX>;
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> or contractors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.L. Davis, R.L. Davis Co.</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porta-McCurdy Development Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summit Contractors Inc.</ENAMEX>, Olathe
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Leased Housing Associates I, Olathe Leased Housing Associates II</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHG Olathe Partners</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationwide Housing Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominium Kansas One</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominium Olathe Partners</ENAMEX>.
Also named is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominium Management Services Inc.</ENAMEX>, property
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> said
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> was named as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> because its services may be required
to implement a remedy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blois Olson</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominium</ENAMEX>, said
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> didn't build the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> but only acquired them.
"We've been fully cooperating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX>
throughout the whole process and we'll continue to do so," he
said
