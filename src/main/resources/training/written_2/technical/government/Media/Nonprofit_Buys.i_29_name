<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> wants to share space with
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> providing legal help and basic

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>.

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 9 2001</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX> has purchased an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oxnard</ENAMEX>
building it had been renting since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>, moving the
provider of legal services for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ventura County</ENAMEX>'s poor closer to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
goals.
The purchase will help meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s long-term plan of
establishing a one-stop "justice center" for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that provide
services to the poor.
It also will allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in one building its
migrant-worker legal assistance program and a newer basic services
program. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> programs are currently housed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> about a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> apart. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oxnard</ENAMEX> office broadened its
services from farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>-related aid to basic assistance last year
when the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> chose to fund it, over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel Counties</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX>'s sole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> of legal help to the
poor.
The migrant program generally has taken on issues related to
farm labor and has represented large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The basic
program represents <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> on cases involving labor, housing
and claims for public benefits.
The purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on A Street in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oxnard</ENAMEX> also
signals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>'s intention to establish
roots, said its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>.
"To me, it symbolizes a long-term presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,"
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santos Gomez</ENAMEX>, directing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s migrant
services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. "We want the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to know that we are
committed to try to address social injustice."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> will be named the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cruz Reynoso</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Center</ENAMEX>. It
will be the first building anywhere to be named after the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latino</ENAMEX> to serve on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Supreme Court</ENAMEX>.
Naming the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reynoso</ENAMEX> seemed appropriate because the
former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> came from a farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker family</ENAMEX> that toiled in fields
from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange County</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Valley</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Padilla</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>'s statewide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>.
"It's a great honor to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> dedicated to justice and
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> . . . named after me," said
Reynoso, who is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UC Davis Law School</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>. "Those are the
issues I have devoted my life to.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX> has provided legal services to
farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and other poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> statewide for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 years</TIMEX>. Its
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oxnard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> has provided services exclusively to farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for
more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $60,000</NUMEX> to purchase the A Street
building. Half the money was raised from local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, including
farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.
"We wanted to show that we were a part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and that
they were a part of us," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Padilla</ENAMEX> said. "How do you develop
ownership if not through a project that required local
funding<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
But the main funding comes from a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$650,000</NUMEX> loan the statewide
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> took out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padilla</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> plans to keep
raising money locally to help pay the mortgage.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> also houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> that were already
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s migrant program will move in, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> will spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</TIMEX> looking for nonprofit groups
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> to make up the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice center</ENAMEX>.
The idea is to bring together <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> that provide
services "consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRLA</ENAMEX>'s mission to alleviate poverty and
to empower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gomez</ENAMEX>. He has already begun
contacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> that might be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example might be immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, a service that clients
often need but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> does not provide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gomez</ENAMEX>
said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padilla</ENAMEX> said the model of owning a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that functions as a
one-stop legal service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> is a new endeavor for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that house its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> owns or co-owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is successful in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oxnard</ENAMEX>, it may be used at other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Rural Legal Assistance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
"I'm hoping that what this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> does is open a dialogue with
other nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> to plan out what are the legal needs of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> that could be served through such a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>," Padilla
said.
