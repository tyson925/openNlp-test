How <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Can We Keep Lawyers Doing Good</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationwide Survey</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Determine Public Interest Law Recruitment/Retention Trends</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 22</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AScribe Newswire</ENAMEX>) -- Pity the "poor"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>. That is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who serves the poor and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disenfranchised</ENAMEX>. Although the cause is just, the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $</NUMEX>40K
starting salary reflects no equality in the marketplace and the law
school loan can be larger than a mortgage. Public interest and
government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector employers</ENAMEX> fear that these barriers will turn too
many young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> away from the battleground of equal justice
and their departure will place the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> system in
crisis.
To determine if and why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> will stay with or leave public
interest law, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 8, 2002</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX> for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Interest Law</ENAMEX> (NAPIL) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Legal Aid and Defender</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> will launch an online survey at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">napil</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/</ENAMEX>
The survey is designed to gauge the level of the judicial and
educational debt crises. Results of the survey, which is expected
to collect responses from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> legal services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys general</ENAMEX>, public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> and local civil liberties law
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, will be released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> at the annual meeting of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association for Law Placement</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAPIL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Associate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheila Siegel</ENAMEX>, Esq., the survey project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>,
noted, "After an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year of public interest
employment, we have no idea about who continues in the field, who
leaves and why. Our results will be brand new data that can fuel
solutions to the 'pricing out' of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>'s public interest law
options due to low salaries and enormous law school loan
payments."
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association for Public Interest Law</ENAMEX> leads the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in organizing, training and supporting public
service-minded law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and in creating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and postgraduate
public interest jobs that bring equal justice to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
