Lending practices still face scrutiny

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eileen Ledford</ENAMEX> says she learned too late that her new home loan
was based on a lie.
The mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> put her age at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>. And he claimed she earned
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> - or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$132,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> - from a home quilting
business she had owned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 years</TIMEX>.
"I'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX>," she said, adding that she never owned a quilting
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, never worked for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and never told a loan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> she did.
"I don't even know how to quilt."
What the imaginary quilting business did produce was a loan that
she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Linn</ENAMEX>, who is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> and suffers from congestive
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart failure</ENAMEX>, cannot possibly afford.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> times they have signed with high-interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX> that
refinanced their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> home, gave them some cash and escalated
their debts. The latest is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fieldstone Mortgage Co.</ENAMEX>, which is
charging them <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,290</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$859</NUMEX> more than their combined
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly retirement</TIMEX> income.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX> they couldn't make the payment on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> they have
owned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 years</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryan Reilly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> who admits putting the nonexistent
quilting business on the loan application, shared <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15,600</NUMEX> in
commis- sions with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that referred the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ledfords</ENAMEX> to him a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year ago</TIMEX>. He said he was just trying to help them get the money
they needed for credit card bills and home improvements.
But in hindsight, "I really wish I'd never done the loan," he
told The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denver Post</ENAMEX>. "It didn't really help them in the long
run."
At the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Capitol</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> will debate
what to do about such loans.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> is expected to vote on a bill sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sen.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linkhart</ENAMEX> to combat "abusive home loan practices." It would limit
loan fees and ban several "predatory" practices such as prepayment
penalties and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">balloon</ENAMEX> payments on high-cost home loans.
Linkhart, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>, introduced the bill at the behest
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AARP</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACORN</ENAMEX> and other consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. He expects it to pass the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> but foresees trouble in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX>-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>.
Lining up against his bill are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> who contend it
would undermine an already weakened housing market and deny home
loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with shaky credit.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Association of Mortgage Brokers</ENAMEX>, for one, is
campaigning instead to license <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> and create a mortgage board
where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> could take complaints. But its proposal faces
opposition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Mortgage Lenders Association</ENAMEX>, which
argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> should not shoulder new regulations and higher
costs just because a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are writing bad loans.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosemary Marshall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>, is preparing a
predatory-lending bill with fewer restrictions than Linkhart
proposed. While she supports his bill, "my objective is to get
something done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>," she said.
The inspiration for this flurry of proposals is the
fast-growing, aggressively marketed subprime lending industry. The
federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> now tracks <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> specializing in
subprime loans that broaden access to home mortgages, but at a
price that typically includes higher interest rates and fees, and
other costly requirements.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Elderly</ENAMEX> and minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> hold a disproportionate share of
these higher-cost loans.


"No good resource' for help
Using federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> loan data, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Post</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> that
black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31/2</NUMEX> times as likely as white
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> to borrow from subprime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenders</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> 21/2
times as likely. The data also showed that black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> earning
more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> were more likely to get subprime loans
than white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> earning <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than $30,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, a pattern
that reflected national trends.
When a high-cost loan appears destined to drive the borrower to
default, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> say there are few places
to turn for help.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Fedge</ENAMEX>, a mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eileen Ledford</ENAMEX>,
said he faces the same dilemma again and again. By the time
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowners</ENAMEX> seek help, they have lost much of their equity. They
have no money for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>. And state law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
focus on patterns of fraudulent behavior, not problems with
individual loans.
"There is really no good resource for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> to get
assisted right now," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fedge</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linn Ledford</ENAMEX> ran a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> wholesale showroom and lived with his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> in a modest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that originally cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$19,500</NUMEX>. Thirty-one
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, their old neighborhood is being replaced by
sandstone-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">hued</ENAMEX> luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> encircling the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cherry Creek</ENAMEX> shopping
district.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ledfords</ENAMEX> expanded and refinanced their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> over time, once
to accommodate a grand piano that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linn</ENAMEX> played. But the series of
subprime loans that took them down what he calls "the slippery
slope" date to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, when he was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>.
He blames himself for their predicament, including the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fieldstone Mortgage</ENAMEX> loan he persuaded his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> to sign with her
good credit. "It's just my stupidity and lack of understanding what
could happen," he said. "I had no idea."
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fedge</ENAMEX> examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ledfords</ENAMEX>' recent mortgage loan history,
this is what he saw:
They refinanced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanta</ENAMEX>, a subprime lender
that charged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> interest. That loan raised their payments
to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,051</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 percent</NUMEX> of their current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>
income.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1999</TIMEX> they refinanced again with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Century Mortgage</ENAMEX>,
another subprime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lender</ENAMEX>. That lowered their interest rate to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
percent. But their principal balance jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$43,000 to $260,000</NUMEX>,
and their mortgage payments grew by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>, they refinanced with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fieldstone</ENAMEX>, getting
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost $70,000</NUMEX> for credit card debts, home improvements and the
growing gap between their expenses and income.
The new loan raised their mortgage debt <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$360,000</NUMEX>.
Its costs included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15,600</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> commissions and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9,234</NUMEX>
prepayment penalty to terminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Century</ENAMEX> loan. Their
interest rate climbed to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.5 percent</NUMEX>, and could go <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as 16.5</NUMEX>
percent. Their mortgage payments immediately jumped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,200</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>,
to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,290</NUMEX>.
All based on a nonexistent home quilting business.
A copy of the loan application shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryan Reilly</ENAMEX> listed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eileen Ledford</ENAMEX> as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The American Quilt</ENAMEX>. Her
supposed income: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$11,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ledfords</ENAMEX>' actual income:
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,431</NUMEX> a month from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> and a small annuity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fedge</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">broker</ENAMEX>'s misstatements unconscionable.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> does not deny putting information on the application form
that he knew was incorrect. But he said he thought the Ledfords
understood they could qualify only if he put down a "stated
income," typically an undocumented business income that raises the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">borrower</ENAMEX>'s interest rate. "I told them, "You <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> don't make enough
money,' " he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> also said he thought mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brokers</ENAMEX> commonly exaggerate
business proceeds in stated-income loans - "I would say <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX>
of the time they are padded" - adding that he was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> and
inexperienced at the time and has not repeated the mistake
since.
"I'm trying to get away from the mortgage industry" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>,
he said. "There's so much conflict in it, and there's not many
regulations."


<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Couple</ENAMEX> felt uninformed
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ledfords</ENAMEX> say they came away from a hurried loan closing
without understanding how much their mortgage payments would
increase or how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> had qualified them to borrow <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$360,000</NUMEX>.
They say they didn't know the application described <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eileen</ENAMEX> as a
quilting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fedge</ENAMEX> pointed it out. "That, I did not
see when I signed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>," she said. "I would have said,
"Whoa!' right away."
Their new loan has forced them to put their home up for sale. If
they sell it, they face another prepayment penalty of almost
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15,000</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fieldstone Mortgage</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fedge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Vasquez</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Legal Services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, assert
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fieldstone</ENAMEX> bears some responsibility for approving a loan
based on a suspiciously lucrative income from an elderly woman
selling quilts from her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. They asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fieldstone</ENAMEX> to trade a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deed</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60,000</NUMEX>, enough cash to let the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ledfords</ENAMEX> buy
a condo.
"I know that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fieldstone</ENAMEX> is interested in finding a workable
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam Bass</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, adding that
he can't comment on the details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ledford</ENAMEX> loan.
Meanwhile, the phone calls persist from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitors</ENAMEX> hoping to
refinance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ledfords</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> again.
"We get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least a dozen</NUMEX> calls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other day</TIMEX>," Eileen Ledford
said. "It feels like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>."
