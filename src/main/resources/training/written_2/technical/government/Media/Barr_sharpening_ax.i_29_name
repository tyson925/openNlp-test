<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> sharpening <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ax</ENAMEX> on legal aid to poor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melanie Eversley</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Washington Bureau</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 23</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> --- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that pays for legal
representation for the poor could be in trouble. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Barr</ENAMEX>, the
conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, is asking
questions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> thinks the private, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>-based non-profit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, which pays local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to represent the poor, is not
doing business the way it should. He has asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>
Accounting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> to conduct a probe.
"We want to know why there's no peer accounting system, why
there's no real method of competition for grants, and why meetings
are held in secret," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcommittee</ENAMEX> on
commercial and administrative law, which oversees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Corporation</ENAMEX>. Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX> is funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> through
an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> appropriation: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$329.3 million</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 2002</TIMEX>. In
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> channels funds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Program</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta Legal Aid Society</ENAMEX>.
Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> took over as the majority <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have charged that the LSC takes part in
political activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Meese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, is among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> who have pointed out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
demanded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> not do so.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Erlenborn</ENAMEX> recently testified to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> had instituted an oversight system run by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to ensure that its programs do not
violate the rule.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> has made every effort to ensure that the congressional
restrictions placed on grantees are strictly observed," Erlenborn
said.
"We pledge to continue working with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> to improve
the civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> delivery system in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>," he said, "and to
ensure federal dollars allocated for legal services are being spent
in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible."
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erlenborn</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had stipulated that LSC-funded
programs are forbidden from filing or litigating class-action
lawsuits, engaging in lobbying, litigating on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>,
or representing most undocumented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> say that the LSC-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> tend to defend
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved in leftist causes.
"Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX> that's in existence now
is dedicated to political activism and leftist causes, and,
sometimes, the representation of the poor," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd Gaziano</ENAMEX>,
senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> in legal studies at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaziano</ENAMEX> is working with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meese</ENAMEX> in opposing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX>.
"The representation of the poor is kind of low down on their
list of priorities," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaziano</ENAMEX> said.
"The current <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> has thumbed its nose at
congressional attempts to focus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX> on its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> of helping indigent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">litigants</ENAMEX> in certain types of
proceedings."
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> close to the case said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>
studies in the past have proved that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> is complying fully with
the congressional stipulations.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX> came about in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>. It is run by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">11member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> appointed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and confirmed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. No <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
the bipartisan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> can be from any one political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is expected to name new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> soon, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> said he would like to have an effect on those appointments. He
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> that he had sent a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
spelling out his questions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
"I'm not a fan of spending taxpayer dollars on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Corp.</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> said. "It could run on private contributions
and, if a state believes it ought to be involved, then through
state funds."
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> also said: "I don't think its realistic that we're
going to be able to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> it out. Therefore, we should at least make
it operate within the bounds of the law."
