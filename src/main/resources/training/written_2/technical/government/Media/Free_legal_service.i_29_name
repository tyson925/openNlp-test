Budget cut by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> vows central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> poor
will not be left in lurch

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 30, 2002</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEORIA - Prairie State Legal Services Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peoria</ENAMEX> managing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Y. Wilson</ENAMEX> vows that poor central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinoisans</ENAMEX> will
continue to have free <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to assist them, despite funding
cuts.
"There has been a decrease in funding to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prairie State</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $50,000</NUMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>. "That means
that we will lose money to supply one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>, but we should be
able to continue to manage. It's not having the impact as it is
having in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>" and at other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> statewide.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">331</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fulton St.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Suite 600</ENAMEX>, serves poor
residents in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peoria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tazewell, Woodford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stark</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> learned from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Kleiman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corp.</ENAMEX> - the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that distributes federal
money for free legal aid programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> - that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> will lose
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $920,000</NUMEX> in congressional funding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>.
Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prairie State</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> also funds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Assistance</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alton</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land of Lincoln</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>.
The cuts will take the biggest bite out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land of Lincoln</ENAMEX>, a
network of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> who help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern Illinois</ENAMEX> with problems such as eviction, access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> and obtaining orders of protection from abusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleiman</ENAMEX> said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> allocates money to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> based on the number of poor
counted in the last census. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> census showed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> with
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 35,000</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are eligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> services.
Although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> groups deliver most of the legal aid in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of other programs offer similar services, and all
will feel the pain when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois</ENAMEX> doles
out grants for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>.
The fund, created by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Supreme Court</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, gets
interest from escrow accounts and other money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> often keep
for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and spends it on legal aid. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, the fund
will likely award <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.5 million</NUMEX> it usually gives
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> statewide, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Ann Schmitt</ENAMEX>, the trust funds
executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois General Assembly</ENAMEX> has appropriated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $500,000</NUMEX>
annually for legal aid in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, an amount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartylak</ENAMEX> said has
not been much reduced. Still, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> most populated
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> ranks last in the amount of money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>
appropriate for legal aid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Erlenborn</ENAMEX> said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peoria County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">State</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Lyons</ENAMEX> said all the budget
cuts will not affect poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> because the state court
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">appoints</ENAMEX> public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX>.
