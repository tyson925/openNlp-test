<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lawyer Praised for Raising the Bar on Donations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lalley</ENAMEX> appealed to area <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to give more time and
money to the poor. This
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, they gave morethan a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">half million dollars</NUMEX> to Western
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Legal Services</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank Bornheimer</ENAMEX> / The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX> Press
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lalley Jr.</ENAMEX> has never been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>.
His middle-class upbringing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the '50s</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">'60s</ENAMEX> produced a
comfortable, secure childhood. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> of an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and a full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homemaker</ENAMEX>, he was educated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX>
Central
High <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">School</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Michigan University</ENAMEX> and had a
promising
career, with a law degree from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of North</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX>.
He has practiced law <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 years</TIMEX> now, and he makes a good
living.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lalley</ENAMEX> knows the poor.
Like many local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>, he has donated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX> of free
legal
help over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>. But it was his influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapids Bar Association</ENAMEX> to increase their financial and legal
support
for the poor that earned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX> kudos for saving Western
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX> (WMLS) from near collapse.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Michigan Legal Services</ENAMEX> formerly known as the non-profit
Legal Aid, honored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX> recently with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th</TIMEX> annual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnes Award</ENAMEX> for "outstanding service to the low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> call it "pro bono" work, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> phrase meaning, "For the
public good."
In praising <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lalley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMLS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Chielens</ENAMEX> said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pro</ENAMEX>
bono
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> perform a necessary service to society by increasing
access
to justice for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, not just those who have the
wealth."
A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-founder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verspoor, Waalkes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lalley</ENAMEX>, a
small law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trust Building</ENAMEX> downtown, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lalley</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>, said, he
doesn't regard his own public service as anything special. "It just
levels the playing field for them," he said. "They're just cases of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who need help, but have no idea where to turn. It's not
always for legal issues."
It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after the ceremony and, modesty aside, he was
feeling pleased about the award.
"It's nice to receive, knowing what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Barnes</ENAMEX>
was. The previous winners were all quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>."
The late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Barnes</ENAMEX>, a corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>, and the legendary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cummiskey</ENAMEX>, a labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>'s side, are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> also were well known
in the local and state legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> for their heart and hard work
for the poor.
While he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bar Association</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995- 96</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX> decided to make legal services to the poor a top
priority.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>, had cut federal funding for such
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX> suffered a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX>
reduction.
Lalley remembers calling a meeting of managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> of all
the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">law firms</ENAMEX> in town to deal with the cutback. He appealed to
them to get their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> to restore the loss out of their own
pockets. He also asked that local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> double the time they gave
to the poor.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Bar Association</ENAMEX> guidelines encouraged but never
mandated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 hours a year</TIMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>.
"I simply told them we needed funds, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX> would have
been gutted," Lalley remembers of that meeting. "I asked for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300</NUMEX>
per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> to make up for the shortfall. Just about everyone came
through, and they're still doing it."
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> gave <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than a half million dollars</NUMEX> in time
and money to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMLS</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Abrahamsen</ENAMEX>, pro bono <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX> also is enthused about other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> efforts on behalf of the
poor, most notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Assistance Center</ENAMEX> will operate out of
the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> will be staffed by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Michigan Legal Services</ENAMEX> and a rotation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, spearheaded by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Muth</ENAMEX>,
appears to be unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lalley</ENAMEX> said.
"The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> raised <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over a million dollars</NUMEX> to fund the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>." The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> awarded a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6,000</NUMEX> grant for the model
project.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX> has a general law practice, handling most cases, from
family matters to liability lawsuits.
"I like the variety. There always will be a need for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>
to do general law. I probably could still pass the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">state</ENAMEX>) bar
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exam</ENAMEX>," he says, somewhat in jest, because of all the different
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of the law still very familiar to him.
Lalley, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Verspoor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Waalkes</ENAMEX> have been law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, and together since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> when they were beginning
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> with another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>. "We've always gotten along," says
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX>.
He spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his first year</TIMEX> out of law school as a law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Rapids</ENAMEX>. The job was typically
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">low-paying</ENAMEX>. He and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX>, probably didn't
know they were starting out on the poor side. They got married
after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his first year</TIMEX> of law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appeals</ENAMEX> court job changed their plans to settle in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lansing</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">halfway</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between</TIMEX> here and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saginaw</ENAMEX>, where she grew up.
He still gives time to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar association</ENAMEX>, serving on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bono Committee</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> should fade away."
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lalley</ENAMEX> praises the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> working for Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>. "They are the ones who are really dedicated to helping
the poor."
Of his own contribution to the poor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lalley</ENAMEX> sums it up this way:
"I managed to shut down a few crises in their lives."
