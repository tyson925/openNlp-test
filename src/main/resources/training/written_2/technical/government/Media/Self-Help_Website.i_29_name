A decrease in the number of poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> means there will
be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> less in federal legal-aid money for the state next
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>.
"A bit of good news: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>'s poverty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> decreased
significantly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>," said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mauricio Vivero</ENAMEX>, vice president
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX>
"There are now <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just over 1 million</NUMEX> poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> who
qualify for our services. The bad news is your federal funding for
civil equal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> will also decrease."
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Corp.</ENAMEX> is the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that disperses <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$330</NUMEX>
million that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> allocates for federal legal aid. The money is
allotted based on poverty population figures that are updated every
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Census</ENAMEX>.
Vivero was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> to announce a new federal technology
grant designed to help low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ohioans</ENAMEX> gain access to the civil
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX> system.
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rep.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Pryce</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Legal Services</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>
will receive a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200,000</NUMEX> federal grant toward an online legal
self-help <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> will be able to download <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> forms and other documents
specific to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> in which they live from the Web site, said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pryce</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Arlington</ENAMEX>.
"<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> already has a domestic-violence resource center online at
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osla</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org</ENAMEX>, where domestic-violence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> can go and file for
restraining orders and get linked up to a domestic shelter," said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Kleiman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesman</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX>
"They are going to be expanding that kind of service to other
legal matters with this grant. This specific piece should be up by
fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>."
The technology being pioneered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> is a pilot program that
eventually will be used nationwide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleiman</ENAMEX> said.
