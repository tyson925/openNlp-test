<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deconcini</ENAMEX> was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>'s early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>'s celebration was the first public even held at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courthouse</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> attended,

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Zlaket</ENAMEX>.
Both grants come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services.</ENAMEX>, a private, nonprofit
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corporation</ENAMEX> established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> to offer poor people
equal access to the justice system. It's funded through
congressional appropriation.
The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.6 million</NUMEX> grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web
site, which will be created with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50,000</NUMEX> grant, is intended to
offer legal advice to poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Julian</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief executive officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Arizona Legal Aid</ENAMEX>. He said he
wants every poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> to have legal help.
"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we
do a pretty good job of helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who find us," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julian</ENAMEX>
said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julian</ENAMEX> said that though most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not own computers, they
can still access them at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouses</ENAMEX>. He
said the Web site will help bridge the "digital divide" that keeps
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> from using the Internet as a resource.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Arizona Legal Aid</ENAMEX> was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Aid</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society of the Pima County Bar Association</ENAMEX>. It offered free legal
advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court,
divorce proceedings and obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> benefits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Ares</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>,
said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> was kind of a charity operation. . . . a bare bones
operation" in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX>.
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> and volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> help <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 12,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine</TIMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> runs a toll free <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Elder</ENAMEX> Hotline for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> and
older. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has received national acclaim for advocating
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Indian</ENAMEX> causes and efforts to protect battered immigrant
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffers</ENAMEX> and volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribal</ENAMEX>, state and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Organizers</ENAMEX> said the anniversary is particularly sweet because
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> has survived federal funding crises while similar
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> have not. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> cut <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of funding to
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Corp.</ENAMEX>, which caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Arizona Legal Aid</ENAMEX> to
lose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly a quarter</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 million</NUMEX> operating budget.
