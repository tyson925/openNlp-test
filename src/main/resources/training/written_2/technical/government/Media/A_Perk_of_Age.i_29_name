A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perk</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Legal Advice</ENAMEX>
By <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kelly Greene</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Legal</ENAMEX> advice is only a phone call away - and the hot lines
that provide it are expanding their services.
It's a little known perk available to anyone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 or older</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> operate legal-assistance
hot lines for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and most take calls from younger
caregivers as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volunteers</ENAMEX> offer advice on legal questions,
provide self-help materials, and make referrals to legal aid
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and pro bono or reduced-fee private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. Even if you
live in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> without a hot line, local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> on aging will
provide you with referrals to nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. The hot lines and
referral services tackle estate planning, pension, and health
benefits, elder abuse and neglect, guardianship custodial issues
involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX>, consumer protection and other elder-law
issues.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> on Aging coordinates this loosely knit
legal-services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Anyone who meets the age requirement can
call the hot line, but hands-on legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> goes <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to people
with the greatest financial or social needs. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX>
recently awarded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> in grants to improve elder-law
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>, with the largest part being used to bolster <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> hotlines
around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, some of which are adding Web-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">questionnaires</ENAMEX> and outreach projects in rural areas and for older
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who don't speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
For a list of where the hotlines operate, along with their phone
numbers and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, go to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aoa</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gov/legal/hotline.</ENAMEX>html, or call
the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eldercare Locator</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800-677-1116</ENAMEX>. If you live in a
state without a hot line, the locator can point you to local legal
assistance.
Another source of low-cost help also expanded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AARP</ENAMEX>'s
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Network</ENAMEX> is now available in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and expects to
reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 50</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of March</TIMEX>. You have to pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s dues
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>) to use the services; after that you get <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> of
legal counseling, either face-to-face or by phone, at no cost.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lawyers</ENAMEX> discount their usual rate by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> after that. Simple wills
cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$75</NUMEX> apiece. You can reach the service at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800-424-3410</ENAMEX> or go to
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aarp</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">org/LSN</ENAMEX> to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> nearby.
