alleges laws violated
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman Cornelius</ENAMEX>
The farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> said they knew they had breathed poison moments
after a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>-duster buzzed nearby, spraying a field of sweet corn
with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mites</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>.
Most of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> migrant farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, in an adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX>
field in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Olathe</ENAMEX>, said they felt sick immediately: They gasped for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">breath</ENAMEX>, had pounding headaches, irritated eyes and swollen, numb
tongues. Some vomited as a cloud of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> settled on
fields around them.
The farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> said they
left the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> when sprayed, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreman</ENAMEX> ordered them to
continue working, saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>-duster had released a harmless
solution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
A new study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Legal Services</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of its kind in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky Mountain</ENAMEX> region, says such migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> at farms
statewide are regularly exposed to hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> in
violation of federal laws.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that hired the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Olathe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> whose land they were working have denied any role in making
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> sick.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, talking about their incident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>,
said their experience illustrates the problems.
'We were cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX>, and we saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> coming. It was
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spraying</ENAMEX>, and the wind was blowing, so it blew toward us,' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blanca Chavez</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>, who sought <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> in a portable toilet. 'We
ingested it. It was like a fog.'
Another farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcelina Lopez</ENAMEX>, was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> pregnant during the reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olathe</ENAMEX> spraying incident on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 29</TIMEX>. She developed stomach cramps and a rash on her belly and
arms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lopez</ENAMEX> said as she and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> others on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> crew
discussed the incident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lopez</ENAMEX> saw a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> after the spraying, but that
heightened her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.
'The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> couldn't tell if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> was affected,' her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. 'We worry a lot because we don't know if the baby
will be affected.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Dorsey</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cactus</ENAMEX> Produce - the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scottsdale</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, farm-labor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> that employs the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> - said company
policy requires that incidents of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticide</ENAMEX> exposure be reported
immediately. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew supervisors</ENAMEX> did not report what workers
described. Lacking field or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> reports, he questioned
whether the incident occurred.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grower Tom Humphrey</ENAMEX> also was skeptical.
'I think this is a crock,' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphrey</ENAMEX>, a vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>. 'You're listening to somebody who wants money for
nothing.'
Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> took her case to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Legal Services</ENAMEX>, a
nonprofit law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> that represents low-income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> in civil
cases around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. She and the other farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> said they
agreed to publicly discuss the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olathe</ENAMEX> incident to illustrate the
hazards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> face in the fields and to push <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> to abide by
pesticide-safety laws.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chavez</ENAMEX>'s case mirrors the findings of the survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>
Legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX>, which reports that migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> at farms
statewide are regularly exposed to hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> in
violation of federal laws.
The exposure comes from chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in farm
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fields</ENAMEX> and from pesticide drift, such as the incidents lettuce
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> described, according to the survey.
Legal Services conducted interviews with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88</TIMEX> farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in some
of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>'s most abundant agricultural regions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and
found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of those surveyed had experienced symptoms of
pesticide exposure. The symptoms included skin rash, inflamed eyes,
headaches and irritation of the nose and throat.
Those surveyed worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Weld County</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas Valley</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Luis Valley</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Slope</ENAMEX> and took part in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX>
interviews at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>-labor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX> in those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimi Jackson</ENAMEX>, author of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Legal Services</ENAMEX> study, said
the surveys were detailed and the responses consistent across the
state.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">'It</ENAMEX>'s striking that so many farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> report experiencing
symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticide</ENAMEX> exposure,' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s pesticide project. 'Imagine in your own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> if half the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> had experienced symptoms like that. That's very high.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Christensen</ENAMEX>, executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Farm</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> consider pesticide
safety important for themselves and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, in part
because they want to maintain a productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> and avoid
liability.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Pesticides</ENAMEX> can be very injurious if they are not handled
properly. I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> realize that,'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christensen</ENAMEX> said.
Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services</ENAMEX> report faults <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX>, farm-labor
contractors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>-dusters for routinely failing to abide by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal</ENAMEX> regulations meant to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> health.
The study also demands that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Environmental Protection</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX> better enforce the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10- year-old</TIMEX> laws, collectively called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worker Protection</ENAMEX>
Standard.
The laws require that farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> be prevented from entering
fields treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> until recommended times have
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elapsed</ENAMEX>. The laws also mandate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> be trained in pesticide
safety, are notified of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> that have been sprayed, have fresh
water to wash <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> from their skin and receive emergency
medical help in cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticide</ENAMEX> exposure or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> records show <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> regularly fail to follow the
rules.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> inspected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">farms</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> failed to fully comply with federal laws meant to
protect farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Osag</ENAMEX>, an enforcement
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> got warning letters and will be inspected
again, he said.
'Workers were not being trained. There was no central location
where the required information was being posted, and several of
them did not have decontamination supplies,' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britta Campbell</ENAMEX>,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> who conducted most of the farm
inspections.
'Obviously we have a regulation which is not being followed,'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osag</ENAMEX> said. 'There is a potential that we're exposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> to
increased health risks.'
Migrant farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,000 to 40,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, according
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Labor</ENAMEX> - are critical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.23</NUMEX>
billion agriculture industry. They travel from farm to farm,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tending</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">harvesting fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>.
Farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> earn an average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.15</NUMEX> an hour for jobs that
often require fieldwork from sunup to sundown during the growing
season, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> said.
Many migrant farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are reluctant to report pesticide
problems because they fear they will lose their jobs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX>
said.
'We do the work in the fields because we don't have a lot of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>, and in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> you need to have an education to
have a good job. We don't feel like we have any options,' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Figeroa</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> reportedly overcome
by pesticide drift in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Olathe</ENAMEX>.
She and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew members</ENAMEX> spoke in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX> through an
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interpreter</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pesticides</ENAMEX>, widely used to increase crop yields, have become a
leading health concern among migrant farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. Coloring books
distributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Weld County</ENAMEX> warn
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> to run when they see <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>-dusters spraying
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'pesticidas</ENAMEX>.'
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cesar Chavez</ENAMEX> fasted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36 days</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to
underscore the dangers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> to farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and their
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. It was the last and longest fast for the 61-year-old
civil-rights <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activist</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The following year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chavez</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Farm Workers</ENAMEX>,
released a seminal study addressing the health effects of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> on farmworkers. The report, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'Fields of Poison</ENAMEX>,' found
that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmworkers</ENAMEX> face greater risk of pesticide
poisoning than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and are not
adequately protected.
Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> report, it called for stronger enforcement of
existing laws.
Little research has been conducted on the long-term health
effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX> on farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.
But some research points to danger: A study published earlier
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Journal of Industrial Medicine</ENAMEX> found that
migrant farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, most of them <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>, have a
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 percent</NUMEX> higher risk of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> than other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX>
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
Field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69 percent</NUMEX> higher risk for stomach <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>.
Male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> also have a higher chance of developing brain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
while female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> have a higher risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uterine cancer</ENAMEX>,
according to the study, which linked the risks to pesticide
exposure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> compared farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Farm Workers</ENAMEX>
with that from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Cancer Registry</ENAMEX>.
It is hard to prove that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> illness is a result of pesticide
exposure in the field because other things, both on and off the
job, can trigger physical symptoms, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne Wuerthele</ENAMEX>, an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toxicologist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>.
Yet <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of chemicals commonly used to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> on agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> can cause immediate sickness in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who inhale, swallow or absorb them through skin contact,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuerthele</ENAMEX> said.
Recent research raises questions about the connection between
pesticide exposure and long-term health problems, such as chronic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headaches</ENAMEX>, sleep disorders, vision problems, nerve damage, cancer
and birth defects, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wuerthele</ENAMEX> said.
'These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> are always dangerous to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. That's why they
have to be used correctly,' she said. 'They are designed to kill
things, and they can be toxic to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chavez</ENAMEX> said she called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Legal Services</ENAMEX> because she felt
sick and did not know where to turn.
'They're not worms,' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guierrmo Othon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chavez</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, who
is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>. 'These are human lives.'
