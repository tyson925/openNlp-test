Intervening with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcohol Problems</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency Settings</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo C. DiClemente</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PhD* Carl Soderstrom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>
Excessive alcohol consumption plays an important role in many of
the medical conditions, accidents, and injuries that cause visits
to emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. Many studies have
documented the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to
emergency depart<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-ment1-5</ENAMEX> and trauma center6,7 settings. Other
studies have demonstrated that even blood alcohol concentration
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX>) determinations under-estimate the extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are triaged and treated in emergency
settings<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4,7</NUMEX> The prevalence of this co-factor to the emergency
admission, and the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is a risk factor both for the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> visit and for a return visit to the emergency setting, have
occasioned a call for an effective method of intervening with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems in these settings<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> Although there are problems
with and barriers to intervening in these settings, a number of
studies and a few controlled trials indicate that interventions
focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' drinking can reduce the amount of drinking as
well as injury episodes, including repeat re-admission for injury
and other negative consequences of drinking. This review will
examine the rationale for intervening, types of interventions and
interveners, and barriers and concerns that need to be addressed.
Then we will offer suggestions for research and practice related to
intervening effectively with alcohol problems in emergency
settings.
Motivational considerations
The rationale for interventions in the emergency setting is that
the medical condition or injury prompting admission provides a
"window of opportunity" when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> may be more vulnerable
and more open to seeing the connection between current consequences
and his or her drinking or drug abuse and may be more motivated to
change<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
* <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presenter</ENAMEX>
The presence of an adverse consequence that can be linked to
drinking-such as gastrointestinal, vascular, renal, or other
medical problem; an automobile crash; unintentional injury; or
involvement in a violent incident-facilitates intervention among
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with alcohol problems encountered in the emergency
setting. In an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>) study of injured crash
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> who had been drinking, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cherpitel</ENAMEX> found that more than
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> linked their drinking to being injured and thus were
deemed good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for "brief intervention."16 In another study
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sommers</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">colleagues15</TIMEX> involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trauma centers</ENAMEX>, patients
who were injured in vehicular crashes and had a positive BAC were
asked, "To what extent do you believe your alcohol consumption was
responsible for this injury<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> attributed being injured
either "somewhat" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>) or "mostly" or "totally" (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>) to be the
result of drinking. This attribution may be less endorsed with
medical conditions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">liver disease</ENAMEX> or pancreatitis.
Whether this awareness is viewed as a "hitting bottom"
phenomenon or in more traditional motivational terms, there does
seem to be a connection between readiness to change and recognition
that negative consequences can be directly linked to a behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX>
Reports from emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and anecdotal descriptions of some
interventions support the results of the above studies, indicating
heightened motivation in the initial period of time in the
emergency setting. However, it is not clear how long this initial
openness to change lasts. There are also reports that after a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of days</TIMEX>, spurred by concerns about legal responsibility,
family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> advice, or rationalizations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> openness to
discuss drinking and other problem behaviors decreases
dramatically.
We do know that alcohol consumption changes for many problem
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drinkers</ENAMEX> after their visit to an emergency setting. Several studies
have documented consumption changes not only in the intervention
condition but also in the minimal intervention control groups<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18,19</NUMEX>
However, changes in alcohol consumption are often not sustained
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in control conditions. After the emergency
visit, there seems to be a reduction in drinking that gradually
returns to baseline problematic levels for many untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
Changes in drinking that are produced simply by the visit to the
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> seem to dissipate without an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>-specific
intervention<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> Although there may be some
natural or unaided salutary effect on drinking resulting from
the medical emergency or injury and the ensuing visit to the
emergency setting<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,20</NUMEX> that effect appears to be short-lived for many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX>-injury and readmission to an emergency or other medical
setting is much greater for problem drinkers than for other
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.12 It is clear from the literature that without
some intervention that can facilitate enduring reductions in
drinking, simply giving medical treatment alone to the problem
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drinker</ENAMEX> admitted to the emergency setting will not reduce the rates
of re-admission or prevent re-injury related to alcohol
consumption. Although it is still not clear what the nature and
extent of the intervention must be, some type of intervention
specifically for drinking needs to be given.
Interventions in the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>: a review
Various types of interventions have been proposed and examined
for the emergency medical setting (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). These range from
brief interventions delivered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> to more extensive
counseling during the admission that includes referral to intensive
treatment after discharge. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> conducted a
pilot intervention at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> that consisted
of a substance abuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselor</ENAMEX> mobilizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and at times
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>, to intervene with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s drinking and to
arrange for immediate entry to a residential substance abuse
treatment program after discharge. This program appeared to be
successful in getting problem-drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to treatment, but
only with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who could be engaged and for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> or insurance.21 This and other seminal studies encouraged
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> to call for some type of consultation service or
brief intervention to be employed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in emergency rooms
or trauma settings<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13,22</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
Many of the early studies that documented the efficacy of
interventions with problem drinkers in emergency settings were
evaluations and not controlled studies. Nevertheless, the
documented outcomes have been impressive. Several studies have
examined the outcomes achieved by substance abuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> intervening with problem drinkers. A brief
intervention in an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> by alcohol health workers
demonstrated a mean reduction in drinking of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX> for a subset of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were enrolled in the study.26 The pilot
program in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> described above demonstrated a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> successful
referral to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who
agreed to be in the program<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX> A substance abuse consultation team
in a trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> reported acceptance of referral for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> treatment in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> consecutive cases
retrospectively evaluated<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemphill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watkins</ENAMEX>
reported successful referral of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to treatment with nearly
half of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">440</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> referred for treatment remaining for the
duration of the treatment program<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">.28 Early</TIMEX> reports of screening and
referral of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have been promising in terms of reduction in
drinking or in successful connection with appropriate alcohol
treatment programs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29,30</NUMEX> For the most part, these interventions
have used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> concentration as one of the critical
defining features in screening for the intervention.
Interventions for drinking problems have also been successful in
reducing re-injury. In a recent review of intervention trials for
problem drinking that measured injury outcomes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dinh-Zarr</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> studies that measured injury outcomes
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in a variety of settings. They reported that
reductions in a variety of injuries, injury hospitalizations, and
deaths ranged from a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27%</NUMEX> reduction in "drinking-related injuries
and accidents" to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX> reduction in "accidental and violent
deaths."31 However, in this review there was no clear evidence that
the mechanism of action of these interventions was reduced alcohol
consumption. These interventions appeared to affect risk taking in
addition to or instead of reductions in drinking and included
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who had legal charges pending. Most of the studies
reviewed were not well controlled and the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
and effect sizes reported in these studies were modest.
Until recently, no well-controlled intervention studies have
addressed whether interventions in emergency settings would reduce
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumption and consequences. Several current publications
have begun to remedy this lack of prospective, randomized trials.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harborview Medical Center</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, conducted a randomized controlled trial in a
Level I trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who screened positive on a
combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> concentration (BAC), serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMAST</ENAMEX> scores, and who agreed to
a follow-up study, were randomized into an intervention or control
procedure. The intervention was a single motivational interview
that lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 30 minutes</TIMEX> with
a doctoral-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> trained and certified in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motivational</ENAMEX> interviewing techniques. A letter was sent summarizing
this session <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month later</TIMEX>. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">366</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were randomly
assigned to the intervention condition, but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 15%</NUMEX> of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were discharged before the intervention could be given,
and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 2%</NUMEX> refused the intervention. At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-month</TIMEX> follow-up,
the intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> demonstrated an average reduction in
drinking of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> compared with a reduction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> per week for the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Most of the drinking
reduction occurred among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with mild to moderate alcohol
problems and not in the heaviest drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subgroup</ENAMEX>. There were also
significant reductions in new injuries of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50%</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> and
a reduction in inpatient hospital re-admissions for injury
treatment of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> follow-up. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest
that this type of intervention alone is insufficient for patients
with more chronic and severe alcohol dependence. Another limitation
of this seminal study is that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were lost to
follow-up at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX>. However, this trial demonstrates that a
rather brief intervention delivered by a trained professional in
the emergency setting can produce significant reductions in
drinking and repeat injury episodes.
A controlled trial of a similar motivational intervention with
older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 18 to 19 years</TIMEX> treated in an emergency room
following an alcohol-related event randomly assigned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">184</NUMEX>
eligible patients<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were assigned to a motivational
intervention or a standard control of a handout about drinking and
driving and a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. The intervention,
which lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 to 40 minutes</TIMEX>, was delivered in the emergency
department either immediately or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a couple of days</TIMEX> of the
visit. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 25%</NUMEX> of the eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were discharged before
the intervention and another <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> refused to participate.
Nevertheless, drinking and driving, moving violations,
alcohol-related injuries, and alcohol-related problems were
significantly reduced at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six-month</TIMEX> follow up, with the
intervention group experiencing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third to one-half</NUMEX> fewer events
than the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Although drinking decreased over time for
both intervention and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, their drinking levels were
not significantly different. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bachelor</ENAMEX>'s or master's level staff
with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>' of experience and extensive motivational
interview training delivered this intervention.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Follow-up</ENAMEX> was limited to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>, so this study would have
missed any rebound back to baseline at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later time</TIMEX> points, and the
refusal rate was rather high in this study. However, the evidence
was strong for a harm reduction effect across various indicators of
risk and re-injury.
Who delivers what type of intervention
Most of the interventions described previously were conducted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> trained in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> or substance abuse counseling or in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motivational</ENAMEX> interviewing techniques. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> met
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, discussed drinking and substance use openly and
directly, and offered some advice and assistance. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Substance</ENAMEX> abuse
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX> typically offered advice and referrals to treatment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> or self-help programs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motivational</ENAMEX> interview counselors
typically discussed the perceived consequences, readiness to
change, pros and cons of change, and plans to reduce drinking and
avoid alcohol-related injuries in the future. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Substance</ENAMEX> abuse
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type or another typically delivered drinking
interventions in emergency settings with a few exceptions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29,30</NUMEX> No
studies have compared different types of intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> in
these settings.
In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> in a variety of primary care
settings have delivered brief alcohol-focused interventions. These
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX> also appear to be effective in reducing drinking and
risky behaviors<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20,32,33 One</NUMEX> recent study demonstrated that a
brief, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>-centered alcohol counseling intervention delivered
in the context of a regularly scheduled internal medicine visit
produced significant reductions in alcohol consumption among both
male and female high-risk drinkers<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX> Based on these interventions
in other medical settings, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have recommended
the involvement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> in the emergency setting in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intervention<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9,26,35,36</NUMEX> However, few studies of
physician-delivered interventions in an emergency setting exist.
Clearly, none of the extant studies could be done without the
support and involvement of emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and trauma
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeons</ENAMEX>. However, it may be difficult to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to deliver
these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>-focused interventions for a variety of practical,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">philosophical</ENAMEX>, orientation, and training reasons.
To some degree, all interventions described in the emergency
setting are motivational. Each intervention attempts to highlight
problematic alcohol consumption, the connection between injury and
drinking,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> plans to address excessive drinking. Prototypic
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> abuse interventions focus on motivation to enter
treatment because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are severely dependent, heavy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drinkers</ENAMEX>. Referral to "appropriate" treatment is the critical end
point of this type of intervention and compliance with the referral
the important outcome. Change of drinking and risky behaviors is
left to the treatment program, and almost always, abstinence from
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is the goal of these treatment programs.37 On the other
hand, motivational interviewing approaches view change as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> and responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and work with the
individual at whatever level of motivation or stage of change is
appropriate to promote consideration of change and an
individualized plan of action that does not necessarily include
additional treatment or self-help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcoholics Anonymous</ENAMEX>.
Brief motivational interventions have been used with a wide range
of problem drinkers and have been found to be effective in reducing
drinking and its consequences<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38</NUMEX> Goals for this treatment are
articulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">client</ENAMEX> and can include reduction as well as
abstinence from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>.
Nearly all interventions delivered in emergency settings consist
of a single intervention visit. It is difficult to prescribe
multiple visits unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> from
the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> or has an extended stay in a trauma
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have suggested that the follow-up visit to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> for extended treatment would be the best place for
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> interventions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.25</NUMEX> However, postponing intervention to the
follow-up visit poses great logistical problems. Scheduling of
follow-up visits depends on type of medical problem or injury.
Moreover, these visits are not consistently attended by the patient
or delivered by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in the
initial visit to the emergency setting. Although many single-visit
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol interventions</ENAMEX> in medical settings have been effective<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,32</NUMEX>
the context of the emergency setting does increase the importance
of considering follow through after the initial contact. Gentilello
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> sent a letter home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> after discharge as a
reminder of the intervention conversation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> A currently funded
trial at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> is using a feedback letter and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more follow-up
phone calls to extend the intervention beyond the emergency setting
interview. This extension into the post-discharge period is most
relevant for interventions that do not rely completely
on referral to treatment. However, post-discharge follow-up
could also be used to solve problems related to treatment
recommendations and enhance compliance with the
recommendations.
Issues and challenges for interventions in emergency
settings
Substantial evidence indicates that interventions with problem
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">drinkers</ENAMEX> in emergency settings can produce significant change in
drinking behavior and/or reduce risk of re-injury. The number of
studies that have demonstrated effects either with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteer</ENAMEX> or
randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> is modest but increasing, and the effects
range from minimal to very sizeable reduction in risks that have
significant public health importance. Evaluation and referral
interventions have been able to get a number of emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and trauma center <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> into alcoholism
treatment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29,30</NUMEX> It is not always clear whether there were long-term
positive outcomes from these trials since referral has been the
outcome variable most often studied. However, one can assume that
some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> referred to treatment had very positive outcomes in
terms of reductions in drinking and of risk profiles. Motivational
interventions in emergency settings have more recently demonstrated
important clinical outcomes in terms of risk-taking, negative
consequences of drinking, and, at times, reductions in
drink-ing<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18,19</NUMEX> The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> who were not screened,
who refused, who were discharged early, or who were ineligible was
large in some studies. However, when the intervention was delivered
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in emergency settings and compared with standard or
minimal interventions, intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had significantly
better outcomes on relevant measures. It is important to note that
minimal interventions are not insignificant since they include, of
necessity, an assessment of drinking behavior and a follow-up
contact, and they are often much more than ordinarily occurs in the
emergency setting. Screening or assessment alone, however, does not
appear to be as effective as some type of specific
intervention.
Bringing research to practice
This review of interventions, focused on addressing alcohol
problems among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in various medical settings, highlights
several important issues and offers a perspective on the challenges
to creating sustained, effective intervention programs in the
emergency setting. Strategies and
insights from clinical trials should be gathered and made
available to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> to help every emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and
trauma center implement a coordinated, effective, and feasible
program of screening and intervention for problem drinkers.
However, several conceptual and practical issues need to be
clarified so they can be resolved in a future research and
implementation agenda.
Although an opportunity exists to intervene with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use problems, and there are published guidelines for
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> concerning intervention,
that opportunity has not been seized<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8,9,35,39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> noted that although "trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> are uniquely
positioned to implement pro-<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">grams</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> screening,
intervention, and referral," and "despite emphasis on injury
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> and prevention, little has been done to incorporate alcohol
intervention programs into care of the injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>."10 This
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> was based in part on the results of a national survey
of trauma centers which revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> testing, which
is often a precursor for any intervention, was routinely conducted
at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 64%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> despite a published guideline by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons</ENAMEX> indicating
that testing was an "essential" characteristic for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.40
The survey also found that although <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> had
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> abuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5%</NUMEX> used screening questionnaires
to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use problems.
Although we know of no studies assessing clinical practices
regarding alcohol problems in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, a survey of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,055</NUMEX> emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> found
that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> favored testing and reporting injured,
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>-impaired drivers<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.41</NUMEX> However, ambivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> were
revealed concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alcoholics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>. On a scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
(strongly disagree) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7</NUMEX> (strongly agree) the statement "alcoholics
are difficult to treat" received a mean score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.25</NUMEX>, and the
statement "<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> is a treat-able disease" received a mean
score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.27</NUMEX>. In an earlier report, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astrachan</ENAMEX> documented
low BAC testing rates for intoxicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> by emergency
department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>.42 One of the reasons they cited was
"defeatism about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>." In a recent survey of
emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX> agreed that alcohol
abuse/dependence is a "treatable <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>," but <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 90%</NUMEX>
indicated that there was a lack of time to perform interventions,
and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 51%</NUMEX> supported
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> interventions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.43</NUMEX> These attitudes and
practices are similar to those found in a national survey of
physicians practicing internal medicine, family medicine,
obstetrics-gynecology, and psychia-try<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX> Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> reported
asking about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use but few used recommended screening
protocols or offered formal treatment.
The first challenge for implementing recommended screening and
interventions for problem drinking in emergency settings involves
convincing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> of the importance and efficacy of such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. Although the research to date supports the efficacy
of these interventions, clinical trials are needed to confirm these
findings and to set the stage for the next logical step of
effectiveness studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feasibility</ENAMEX> and successful dissemination
must be demonstrated. Prototype interventions that can reach the
majority of problem drinkers, motivate them to change drinking
patterns or enter appropriate treatment, and produce positive
long-term outcomes should be introduced into several emergency
settings of differing size and staff composition. These multi-site
effectiveness studies can then be used to promote change in
standard practice in all emergency settings.
What we have learned from the research to date gives us some
direction as to how to implement interventions in emergency
settings to reduce drinking and alcohol related risks. The first
step to developing an effective and efficient intervention program
would be to create a screening procedure integrated into the
admission and triage system of the emergency settings. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX>
problems can be identified along a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use and
consequences. However, it is important to clarify what type of
problem interveners are attempting to address. The screening
procedure can have a net with larger or smaller mesh that can be
set for more or less severe alcohol problems. However, whatever the
titration of the screen, the procedure must be clearly delineated
and uniformly applied to every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> admitted to the emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> or trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The primary screen must be integrated
into the standard intake procedure of the emergency setting and
must be the responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to administer to all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
This preliminary screen should trigger a more in-depth
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX> and a brief intervention that can be delivered either
separately or as a package (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The assessment is critical
for evaluating motivation
and decisional considerations and for determining the need for
and appropriateness of referrals to treatment. The success of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motivational</ENAMEX> and patient-centered approaches seems to indicate that
it is critical to take into account the motivation of the patient
and his or her readiness to change<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24,25</NUMEX> Once motivated, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> may need a variety of options depending on the nature of
the alcohol problem and the needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Many treatment
providers believe that intensity of treatment should be determined
by level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problem, although controlled trials do not
always support the assumption. Greater dependence and,
particularly, greater support for drinking in the environment, may
indicate a need for more intensive treatment, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detoxification</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inpatient</ENAMEX> or residential treatment, or intensive
day treatment. Self-help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcoholics Anonymous</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sobriety</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Rational Recovery</ENAMEX>; outpatient treatments; and
guided self-change45 may also be appropriate for a wide range of
drinking problems. In any case, the broader the net cast by the
screening instrument that identifies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with alcohol
problems, the more flexible and wide-ranging should be the referral
and post-discharge options.
The assessment and intervention could be delivered by a variety
of trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> who have some expertise in motivational
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>, understand alcohol problems, and are armed with a
series of viable options to assist the patient<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> The intervention,
by necessity, needs to be brief and limited in contact consisting
of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 to 40 minutes</TIMEX> of interaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interventions</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> who
conducts them need to be flexible and creative in adapting to
situations created by the injuries and the noisy and often chaotic
nature of emergency settings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communication</ENAMEX> rather than
confrontation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> rather than condemnation, and facilitation
rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> or law enforcement should mark the interventions.
If there is a legal aspect to the case, it should be separated from
the clinical intervention as much as possible. Multiple, feasible
referral options that vary in intensity and scope should be
available as part of the intervention. Since data from other
studies indicate that facilitating the referral and making the
connections increase compliance, the intervention ideally should
have a component of compliance enhancement if it includes referral
to community treatment programs.
Next steps
Research is needed to confirm and extend the findings to date
about interventions in emergency settings. Unresolved questions
about the nature and format of the intervention that could use
input from research are enumerated below.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Should there be several types of interventions for differing
levels of severity? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> with less severe alcohol problems
may benefit from a brief intervention with little or no follow-up
or referral<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> Are there subpopulations that benefit more from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motivational</ENAMEX> or brief interventions?46,47 Should we triage the most
severe problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> into a more intensive intervention in the
emergency setting? What are the long-term outcomes (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 months</TIMEX> or
more) of various interventions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of differing levels of
severity?
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Who can best deliver the intervention? How involved should
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s attending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> in the medical treatment be in
the intervention for alcohol problems? Most emergency department
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> do not believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> would be the
best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> to provide effective treatment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.42</NUMEX> There are a variety
of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> that could be trained to deliver the intervention
including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX>, social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> abuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX>. However, it may be more a matter of
skill and ability to work in this setting and deliver the needed
type of intervention rather than of profession that should
determine who should deliver the intervention.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Should the intervention include the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>? Are family
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> a help or hindrance in the intervention? Family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> can be of significant assistance in the intervention<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.48</NUMEX>
However, they can also interfere with the interview by suggesting
non-cooperation, interfering with the candidness of the
self-report, and trying to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> from the
intervention in some misguided attempt to help. Including family
should be done carefully and thoughtfully, if at all.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. What are the constraints regarding the timing of the
intervention? Must the intervention occur in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 hours</TIMEX> or
can it be included in discharge planning and delivered after
discharge? We need to know more about the closing of this "window
of opportunity" and whether delay interferes with motivation.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. How can emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> be trained to facilitate the
screening and intervention? Would particular approaches to training
be more effective in reaching emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>?
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. How does extent of injury or severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> affect the
intervention? It is clear that some injuries create barriers to
intervention in the emergency setting. Is a separate protocol
needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for surgery
or other medical treatments that necessitate a hospital stay?
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Should all interventions triage and intervene based on
patient readiness to change? The perspective of the stages of
change <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> appears to be an appealing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and
interventionist under-stand the process of change for addictive and
health behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.49,50</NUMEX> Incorporating this perspective into
interventions in the emergency setting has been suggested by
several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>.24,25
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Are there significant policy issues that must be resolved to
make interventions for alcohol problems more feasible? For example,
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> do not routinely obtain a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BAC</ENAMEX> test because of a
fear of denial of payment for medical care by third-party payors
for injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who test positive. This fear is well grounded.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rivara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in a survey of insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> found
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> indicated that intoxication at the time
of injury allowed for exclusion of coverage<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.51</NUMEX> A review of state
statutes, including those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>, revealed
that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have a provision that allows third-party payors to
issue policies that deny payment for injuries sustained while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intoxicated</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rivara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> note, "this option seems
to be enforced rarely by most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>," we are aware of anecdotal
reports of emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> that have
ceased testing because of the fears of non-payment. However, our
inquiry to billing department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland Shock Trauma</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>, which admits <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, revealed not a
single case of denial of payment.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. There is also a need for health services research to examine
technology transfer and explore ways to disseminate research
findings to emergency settings of differing size and complexity.
Implementation is as important as the intervention in these
settings. Unless screening and
intervention becomes an integral part of the emergency triage
and treatment system, it will be an appendage that will be
inconsistently applied or tried and discarded. An intervention
template with options incorporating the alcohol problem
intervention into the various settings should be developed and
evaluated.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. As we have indicated, guidelines and best practices have
been published that deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> dependence and abuse and
emergency medicine. The challenge now is to discover how government
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> and professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> can promote adoption and
implementation of intervention guidelines.
The opportunity
A combination of basic research, program implementation and
evaluation studies, and policy and procedure evaluations are needed
to resolve the issues outlined previously. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joseph</ENAMEX>
Zuska, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> with an interest in alcohol problems among injured
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> noted: "The crisis that brings the alcoholic to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surgeon</ENAMEX> is an opportunity for intervention in a progressive, often
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fatal disease</ENAMEX>."<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 More</NUMEX> recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Substance Abuse Task Force</ENAMEX>
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society of Academic Emergency Medicine</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>'Onofrio
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> emphasized that in the emergency department setting,
"Early intervention and appropriate referral of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems have the potential to reduce alcohol-related
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality."<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> An accumulating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of evidence
supports these calls for intervention. However, systemic and
practical barriers must be overcome and additional research
conducted to take full advantage of this opportunity.

Response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo DiClemente</ENAMEX>'s Presentation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gail D'Onofrio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>
I am honored to be a discussant following <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiClemete</ENAMEX>'s
comments about interventions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting to the
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>) with alcohol problems. We have just heard
compelling evidence regarding the efficacy of brief intervention in
a variety of settings including primary care, inpatient trauma
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>, and emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, and for multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>,
ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.
We now know several truths. First, screening and brief
intervention (SBI) does work. A recent evidence-based review of the
literature on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBI</ENAMEX>, conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Degutis</ENAMEX> and me, revealed
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> studies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> randomized controlled and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> cohort) with a positive
effect demonstrated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> of these studies.1 We also know that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visit offers a potential "teachable moment" due to the possible
negative consequences surrounding it and that in essence we, as
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, have a captive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. In addition, we know
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> are likely to need our help more
than those who present to primary care. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cherpitel</ENAMEX> recently compared
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> with those presenting to primary care
in the same metropolitan area. She found that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were one
and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-half</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times more likely than primary care patients
to report heavy drinking, consequences of drinking, alcohol
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dependence</ENAMEX>, or history of treatment for an alcohol problem<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>
It is now time for us to adapt the information we have learned
from these efficacy trials to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> setting and move on to
effectiveness trials. In doing so, we face unique challenges. These
include time pressures, competing priorities, few formal follow-up
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX>, negative attitudes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, and a multitude of
systems problems in an environment that at best can be described as
controlled chaos. Perhaps the largest hurdle is the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> have not yet bought into the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBI</ENAMEX> is part of
their role or responsibility.
To be effective, our research strategies must be brief and
clear. In real life, there is not a cadre of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to screen
and administer lengthy interventions. Therefore, protocols must be
capable of being integrated into existing systems with available
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>.
I am going to show you a clip from a video entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The</ENAMEX>
Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Physician and the Problem Drinker: Motivating Patients</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Change.3 Actual ED</ENAMEX> scenarios are used to demonstrate common
problems or traps that arise when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> attempt to counsel
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> about their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use. The intervention featured, the
brief negotiation interview, includes establishing rapport, raising
the subject of problem drinking, providing feedback, and assessing
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s readiness to change. Specific strategies to
intervene, based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s readiness to change, are
demonstrated to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> start the process of finding his
or her own solutions to change. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> versions of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>/patient
interaction are depicted: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that is likely to be unsuccessful,
and one that is likely to be successful.
To be successful in developing effectiveness trials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
setting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> must be very clear about a number of issues
when developing their proposals. These issues include:
Who should be screened?
Should we target certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>-the injured or non-injured;
the at-risk, harmful, or hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinker</ENAMEX>; or the dependent
drinker? Should we concentrate on the life cycle, from adolescence
to older age, or should we concentrate first on more defined
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>? It is unrealistic to assume that one intervention will
work for everyone.
What should the intervention include?
The message of the intervention is vital. It should be brief,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scripted</ENAMEX>, and reproducible. Exactly what constitutes brief? The
exact time of the intervention should be recorded. What is included
in the intervention should be clearly stated. Should we be sure to
include the acceptable components of brief intervention as outlined
in the acronym FRAMES: feedback, responsibility, advice, menu of
strategies, empathy, and self-efficacy?<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> Is making a connection
between drinking and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visit important? Is there a
prescription or recommendation given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>? Does the
message include advice or add a component of motivational
enhancement therapy? Does the research protocol monitor adherence
to the message, and how?
Who should provide the screening and intervention?
Which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> actually screens for problems and provides the
intervention? Different sites can be creative about who conducts
the interventions. Is it best done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, or health
promotion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX>?<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Is it possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can be screened
by completing computer programs while waiting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>, with
results then relayed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>?<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
How can we motivate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> to change?
What can be done to motivate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and other health care
providers to change their behaviors and incorporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBI</ENAMEX> into their
practices? What are the motivators? Are they patient driven so that
documentation of a decrease in recidivism and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and
mortality must be proven to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>? Or are they
tied to reimbursement? Are emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> more likely to
include counseling in their practice if it is a billable service?
What other barriers must be removed or systems changes made before
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBI</ENAMEX> is successful in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>? Available resources are essential, as
well as perceived support and role models<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX> A great deal of time is
spent developing continuous quality improvement projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> for
problems with far less prevalence. Return visits and deaths are
often tracked. Why not include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with alcohol problems in
this process?
What exactly is included in educational programs for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX>?
Standard didactic educational programs have not been shown to
change
physician behavior and subsequently improve patient care<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>
However,
evidence indicates that skills-based interactive sessions can
change practice<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9,10</NUMEX>
How do we measure success?
What outcomes are we measuring? Do they include a decrease in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumption or decreases in negative consequences, such as
drinking and driving violations or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and work problems? A
decrease in morbidity and mortality may be more difficult to
measure and require a lengthy follow-up period, but it provides
much more meaningful data to the practicing emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>. It
is also possible that tracking
referrals to primary care or specialized treatment programs may
be an important outcome. Rates of enrollment in treatment programs
and compliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointments</ENAMEX> may be meaningful outcomes.
How long one brief intervention may affect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' behavior is
unclear. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> have no formal relationships with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> beyond the index visit, and it is entirely plausible that
the effect of the brief intervention may be short lived. Therefore,
certain outcomes may need to be measured early at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or three</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. However, one may also argue that it is possible that there
may be a "sleeper effect," or delayed emergence of treatment
efficacy, as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Malley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX>,11,12 making it
imperative that assessments be continued for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> or more.
All of these questions need to be answered in future studies if
we are to prove that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBI</ENAMEX> is effective in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> setting. It is
crucial that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are clear on all aspects of their research
protocols so that future projects can either replicate or build on
past experiences. These aspects include exclusion and inclusion
criteria, the specifics of the intervention (i.e., what, how, and
by whom), and the specific outcomes to be measured. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adherence</ENAMEX> to
the protocol should also be assured.
In conclusion, there is no "silver bullet," or one exact
intervention that will work for everybody. We must focus on small,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incremental</ENAMEX> steps and realize that the entire process will be a
long one. Fortunately, the number of ideas and research questions
are endless, allowing for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple</ENAMEX> studies and a great deal of
creativity on the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>.

Intervening with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcohol Problems</ENAMEX> in
Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX>:
Discussion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DiClementi and Soderstrom Article</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristen Lawton Barry</ENAMEX>, PhD
Reducing death and disability related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> remains a
national health status goal<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1,2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cherpitel</ENAMEX> and others have suggested
that the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>) may be the ideal place to
identify alcohol problems and to begin interventions, particularly
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> with an injury<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>-10 Several
compelling reasons make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> an important setting for alcohol
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. First, a large number and variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
do not have their hazardous drinking detected or treated in other
primary or tertiary care settings. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems are released from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> rather than being
admitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> where detection may be more likely. Finally,
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>, there can be an immediacy between the
event bringing them to this setting (e.g., injuries) and possible
identification of and intervention for an alcohol problem.
Logistical challenges to brief interventions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> presents unique challenges, however, for identifying and
intervening with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who drink at a hazardous level. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> is
a fast-paced environment with many competing demands that do not
allow for concentrated periods of personnel time devoted to
intervening with long-term problems, even if the problems are
related to a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visit. It is of great importance to
develop intervention strategies that can be used easily and
efficiently in this setting.
Medical care challenges in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
In addition to the practical problems generally associated with
screening and intervention in this venue, pressing problems in the
delivery of medical care will affect how we intervene in the future
with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at risk for and currently experiencing problem
drinking. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2020</TIMEX>, there will be a serious shortage of nursing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> available to work in this and other medical settings<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>
This shortage will come at a time when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baby Boom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> is reaching retirement age and having more
health-related problems that lead to greater use of urgent care and
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> are already seeing greater
numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> are closing. This
critical health care shortage could exacerbate a vicious cycle of
need for care and difficulty providing that care.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soderstrom</ENAMEX> have produced a well-crafted,
state-of-the-art article and presentation about the need for,
importance of, and challenges in conducting research on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> and ultimate effectiveness of brief alcohol interventions
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who are at-risk drinkers, problem drinkers,
or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol-dependent drinkers</ENAMEX>. It is clear from their manuscript
that a spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems presents in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> and that a
spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> is necessary to meet the challenges of
providing "best practices" care.
Issues raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> and Soderstrom
This response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soderstrom's</ENAMEX> conference
presentation briefly addresses issues raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiClementi</ENAMEX>,
primarily the need for considering the use of technology to augment
or deliver brief alcohol interventions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. Previous research
has shown that brief interventions for hazardous drinking are
effective in reducing drinking levels across of variety of health
care settings, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ED.12-17</ENAMEX> However, the sample sizes,
attrition rates, types of interventions, levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">outcomes</ENAMEX> measured, and effect sizes have varied greatly across the
studies. In addition, the target of the intervention (at-risk
drinkers, problem drinkers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol-dependent drinkers</ENAMEX>) and the
mechanism of intervention (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, social
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, technology with or without provider advice) remain open
questions.
Brief alcohol interventions have generally included feedback by
a health care professional based on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' responses (screening
positive) to questions about alcohol consumption or consequences.
These results indicate that while this approach is effective for a
percentage of hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinkers</ENAMEX>, it is not effective for everyone
(effect sizes of ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30% to 40%</NUMEX>). The intervention studies based on
provider feedback and advice to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> have had mixed results
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. In addition, it remains difficult to engage health care
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> in conducting brief interventions in this venue
because of the volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the urgency of other
presenting problems. It is becoming clear that, to be widely
effective, an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ED</ENAMEX>-based brief alcohol intervention model that
requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> to give advice and written materials to the
screen-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will need some modification.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> concepts that appear often in the literature may be useful
in informing future research. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> potentially provides an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> "teachable moment" for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have problems with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use. It is thought that this is particularly true if the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s use can be tied to the reason for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visit. However,
it may also be anticipated that using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visit as a teachable
moment may be effective for non-injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who drink at risk
excessively. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> is a fast-paced environment in which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> cannot easily find time to conduct brief alcohol
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>, even if they have the training, skills, and desire
to do so. The concept of the teachable moment, although only a
conceptualization at this time, provides part of the seminal
interest in doing alcohol interventions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. On the other
hand, the fast pace of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> may play a role in why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> find
it difficult to address alcohol issues at all, particularly for
those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who do not present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> with problems or
conditions clearly linked to alcohol consumption.
The implementation of brief alcohol intervention systems in
"real world" emergency medical practice has not been easy. This has
been true in primary care settings as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Efficacy</ENAMEX> trials are the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, but implementation of proven alcohol screening and
brief intervention systems in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>- and community-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settings</ENAMEX> has been the most difficult part of the process. Serious
logistical challenges remain in developing systems that facilitate
the use of these techniques on a regular basis.
The combination of the potential opportunity to affect the
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumption of at-risk drinkers and the limited time for
providers to intervene, along with the higher volume and projected
shortages of nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, necessitates the need to expand
research on brief alcohol interventions specifically with the use
of new technology. The use of technology may reduce the time needed
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to personally provide screening and
intervention services and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target patients</ENAMEX> who can derive benefit
from the brief intervention messages.
In addition, because of the effect sizes shown by the studies to
date, there is also a need to target responses and elements of the
brief intervention to the problems specific to each individual
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who scores
positive for at-risk drinking or more serious alcohol-related
problems. The use of new technologies for individualizing brief
intervention materials and feedback may help to fill gaps in the
system of care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with at-risk and problem drinking
patterns.
This is a large challenge and a large expectation for any one
system of intervention. Just as there is a spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use
problems, there may be a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX>. These solutions will
need to address both the types of interventions that best fit each
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> and medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and the specific problems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
"One size fits all" does not work in brief interventions, just as
it does not work in clinical practice in general. Taking a public
health perspective, methods are sought that are the most effective
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clinically</ENAMEX> and financially.
New directions in brief alcohol interventions in emergency
medicine
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the innovations being tested at this time is the use of
automated computerized screening with real-time production of brief
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">workbook</ENAMEX> content tailored to specific problems. The use of
computerized, tailored messaging represents an important technique
to provide targeted, individualized feedback to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> considered
most open to change messages. Tailored messaging systems have been
found effective in the areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, smoking cessation,
dietary intake, and use of mammography<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX>
Other technologies that may be useful in the future include the
use of interactive voice recognition (IVR) technology to facilitate
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX>, delivery of educational interventions, and follow-up of
patient progress by telephone. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IVR</ENAMEX> telephone availability <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> could facilitate follow-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Interactive
computer programs on laptops or palm computers, web-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>, computerized bundling of brief health messages for
multiple health risks (e.g., smoking, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use, seat belt use),
and audio interventions tailored to specific problems and delivered
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">headsets19</TIMEX> are also being posited as potential approaches
in emergency and urgent care settings.
Some of these technologies have been raised because of system
barriers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>-based interventions. The use of technology
(e.g., hand-held computerized screening, interactive headphone
delivery of messages, tailored messaging booklets) to assist in
interventions in a
crowded, busy venue may allow a level of privacy that addresses
the shame and stigma many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> feel about problems related
to alcohol misuse and abuse.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> in the emergency setting range from those with no
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems to those with severe dependence. In the next few
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, a variety of exciting intervention techniques will be tested
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> and urgent care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drs. DiClemente</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soderstrom</ENAMEX> have
set the stage for us to think about what is needed in the future to
provide best practices care to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with problems related to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use. Any methods that are developed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> working together will help to overcome barriers and
promote best practices care for a range of drinkers in the
emergency setting.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Discussion</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Longabaugh</ENAMEX> commented on how much remains unknown about
what motivates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to change their use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. He noted
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX> previously had found that readiness to
change was predicted by whether or not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> attributed their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
injury visit to their drinking. They expected the same result in
their new study with hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinkers</ENAMEX> who had a positive BAC at
the time of their injury visit. However, they were surprised to
find that regardless of whether the injury was attributed to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> or not, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> did equally well at follow-up.
Consequently, the motivational mechanism is not clear. Another
surprise was that in the new study, a single intervention session
at the time of the emergency visit made no difference in any
outcome measures at either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who
returned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 to 10 days later</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX> intervention session did
not improve on outcomes at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX>, but they did improve on
alcohol-related negative consequences and injuries at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two-thirds</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> returned for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> session, but that
proportion varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> across the different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventionists</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristen Barry</ENAMEX> noted that in primary care studies, one session
seems to be enough to foster change. However, she found it
interesting that booster sessions worked in this setting. Even
though the intervention did not decrease drinking, it did decrease
drinking-related consequences, which may be part of what we're
looking for in this setting.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo DiClemente</ENAMEX> said the message needs to be reinforced after
discharge. In his work, they are using a feedback letter and phone
calls at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>. He noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longabaugh</ENAMEX>'s data
indicate there is benefit from a post-discharge contact and that we
will see if other studies confirm that.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Diesenhaus</ENAMEX> added that there must be some type of
maintenance activity if we are dealing with a chronic, relapsing
condition. The research questions are how to determine which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> need maintenance activities, what types of activities they
need, and when or how often they are needed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Dunn</ENAMEX> related that his research interventions took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX>, but his interventions outside the research arena
took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 20 minutes</TIMEX> because the process did not have to be so
complicated and uniform, and there was less data collection. He
observed that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> question of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMAST</ENAMEX> ("Do you think you're
a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinker</ENAMEX>?") forced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to label and marginalize
themselves. This had created many difficulties during his
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. He noted that he prefers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUDIT</ENAMEX>. An original goal
of the study was to encourage post-discharge alcohol treatment, but
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5% to 10%</NUMEX> of study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> went to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> treatment or
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcoholics Anonymous</ENAMEX> session. Consequently, he questioned how
important that goal should be. Very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> refused to speak
to him or had problems with privacy during the interview. Family
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were present <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> of the time, and their impact on
the intervention varied. He noted that even though interventions
are evidence-based, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> in
non-research settings will make an intervention their own. In any
case, he observed, even in the existing randomized trials of
interventions that use motivational interviewing, we cannot
evaluate the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX>' skill levels. In future trials,
he recommended that the fidelity of the intervention and variations
among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> be more closely monitored.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> agreed that we have not monitored closely enough what
intervention is being delivered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> we train.
The good news is that across many trials, the interventions being
delivered seem to work. She also agreed that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> question of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMAST</ENAMEX> is problematic. She noted that the short and long MAST
for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">geriatric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have been modified, eliminating the
problems.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Monti</ENAMEX> agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunn</ENAMEX> that measuring treatment fidelity
is extremely important. He cited a brief report and an upcoming
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter</ENAMEX> in a book about interventions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> that
describes how studies at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX> evaluate fidelity. He also noted
that none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clinical trials (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentillelo's</ENAMEX> with trauma
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, his own with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longabaugh's</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>)
used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> staff to conduct interventions. He
recommended that future research evaluate whether using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> is more cost effective than using specially hired
staff. He wondered if using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> could increase treatment
efficacy enough to offset the added cost of training and possible
decreased delivery of interventions. He also noted that given
the costs and difficulties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> setting, the relative
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> and cost of booster sessions is another important issue
deserving further research. In his continuing trial, he should be
able to address this question because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> will be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to booster sessions or a single session. Although his
study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> found reductions in risky behavior and
alcohol-related harm, he was disappointed to find no effect on
drinking. Given the harmful levels of drinking among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> in
his studies, he remarked that it is irresponsible for interventions
not to focus on drinking as well as harm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gail D'Onofrio</ENAMEX> noted that her planned study will use <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician assistants</ENAMEX>, and senior emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> to
deliver brief interventions for injured and non-injured harmful and
hazardous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinkers</ENAMEX>. The study will allocate resources to promote
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> to the treatment protocol and monitor treatment fidelity.
It also will control for ancillary treatments that might influence
intervention outcome.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Bernstein</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project Assert</ENAMEX> adapted a
readiness-to-change instrument for use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were
asked to place themselves on a readiness scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 10</NUMEX>. If
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> rated themselves on the low end of the scale, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
then asked them what would bring them to a higher score.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiClemente</ENAMEX> commented that such adjustments to instruments are
often necessary. In assessing change, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> can use
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> markers to help them: importance, confidence, and
readiness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> praised the use of a linear method to measure stages of
change. She added that an in-home, brief intervention linked with
primary care found no association between stage of change and
outcome. She thought more research is needed on this issue.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Hungerford</ENAMEX> noted that there are operational realities in
the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> that must be considered in order to
implement interventions. At the same time, some central questions
need to be submitted to empirical testing. The screening and brief
intervention trial he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> did
not include a booster session and had a mode intervention time of
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 minutes</TIMEX>. Although outcomes for the experimental and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were not significantly different at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX>,
outcomes improved for both groups
compared to baseline. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">At 12 months</TIMEX>, outcomes for both groups
were still not different, but the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had
improved had decreased and was no longer significantly different
from baseline. He concluded that a brief intervention might have a
short-lived effect that degrades over time. Consequently, a booster
intervention might be helpful. His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> point was that there is
an easy assumption that a brief intervention is more appropriate
for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with mild-to-moderate problems than for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
severe problems. It is thought they are more likely to respond
successfully. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> project is on a college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX>.
Many of the college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> have mild alcohol
problems and are confident they could overcome their alcohol
problems if they wanted to. However, most of them do not feel this
issue is important enough to address. At follow-up, it is the
non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with more severe problems who are more
likely to improve. He concluded we should not trust easy
assumptions, but instead treat them as empirical questions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barry</ENAMEX> reinforced the importance of looking at this issue by age
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, noting that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult males</ENAMEX> were least affected by
interventions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> early intervention study. She
concurred with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungerford</ENAMEX>'s observation that intervention effects
seem to wear off after a period of time. She suggested that
although booster interventions are needed, perhaps they are not
needed very often, particularly in primary care settings.
Maintenance of effect might be possible with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX>
consultations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> noted that some trials have found <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with more
severe problems being helped; others have helped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with more
moderate problems. Readiness to change may or may not be related to
problem severity. Similarly, readiness to cut down may not coincide
with readiness to abstain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who are more ready to cut down
are generally less ready to abstain. There is strong evidence that
readiness to change and confidence, especially before treatment,
are unrelated. Sophisticated research is required to tease apart
the complex interactions between these variables.
D'Onofrio agreed that methodological issues are extremely
important. She noted that research studies often attempt to control
so many variables and follow up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> so frequently that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> receive so much attention focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> that it
may constitute an
intervention, particularly when compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
receive standard care. Even if the assessment is embedded in a
general health-needs survey, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> know they are being asked
about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and that could affect their answers. These
methodological problems can mask valid intervention effects.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monti</ENAMEX> believed that a decision to screen only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
severe alcohol problems is premature. In his study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>,
he saw a decrease in drinking among all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. However, the only
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who showed a differential effect from the brief
intervention were precontemplators in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13- to 17-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
For younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, he concluded, the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> visit was a
powerful event.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Woolard</ENAMEX> related that many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> they approached to
participate in research still had measurable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> levels.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> required a mental status exam to ensure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could
understand the research dimensions of the project before they could
be enrolled in the study. Therefore, the study was able to
correlate mental status exam scores with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> levels at the time
of consent. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX> had impaired
mental status, mostly in short-term memory. He wondered at what
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could remember an intervention. If
they had had to wait until <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were sober, many would be
discharged because in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are discharged when staff
estimate their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> is below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> reported that most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who got the longer
intervention in his study remembered the interventionist at the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> follow-up, so there was some recall.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Brown</ENAMEX> commented on high up-front costs required to
develop technological means of delivering these services, such as
computer-based screening. He said funding mechanisms such as small
business grants were not always appropriate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and
wondered whether there were other funding mechanisms that might be
more appropriate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> replied that her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had used the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX> grant programs to
help develop or adapt technology, but she admitted that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX> grants
can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> replied that only a certain proportion of the funding can
be applied toward development in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX> grants, and some of the
technology, for example interactive videos, can be quite expensive
to develop.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elinor Walker</ENAMEX> reminded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency for Healthcare</ENAMEX>
Research and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quality</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">03</NUMEX> program with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> cap,
including both direct and indirect costs. She noted that these
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> are reviewed by a study section, but one that may be more
forgiving than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. However, the program is still
quite competitive, and the project would probably have to involve
testing as well as development.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longabaugh</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> grants, which are available for
development of treatments, could be used to develop
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Dufour</ENAMEX> observed that there are few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> who are
skilled at both the research and the business aspects of a project,
so small business grants seldom go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the scientific
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> want to go that route, she recommended
they get help from someone well-versed in business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Sommers</ENAMEX> related her experience from two clinical trials
among hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. In both, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> clinicians, all female,
implemented the study. Because the trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is mostly
young, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>, and not always easy to work with, the gender of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interventionist</ENAMEX> could be important. Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, especially
male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, have more authority in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which may
affect whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> take advice. She observed that the gender
of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> has not been well documented
in studies. This can make it difficult to standardize
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. She hypothesized that under-standing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
perception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interventionist</ENAMEX>'s capabilities might be as
important as having detailed measurements of intervention fidelity
across <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX>. She noted that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> feel
rushed to move these interventions into clinical settings because
they know we need to be addressing alcohol problems. She asked the
panel how to balance this need with the many important scientific
questions that still need to be answered.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DiClemente</ENAMEX> observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project MATCH</ENAMEX> had examined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
between gender and treatment outcome and found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> did
better in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-step programs. However, to examine the effect of
matching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> would require randomizing
large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX>. He
agreed that the authority issue is important, but he suggested
smaller, targeted research studies could address that question. He
cautioned that not every study has to be a clinical trial focused
on outcomes. To examine the issue of gender, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> could be
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> and both could be asked to evaluate
their perceptions of the interaction. He noted that the balance
between research and clinical practice is always a challenge. He
posed the following questions: Do we wait until we know exactly how
the intervention works before we move interventions into practice?
Or, do we start in a practice setting and keep refining as we go
along? His sense was that the field would benefit from starting in
the practice setting to learn how interventions work in real-world
clinical settings. As research evidence accumulates, it can inform
best practices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intervention trials among older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in
primary care. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interventions</ENAMEX> performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trial
had results as good as interventions performed by social workers
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> in the other. Although she thought age of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interventionist</ENAMEX> could be an influential factor, she was unsure
because there are so many interactions and factors that we have not
looked at very carefully.
D'Onofrio, in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sommer</ENAMEX>'s concerns, suggested that a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> might be more receptive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> because
they are less authoritative and more nurturing, and they listen
better. So the reverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> could be just as valid.
Sommers suggested that some of these questions could be
addressed by pooling data sets from existing clinical trials and
hoped this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conference</ENAMEX> would be a step in that direction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longabaugh</ENAMEX> noted one matching effect that persisted throughout
the post-treatment period in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Project MATCH</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Clients</ENAMEX> with high trait
anger, who were therefore likely to resist directive interventions,
were more successful with a motivational enhancement intervention.
Other clients
were more successful with directive treatment interventions such
as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-step approach or cognitive behavioral therapy. He remarked
that it would be possible to evaluate this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> by matching
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' likelihood to accept directive interventions to either
brief, directive physician-implemented interventions or
specialist-based motivational interventions. He added that the
literature shows client outcomes and cost-benefits are improved by
either research follow-up or a brief monitoring phone call.
Finally, he suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s level of distress could
influence motivational level as much as the severity of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lowe</ENAMEX> speculated that the current situation represents
both a unique opportunity for an intervention in the emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and a failure of the primary care system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> seems
like an appropriate venue for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol interventions</ENAMEX> because many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have alcohol problems and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visit may represent a
teachable moment. However, primary care is responsible for the
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> contact as well as comprehensive, continuous care. If many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have no primary care or primary care providers do not
screen for alcohol-related problems, then primary care has failed.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> is essentially making up for the failures of primary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, perhaps focusing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> for interventions is not the most
strategic approach. He then asked how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> should use their limited
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Should they be screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with the worst
problems? Or, are these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the least likely to respond to
interventions available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>? If milder cases are more likely
to respond, perhaps they should be a higher priority.
D'Onofrio noted that many young, healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> do not go to
their primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>, even if they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Even with
managed care efforts to decrease expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visits, the number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> has increased, so primary care and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> have to work
together. Since brief intervention does not work with severely
dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ED</ENAMEX>-based interventions should refer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to
treatment. She added that when she has not been able to reach
everyone, she responds to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who request help. However,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have not considered asking for help may make progress
toward getting help because of a connection made by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
intervention.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> agreed that difficult cases do take most of the time and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> currently spent on alcohol problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. She noted
that we have to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have severe alcohol problems.
However, she believed that it is also important to use resources to
reach as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as possible and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> currently exist
that, once refined, can be fairly easy to implement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> pointed out that in an ideal world, primary care
would provide consistent contact, and interventions could happen
over time. However, until that happens, other systems will have to
pick up what falls through the cracks. Providing resources in the
emergency setting has implications for the primary care setting. We
need to be figuring out how to connect primary care and emergency
care settings rather than splitting them apart.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Smith</ENAMEX> described difficulties he had had with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> in a
study on drinking and boating injuries. He suggested that the final
report from the conference include a section that addresses the
difficult human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> issues involved in working with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intoxicated patients</ENAMEX>, such as protocols and procedures that IRBs
found unacceptable.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> noted that because of human subjects violations and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> human subjects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> have handled their paperwork, whole
programs have been shut down. As a result, human subjects
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> have been under intense scrutiny. She pointed out that
even ongoing programs have been re-scrutinized and required to make
protocol changes. However, standards seem to vary across
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> noted that this variation is the problem and why he wants
these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> to be addressed by the conference in written
form.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bombardier</ENAMEX> noted that the rate of spontaneous remission
could minimize the differences between experimental and control
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. This problem makes it difficult to determine the
appropriate time to schedule outcome assessments and booster
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. He suggested a number of factors that might
influence spontaneous remission such as an injury, type and
severity of injury, degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> dependence, readiness to
change, and marital or employment status. He thought natural
history
studies or pooling of control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> data might better identify
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predictors</ENAMEX>. More data on this issue could help us plan better
controlled trials-who to target, when to follow up, and when to
give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boosters</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Maio</ENAMEX> reported that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> shared their
protocols with him and this helped his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRB</ENAMEX> clearance process go
more smoothly. He noted that most brief intervention studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX>
have focused on injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, but that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70% to 80%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> do not present with an injury. He wondered how much of
what we learn from the injury <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can be applied to patients
who are not injured.
D'Onofrio replied that her study was looking at both injured and
non-injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. She noted that primary care studies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ed</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> project do give us experience with non-injured
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> added that his study was also for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and
most primary care studies involve non-injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. He thought
their findings help support work with non-injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> setting as well.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Perry</ENAMEX> reported that one alcohol intervention project in
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York State</ENAMEX> was implemented in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, but in a different
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> in each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. She observed that after interventions have been
shown to be effective, they will have to be adapted to new
settings. She suggested we must identify the essential elements of
interventions that are required in any new setting. Another lesson
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> project was that each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> must have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX>.
She observed that it would be useful to know in advance how to
identify whom that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> might be. She added that physician
buy-in is critical to overcoming professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, and that
it is important to identify additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> who can move
intervention services forward in a particular setting or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>.
D'Onofrio remarked that when it comes to brief interventions,
many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are pre-contemplators. She suggested that changing
physician behavior can incorporate the same concepts that are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> behavior.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Shope</ENAMEX> expressed her belief that addressing alcohol problems
in the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> is the failure not just of primary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, but of many systems. Her work has been in substance abuse
prevention in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, where she encountered many social and legal
beliefs that ran counter to her prevention education efforts. She
believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> setting is just one of many where alcohol
problems should be addressed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Babor</ENAMEX> wondered whether a couple of unquestioned
assumptions had arisen during discussions at the conference. The
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was that because time and resources are limited in the
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, interventions should be simplified and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> in scope. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> was that we may have difficulty
selling alcohol interventions because they are in competition with
other types of interventions such as helmet use, seat belt use, or
smoking prevention. He suggested that making interventions more
ambitious and partnering with other programs that also are looking
at behavioral risk factors might get us a more prominent place on
the agenda. He suggested that the scientific question is whether we
can intervene effectively and simultaneously for the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> risk factors that often overlap in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. If the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> showed we could, the policy question would be whether we
could get a bigger place on the agenda if we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> with other
programs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> recalled that we used to think a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> could not
quit smoking and drinking at the same time. Recent data have shown
that not to be true. He also observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who screen
positive for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> risk factor often have multiple risk factors. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> could decide how many risk factors could be addressed at
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time. A problem arises when the factors the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> wants to
work on are not the same ones the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> thinks are most
important or is most prepared to deal with. There are few "pure"
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alcoholics</ENAMEX> anymore. Most use other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> as well, so it is
important to be able to intervene for a variety of problems. This
is a real challenge for policy, institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. We will have to change our thinking and consider the
many conditions for which we could intervene.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> surmised that grant proposals to look at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
health behavior at a time had already been submitted, but she did
not know if they had been funded.
In response, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunn</ENAMEX> described a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-minute ED</TIMEX>-based intervention
funded to change <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> behaviors among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>: not wearing bike
helmets, failing to use seat belts, carrying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX>, binge
drinking, riding with a drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>, and drinking and driving.
However, the protocol did not ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> which behaviors they
were motivated to change. The intervention led to a small change in
bike helmet use and a slightly larger change in seat belt use, but
it did not lead to changes in alcohol variables or weapon
carrying.
D'Onofrio observed that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project Assert</ENAMEX> and her project
funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</ENAMEX> provided intervention
for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple behaviors</ENAMEX>, and that brief interventions for all
behaviors were based on the same principles. She reasoned that
there were so many risk factors that should be addressed that some
sort of bundling would be necessary. She said that the prevalence
of alcohol problems was higher than other risk factors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX>
frequently ask about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tetanus</ENAMEX> immunizations even though almost none
have ever seen a case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tetanus</ENAMEX>. They readily ask about seat belts
and distribute handouts about various behaviors. She believed that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> is not the issue as much as redirecting the focus of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> during their time with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> suggested that funding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> may have to become partners
before support for the bundling of interventions could become a
reality.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lewis</ENAMEX> commented that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX>, patients
have been bringing a great deal of information to medical
encounters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> actually bring printouts of questions to ask
their primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>. Due to the amount of information now
available, power has shifted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. He
would like to see more thinking about how these changes should be
incorporated into research and more strategies that piggy-back on
this information revolution and shift in power.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guohua Li</ENAMEX> disagreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> that the efficacy of brief
intervention in emergency settings had been established. He
believed studies from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> should be viewed very
critically because access to health care is easier than in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. He believed that
studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> emergency settings have provided
inconclusive evidence that brief intervention works. He cautioned
that literature reviews generally do not include all relevant
studies because studies with negative results are seldom
published.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DiClemente</ENAMEX> agreed that efficacy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> setting had not been
totally established. He noted that many practices that do not have
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> or effectiveness studies behind them are adopted and
become guidelines for standard practice. Once that happens, it is
very difficult to get support to re-evaluate them, so it is true we
must be careful when evaluating social science and psycho-social
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. However, we are so sophisticated psychometrically
and methodologically that virtually every piece of research can be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissected</ENAMEX>, revealing flaws and problems. If we continue to do that,
we will never make any changes in services. He recommended a
balance between the rigor of research and the application process
that needs to happen.
