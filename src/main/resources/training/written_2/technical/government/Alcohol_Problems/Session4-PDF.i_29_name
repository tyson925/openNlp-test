<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Implementing Preventive Interventions</ENAMEX> in
Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Considerations</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry M. Gentilello</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> who may benefit from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> counseling are often
unaware of their need for treatment. The provision of alcohol
interventions in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>) may provide an
opportunity to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are currently not actively
seeking such care. Due to their lack of awareness of their problem,
these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are unlikely to present for treatment on their
own.
Treatment does not need to be sought actively to be effective<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>
How-ever, motivation can facilitate treatment. Studies suggest that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> can opportunistically capitalize on the motivating
effects of acute injuries or medical conditions that require
emergency care to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of the need for behavior
change<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> This process may identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have not yet
developed severe dependence, thereby pre-venting the development of
more intractable stages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>. Finally, such interventions
may have the potential to decrease repeated use of emergency
department resources<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Randomized</ENAMEX> trials of inexpensive screening and intervention
protocols that are feasible for use in the brief contact setting of
the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> have been shown empirically to be
effective when used in a variety of settings outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>-6 A
recent analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> randomized trials, each of which was limited
to one session and consisted of less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> of motivational
counseling, demonstrated that heavy drinkers were twice as likely
to moderate their drinking when compared with those who did not
receive an intervention<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX>
Brief interventions were specifically designed to target
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are drinking at hazardous levels but have not become
dependent. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treated in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> need more
intensive treatment such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inpatient</ENAMEX> or outpatient therapy or
participation in self-help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Brief interventions may be used
to motivate such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to seek or accept a referral to more
intensive treatment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>
As proven alcohol interventions emerge, a systematic effort is
needed to incorporate them into emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>. The
public policy objectives of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Healthy People</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX> include routine
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> screening<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>
The provision of such interventions is currently not routine. A
variety of changes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, system, and policy level will
be needed to accomplish this goal. This paper describes the factors
that have limited the provision of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> intervention and
counseling in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and provides an agenda to
foster their implementation.
Knowledge and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> of emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> staff
Physician advocacy plays an important role in influencing
screening practices by increasing awareness of the problem and by
generating support for screening and intervention services. A
survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeons</ENAMEX> working in an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> found that
the most significant predictor of screening was the attending
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' perception that their responsibilities included
screening<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">81%</NUMEX> did not routinely screen, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> did not
believe that screening was the responsibility of emergency
department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Routine screening and intervention will require
engendering a sense of role responsibility among emergency
department clinicians towards addressing substance abuse.
This shift will require correcting misconceptions about the
validity and generalizability of treatment research results and
their relevance to the emergency department population<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11,12</NUMEX> The
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">literature</ENAMEX> suggests that these misconceptions are the result of a
relative lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> education and training in substance
abuse<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10,13</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
In the survey mentioned previously, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> indicated
that they had no prior training in screening or detection of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 75%</NUMEX> were not familiar with any of
the commonly used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">questionnaires</ENAMEX>, such as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAGE</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MAST.19,20</NUMEX> Another survey found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 25%</NUMEX> of
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> residency programs teach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> about the
quantity/ frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use questions needed to establish an
early diagnosis of an alcohol-related disorder<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX> A more recent
survey of program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> found that the average emergency
medicine residency program devotes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only three curricular hours</TIMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> abuse training<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX>
The lack of education about screening is illustrated by the fact
that the most commonly cited reason for failure to screen is lack
of time<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>
However, an effective battery of screening tools that require
minimal time and disruption to implement is already available. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">screening blood alcohol</ENAMEX> level can be obtained easily when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> is
drawn for other purposes. A simple questionnaire such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAGE</ENAMEX>
can easily be incorporated into a routine history and physical
examination. Detecting hazardous drinking in the absence of
dependence can be accomplished by asking several questions about
quantity and frequency of use (e.g., using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
questions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUDIT</ENAMEX>), which are easily memorized<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23,24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lack</ENAMEX> of
knowledge, rather than lack of time, is a more likely explanation
for failure to screen.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> do not screen because they believe that asking
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> use is intrusive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> who do not
screen are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times more likely to have this belief than
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who routinely screen<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Studies</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> do
not share this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. Trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> screening in primary
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, general medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>, trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, and emergency
departments demonstrate a high rate of patient acceptance<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>-4
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are willing to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use, but they
believe that clinical judgment is reliable and formal screening is
unnecessary<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.25</NUMEX> However, numerous studies document that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
generally fail to diagnose alcohol problems unless a formal
screening protocol is used. In one study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> screened
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,002</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for alcohol problems, but the results were not
provided to staff. The clinical detection rate for screen-positive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> ranged <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 25% and 50%</NUMEX>, depending on the type of
service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>.15
Similar results were found in a study of injured patients
treated in the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was asked to
subjectively deter-mine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were intoxicated (BAC > <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/dl</ENAMEX>) or had a chronic alcohol problem. Although <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of patients
were intoxicated, sensitivity was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 77%</NUMEX>, and sensitivity
decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were severely injured,
endotracheally intubated, or brain injured<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specificity</ENAMEX> was also
poor. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">More than 20%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were thought to be intoxicated
had no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> in their blood. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patient</ENAMEX>'s age, income, and insurance
status significantly influenced both sensitivity and specificity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were also screened with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAGE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMAST</ENAMEX>. Staff
identified <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">fewer than 50%</NUMEX> of screen-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Formal
screening protocols are needed because clinical judgment is
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unreliable</ENAMEX> and subject to bias<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15,27</NUMEX>
A key reason that screening is not performed is the widely held
perception that treatment is not effective. In the trauma center
survey mentioned previously, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 27%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> believed that
"brief interventions are at least moderately effective."<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 Nearly</TIMEX>
half believed that "there are not enough treatment resources to
make screening worthwhile." An assessment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> testing
practices found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who do not measure blood
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> concentration believe the test is "not clinically
important" because knowledge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> level
does not benefit the patient<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.28</NUMEX>
Skepticism about treatment benefits is apparently widespread.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> randomly selected emergency department
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 55%</NUMEX> believed that mental health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrists</ENAMEX>) can effectively
address alcohol problems.29 Their perception of treatment efficacy
provided by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and surgeons) was even lower,
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>. This confirms the lack of knowledge regarding the progress in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> treatment that has led to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> consensus recommendations
that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at risk for alcohol problems should be screened
and counseled or referred for counseling<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30,31</NUMEX>
Changing belief systems, clinical practices, and cognitive
barriers is a slow process and a formidable challenge.
Implementation will require increasing emergency department
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' knowledge in order to increase confidence in screening
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and to dispel myths about the futility of treatment.
However, information alone may not change clinical practice. For
example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 21%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> of myocardial infarction are treated
with beta-blockers by their primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, despite the
fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> consensus panels consider this omission a serious
medical error<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.32</NUMEX>
Studies of educational strategies to change physician behavior
suggest that informational material and formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CME</ENAMEX> conferences have
little impact, while outreach activities by professional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> conducting on-site educational
programs produce positive change<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX> However, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> become
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> because they reflect the needs and
attitudes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and therefore they are not likely to
radically change the culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The majority of
opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in emergency medicine reflect the current belief
that alcohol problems are outside their practice
domain. Unless emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with an interest in
integrating alcohol treatment services into emergency care assume
greater prominence and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, effecting change
within this specialty will be slow and uneven.
Implementation will, therefore, require the emergence of leaders
who endorse the concept that alcohol screening and intervention is
their responsibility. Funding for alcohol-related research needs to
be provided to emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> on a priority basis
because such funding will lead to their professional development,
increase their national stature, lead to their advancement in
professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, lead to association with policymakers, and
enhance their opportunity to become opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. The
development of credible opinion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who are emergency medicine
clinicians, who will endorse and advance the concept of alcohol
screening and intervention, is the best means of fostering
attitudinal change within that specialty. Changes in a specialty
practice are more likely to occur if they are supported by research
conducted within that same discipline. Advances in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specialty do
not necessarily affect the practice of another. Articles published
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> devoted to psychiatry or substance abuse will have
little impact on the practice of emergency medicine. Traditionally,
little interaction has occurred between emergency medicine
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> and substance abuse treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>. Each specialty
operates within its own domain, with little integration of services
across specialities, and they do not publish in common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>.
This tendency for medical specialties to operate within their own
discipline with little cross-dissemination of information suggests
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> must be involved in conducting intervention trials in
order to popularize the concept within their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEDLINE</ENAMEX> search of papers published using the MESH terms
"<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> AND treatment AND intervention" yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> publications
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the calendar year 2000</TIMEX>. None of these were published in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> devoted to emergency medicine. None of the trials of
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol interventions</ENAMEX> in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> were published in
journals likely to be encountered by emergency care providers<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2,34</NUMEX>
It is, therefore, not surprising that emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and
staff lack knowledge about substance abuse and have failed to
embrace research advances in screening and intervention.
Current funding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are not structured to foster the
development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in emergency medicine who endorse the
concept that addressing alcohol problems is their responsibility.
Obtaining funds from study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> on emergency care is difficult
because peer-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> do not view alcohol-related research as
being vital. There are equally formidable obstacles when attempting
to obtain funding from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reviewers</ENAMEX> may not be
familiar with the characteristics of an emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> as a
unique clinical community. They also prefer the use of highly
controlled diagnostic and demographic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in order to obtain
unambiguous answers to isolate the active ingredient of treatment
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX>. While this approach has led to great strides in
under-standing how treatment works, it may not be practical in the
real-world setting of the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and may generate
studies with little external validity.
We, therefore, have a dilemma. Grant applications submitted by
emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> that do not use the methodologic
processes preferred by alcohol research study sections are usually
going to lose when competing against grants submitted by recognized
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, studies conducted
by alcohol research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> may not provide clinically relevant
intervention protocols, are not likely to be noticed or considered
credible by emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, and will have little
impact on practice. There is little point in funding research on
interventions that are unlikely to be implemented.
The design and peer-review of studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> interventions
in the emergency care setting should be geared more towards
embracing the perspectives of emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>. Such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are in the best position to understand what research
questions are important and what type of interventions are feasible
and generalizable. While their grant applications may not have the
methodologic design that study sections composed of alcohol
research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> are accustomed to, funding such research will
lead to the development of research methodologies appropriate to
the emergency department setting.
Research conducted by emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> will help
establish a sense of role responsibility within the field, and this
attitude will be disseminated within the specialty by the work
product that is published and presented at practice-specific
professional meetings. This
will foster the development of a culture of acceptance of role
responsibility to screen and intervene, and develop lobbying
pressure to do so within the field of emergency medicine.
Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> are frequently the only point of contact
with the health care system for indigent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.35 Emergency
department interventions are consistent with the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No Wrong Door to</ENAMEX>
Treatment" theme of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Treatment Plan.36 Alcohol</ENAMEX> problems
among emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> consume an extraordinary amount
of health care dollars. Studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol interventions</ENAMEX> in
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> should consume a proportionate amount of
research dollars.
Inadequate access to treatment/ineffective treatment
Effective, low-cost interventions that require minimal
additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to implement are already available. Due to
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> time constraints, so-called "brief
motivational interventions" are the intervention model most likely
to be successfully implemented. No other existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is likely
to be useful in the real-world setting of the typical emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>.
The empirical support for brief interventions is excellent and
does not need further conceptual verification. As suggested by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Medicine</ENAMEX>, the standards for forming a reasonable
consensus leading to a recommendation to provide brief
interventions have already been met<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> already recommend
moving beyond clinical trials to national dissemination<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX> There is
no need to plow new ground and perform research to develop new
interventions for emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> use.
A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> meta-analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> alcohol treatment modalities found
that brief motivational counseling ranks near the top in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
categories:
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) total amount of research to investigate the modality, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
methodological quality of research, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) number of studies
demonstrating improved outcomes, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) cost effectiveness<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX>
Therefore, research should not focus on foundational and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> trials, but on the practical matter of successfully
adapting proven intervention techniques to the emergency department
setting. It is acknowledged that treatment must have documented
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> in particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, the
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> is the entry point for medical care for a
broad spectrum of problem drinkers.
There is little reason to believe that intoxicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
present to the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> represent a special population
to whom current research results do not apply. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems experience an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.32</NUMEX> injury-related
events requiring outpatient or inpatient care per year<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38</NUMEX> Visits to
the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> are so common among substance-abusing
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that it is unlikely they represent a special
treatment-resistant subgroup.
The opposite may be the case. Alcohol-related medical problems,
especially injuries, occur in the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of alcohol
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>. Moderate, and even light drinkers, often require emergency
care because many alcohol-related events are not related to total
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> consumption, but rather to the activities the patient
engages in while drinking and to where, when, and with whom alcohol
is consumed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with severe dependence have a
disproportionate share of alcohol-related medical consequences, but
it is estimated that such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> generate <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a fraction</NUMEX> of all
alcohol-related problems.39
Alcohol-related problems occur at lower rates, but in much
greater numbers, among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with mild to moderate alcohol
problems because such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> constitute the greatest proportion
of the drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Thus, if all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe
problems stopped drinking, a substantial number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
alcohol-related problems would still present to the emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. For example, driving while intoxicated overlaps with
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>, but it constitutes an important issue in its own right
because surveys consistently show that a substantial number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who do not meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse
or dependence admit to having driven an automobile while
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intoxicated</ENAMEX>. For many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, brief interventions
demonstrate significant effects on subsequent alcohol intake and
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> resource utilization when used as stand-alone
treatment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.40</NUMEX>
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> may require more extended treatment. Brief
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX> may play an important role in motivating such
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to accept a treatment referral or can be used to establish
motivation while waiting for access to publicly funded
treatment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.41,42 One</NUMEX> trial, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project Assert</ENAMEX>, provided brief
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX> and used an active referral process to gain access to
the marginal capacity of the substance abuse treatment system for
those who needed additional care<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.43</NUMEX> Its success led to its adoption
by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Medical Center</ENAMEX> as a value-added service in the emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> without insurance may also be referred to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community resources</ENAMEX> and self-help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Those with insurance have
at least some access to treatment services to which they can be
referred.
Emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> may obtain the training
necessary to perform the intervention, but in most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>,
staffing constraints will prevent them from being the primary
providers of this service<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, instilling this knowledge
and sense of responsibility throughout the field will require too
broad a change in service culture for this approach to be readily
adopted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> demands and current practice standards are likely to
limit the role of emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to "setting the
stage" for an intervention.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> suggest that few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> comply with a simple referral to
seek treatment after emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> discharge<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.45</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>,
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> should have dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> on-site who can
provide interventions. This places the responsibility to perform
the intervention in the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are already
committed to providing the service and avoids dependence on
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who are unlikely to acquire such commitment until
significant attitudinal changes occur.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two decades</TIMEX> of mental health services research in primary care
settings support the concept that the most effective method of
delivering psychosocial services is through collaboration between
mental health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> and primary care providers<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.46</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collaborative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> using emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to screen
and mental health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> to perform the intervention is the
approach that is most likely to be widely adopted<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.49</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> use among emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is not likely a
problem that can be tackled by a single discipline.
Interdisciplinary research is more likely to facilitate the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and implementation of emergency department
interventions that work in the real world. Collaborative care has
the potential to benefit both emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and mental
health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> suggest that substance abuse counselors
may find that a medical or surgical crisis increases patient
motivation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.50</NUMEX> As a result, their services may be more effective
when conducted in the emergency department environment. To date,
all published studies on emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> or trauma center
interventions have used the collaborative care
approach<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2,3,34,51</NUMEX>
Financial considerations
Despite the prevalence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use disorders, hospital
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> are likely to raise concerns about hiring additional
staff to conduct interventions because they do not consider
addressing alcohol problems as part of their mission. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and similar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are available, but shifting the
burden to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> will still require hiring additional
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>. It will be necessary to provide evidence that hiring
staff to perform interventions is in the best interests of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX> and is fiscally responsible. Therefore, studies are
needed to assess the nominal costs of implementation and any cost
offsets that occur. This has already occurred in family medicine,
which is currently the medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> with the highest screening
rate.
There is reason to believe that cost-effectiveness can be
demonstrated. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insured patients</ENAMEX>, counseling services are
billable under existing CPT (current procedural terminology) codes
when delivered by qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Studies on brief interventions
conducted in other settings demonstrate that a substantial portion
of the reduction in costs is related to a reduction in use of
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and hospital resources<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,40</NUMEX>
Studies of cost-effectiveness should include not only direct
medical costs, but also societal costs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>, state, and county
sources fund many emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, particularly those in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> areas. It is estimated that direct medical costs constitute
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 15%</NUMEX> of total costs related to substance abuse, with the
remainder being related to problems such as property damage, crime,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">absenteeism</ENAMEX>, and unemployment. Study outcomes should be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multi-dimensional</ENAMEX> and assess a broad array of outcomes because the
true stakeholders are society at large. Research that covers
multiple outcomes in addition to medical ones addresses audiences
with different needs and priorities and encourages their support
for provision of intervention services and financial resources.
Studies should, therefore, use a variety of databases, including
not only emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> records, but also general medical
record reviews and insurance and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare/Medicaid</ENAMEX> claims to detect
outpatient visits. Although claims data provide the most accurate
information about health care use, ensuring adequate follow-up for
purposes of obtaining information from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> self-report is
important because many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not report alcohol-related events
to insurance compa-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nies.40</NUMEX> In order to interest other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>,
such as policymakers and health care providers, additional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">databases</ENAMEX> should be used to assess other
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>: for example, motor vehicle records to detect crashes;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> records to assess criminal activities; and state vital
statistics registries, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security Death</ENAMEX> Index, and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatal Accident Reporting System</ENAMEX> (FARS) to detect mortality.
Health care policy
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> have voiced a common concern about alcohol screening:
the potential denial of reimbursement for medical services provided
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> if they have a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> or drug screen.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniform Individual Accident</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sickness Policy Provision Law</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPPL</ENAMEX>), a model law drafted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of</ENAMEX>
Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioners</ENAMEX> (NAIC) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>, provides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> with this
right. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAIC</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> from the
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX>. It
provides a forum for the development of uniform policy and
addresses the need to coordinate regulation of multi-state
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurer</ENAMEX> shall not be liable for any
loss sustained or contracted in consequence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insured</ENAMEX>'s being
intoxicated or under the influence of any narcotic unless
administered on the advice of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>
adopted the law, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> others have adopted it with provisional
restrictions that apply only to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX>, or to injuries sustained
while committing a felony. However, it is obvious that if screening
is not performed, the provision cannot be applied. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> are
unlikely to screen if it affects their legitimate expectation for
financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remuneration</ENAMEX> for patient care. The main effect of this
law has not been to decrease insurance claims, but to discourage
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> from screening for alcohol problems.52
In practice, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPPL</ENAMEX> applies to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a fraction</NUMEX> of patients
treated in the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are uninsured or
carry policies that do not enforce this provision. However,
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> do not engage in analysis of insurance
contracts before providing care and are therefore unaware of the
type of coverage, if any, carried by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. As a result, fear
of financial loss generally prompts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to treat all
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPPL</ENAMEX> applies to them.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAIC</ENAMEX> recently adopted an amendment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPPL</ENAMEX> which states
(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) "This provision may not be used with respect to a medical
expense policy" and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) "For purposes of this provision, 'medical
expense policy' means an accident and sickness insurance policy
that provides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,
medical and surgical expense coverage." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Conference</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurance Legislators</ENAMEX> (NCOIL), an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of state
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> whose main area of public policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is insurance
legislation and regulation, recently passed a resolution asking
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to repeal the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPPL</ENAMEX>.
The primary instruments of public policy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCOIL</ENAMEX> and the NAIC
are model laws and guidelines. Model legislation forms a uniform
basis from which all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> can deal with regulatory issues. The
basic legislative structure of insurance regulation requires some
degree of uniformity throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are
free to maintain their own insurance codes. They may either adopt
the models intact, modify them to meet their specific needs, or
ignore them. Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> should provide their legislative
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> and insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> with information about how
the UPPL adversely affects their ability to implement alcohol
intervention programs and encourage them to implement the changes
recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAIC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCOIL</ENAMEX>.
A serious concern expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> is that documenting
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use in the medical record has the potential to abridge
patient confidentiality about sensitive issues<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.53</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> abuse disorders may face stigmatization and other
potentially serious consequences if screening results are not
protected. Fear of stigmatization gave rise to federal regulations
and laws protecting information related to substance abuse. The
intent of these regulations is to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to seek
treatment for substance abuse by reducing the risk that they will
be stigmatized. The laws are contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Code</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
Regulations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.F.R. Part</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abuse Patient Records</ENAMEX>.
The regulations apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> that have either an
identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> that provides substance abuse treatment or medical
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> whose primary function is the provision of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and
other drug abuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment
(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.F.R. Part</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 2.11</NUMEX>). The law specifically states that records
generated by emergency and trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are not covered
because their primary function is not to provide substance abuse
counseling. Presumably, this would not harm the congressional
intent of attracting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to treatment because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> do not
come to the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> with the intention of receiving
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substance</ENAMEX> abuse treatment.
If an emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hires staff</ENAMEX> whose primary function is
screening and intervention, the application of this law will need
to be
reconsidered by emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. If a blood
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> level is obtained to facilitate treatment of an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX>, it is not under special protection. However, if it is
obtained in order to engage the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in treatment, the
information is protected under the above federal regulations that
require the express, written permission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> before it
can be shared with others.54 A special "Consent for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confidential Information</ENAMEX>" form must be signed in order for this
information to be released<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.55</NUMEX> Under federal regulations, a general
medical consent form is not sufficient.
Recommendations
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> should increase their
knowledge, skills, and confidence in alcohol screening and
intervention. To accomplish this and change current practice
patterns, studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> interventions should be framed,
focused, and performed by emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Given the magnitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems and the ability of
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who might not otherwise
seek treatment, funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should give high priority to
research on alcohol problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Research support should be primarily for services research,
not the development of new intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> or prototypes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Translational</ENAMEX> studies that develop methods of adapting already
validated interventions into emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> are
needed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> obtained from practically oriented translational
studies will help to develop guidelines for optimal resource
allocation by determining the sub-population of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for whom
brief interventions are most effective. They will also provide a
framework for future investigations that target non-responsive
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in need of more extensive services. Studies should be
conducted using a collaborative process that involves mental health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> and other appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Research is needed on referral strategies for more severely
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impaired</ENAMEX>, non-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, to assist them in gaining access
to resources already available in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. This research
should include studies on the use of no-cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> such as
self-help or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-step
programs using, for example, abbreviated forms of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelve</ENAMEX>
Step <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Facilitation Therapy Manual</ENAMEX>" developed for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">MATCH</ENAMEX>.56 The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-step arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project Match</ENAMEX> had the best outcomes in
the study, regardless of "matching" considerations.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Research studies of cost-effectiveness are needed to
convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> that having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> available
to address alcohol problems is an integral component of the
practice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and part of their mission. Since cost-benefit
analysis is critical to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-coming resistance to implementation,
research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> should include health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> or health
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Emergency and trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, their respective
professional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, and alcohol advocacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> should
contact their state insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX>, state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of health
and human services, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> involved in insurance issues to
urge amending state insurance codes that financially penalize
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who screen for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> should designate specific individuals
to assume the role of obtaining and interpreting screening results
and to provide interventions. This is the most immediately
available policy to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with federal confidentiality
regulations and alleviate legitimate concerns about the right to
privacy.

Response to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gentilello</ENAMEX>'s Presentation
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen M. Hargarten</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPH</ENAMEX>
I am honored to have the opportunity to participate in this
timely conference. It is my belief that our deliberations and
discussion should greatly assist the articulation of a focused,
thoughtful research agenda for addressing alcohol-related problems
in the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>) setting.
My comments are intended to link this research agenda with the
unique, strategic position of the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and to
reflect on the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and care
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">providers</ENAMEX> represented here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. I think this effort reflects the
philosophy of emergency medicine, which seeks out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> for all of the problems that may arise in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>.
I feel strongly that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ED</ENAMEX>-based research agenda should address
the spectrum of problems that present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. Screening
and interventions for alcohol-related problems must be integrated
into the practice of emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and all of the emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s clinical activities. The research agenda's translation
to practice should reflect the spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use and related
problems as well, given that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> is inundated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
have alcohol-related problems. A series of carefully structured,
single questions needs to be developed that can identify at-risk
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, alcohol abusers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alcoholics</ENAMEX>. When I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> began
practicing, the extent of screening consisted of the question, "Are
you a drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>?"
Exciting research now is pinpointing which intervention (really
brief, brief, short-term, long-term) is most effective as well as
where it is most effectively delivered (emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>, and/or treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>). While all of the answers are
not yet known, the progress is encouraging.
It is evident that additional research is needed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) refine
the set of single questions that improve efficacy and efficiency;
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) identify high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, essential to focused, effective
screening; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) match the alcohol-related problem to the
intervention.
This is the essence of the traditional biomedical research
model. I look forward to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> when the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Commission</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> visit includes the requirement to demonstrate our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> and
hospital-based
screening and intervention "toolbox" that addresses this patient
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> with alcohol problems.
Health care settings should be considered safe, effective,
patient-centered, timely, efficient places of equitable care. These
descriptors of health care quality from the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of</ENAMEX>
Medicine report1 should be applied to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
alcohol-related problems.
I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX>'s presentation nicely outlined the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> of the biomedical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> has
made a significant contribution to the insurance industry's
policies toward alcohol-related problems. Many trauma surgeons and
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> oppose alcohol screening in the current
environment because of concerns about non-payment for services. I
appreciate the advances being made to integrate screening into
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, and I agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX>'s assessment
of the barriers to making screening a reality. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX>' and
other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX>' knowledge, skills, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> can all create
barriers.
At this point, I want to depart from the biomedical research
model to discuss the importance of an epidemiologic shift towards
population health. I feel that the research agenda should also
integrate the public health model. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> is in a strategic
position to inform the public and policymakers about the scope and
nature of alcohol-related problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. An epidemiologic
shift from screening to surveillance, from individual patients
inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>, will serve
to understand at-risk behaviors of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and the
environment in which these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">groups interface</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>.
Policy-relevant studies are needed to address the marketing,
distribution, and sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> to high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and
environments. Research that examines pricing schemes and marketing
strategies that are associated with college-based binge drinking is
needed. A set of single policy-relevant questions should be
routinely asked such as, "Where did you buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>?" and
"Where were you drinking before you were injured<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" Linking the
abuse/individual behavior questions to when and where the alcohol
was consumed has important implications. Research that evaluates
policy interventions linked with reliable, accurate surveil-lance
information can influence policy changes such as lowering the legal
limit of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> or extending DWI laws to cover snowmobile
driving.
Research on changing social norms for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use and abuse is
needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, given that alcohol-related
problems are still largely viewed as a social issue, not a medical
problem. Addressing emergency medicine training will be very
challenging since emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> might have their
own social norms of at risk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> usage that will influence their
effectiveness and interest.
The emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>-based research agenda need not be
limited to the biomedical model. It should be extended to include
health services research and access to matched, therapeutic
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. It should also use the public health model
(addressing behavior, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>/ <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, and the environment), and
the injury control <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> (prevention, acute care, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rehabilitation</ENAMEX>). By using different models, the research agenda can
address treatment and policy issues and develop and evaluate
prevention strategies at the primary, secondary, and tertiary
levels. Ultimately, this multiple approach will help us to reach
our shared goal of fewer alcohol-related deaths and injuries.

Comments on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Implementing Preventive Interventions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency</ENAMEX>
Medicine: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Considerations</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda C. Degutis</ENAMEX>, DrPH
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> has raised many important issues in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.
Many of them point to the lack of knowledge of the evidence that
screening and intervention for and treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems
can be effective in decreasing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality. This is
certainly an area where we can be proactive in highlighting the
evidence that these strategies work, and for those who are
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, in modeling behaviors that include screening,
intervention, and referral for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who have alcohol-related
problems.
Other areas also need to be addressed, and some definitions need
to be clarified. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> performed a MEDLINE
review using the term "<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>." While this term may refer to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, it does not necessarily
capture at-risk drinking or hazardous drinking patterns. It will
not capture the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> who drinks <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> a few times
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>, drives a motor vehicle, and is injured in a crash. Using
the term "alcohol" and searching the indexes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the primary
emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annals of Emergency Medicine</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic Emergency Medicine</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121</NUMEX> citations were selected for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years 1990-2000</TIMEX>. Of these, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> were original articles that either
had "alcohol" in the title or were clearly examining
alcohol-related problems. There was also a trend toward an
increasing number of articles published in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX>. Only
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> article appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> were published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.
Several other articles published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> discussed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> as a
risk factor for particular injuries or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic</ENAMEX>
Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX>, which is published by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for Academic</ENAMEX>
Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX>, published <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> that included
recommendations for screening and intervention for alcohol problems
in the emergency department<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1,2</NUMEX> So, it does not seem that editorial
boards are not accepting articles about alcohol problems. Perhaps
the issue is that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> in this area is small,
and therefore few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> are submitted.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> makes several recommendations in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. He
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that the studies need to be framed, focused, and performed
by emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> using a collaborative process. It
is necessary that emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> perform research in this
area, but the contribution of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> should not be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">negated</ENAMEX>, nor should other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> be discouraged from working
in this area. What is important is that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> approach be taken to
build upon the strengths of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> research methodologists,
epidemiologists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX>, social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>, and others who
have specific contributions to make.
Focusing research support on health services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> is
important, but the opportunities to develop new methods of
intervention should not be eliminated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Translational</ENAMEX> studies will
help in the adaptation of interventions in emergency medicine
practice, but interventions evolve over time, and new methods are
developed and tested. Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> should participate in this
research. Researching strategies for engaging emergency department
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in treatment, especially those with high recidivism rates,
would be of tremendous benefit to the field of emergency medicine.
Examining cost-effectiveness is also important, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>
are constantly asked to do more with less, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> face the
threat of cuts in essential services in order to trim budgets.
With respect to policy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> deserves a great deal of
credit for the work that he has done with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurance Commissioners</ENAMEX> (NAIC) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Conference of</ENAMEX>
Insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Legislators</ENAMEX> (NCOIL). He has been very effective in
convincing them that it is necessary to change their policies so
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> would not fear that screening for alcohol
problems could place their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in jeopardy of losing insurance
coverage. Other policy questions need to be answered as well. Would
reimbursement for screening and brief intervention increase
screening and intervention, and subsequently, decrease morbidity
and mortality? To what extent do emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have
coverage for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and other drug problems, and how does this
affect their ability to enter treatment when they are referred?
Have state substance abuse parity laws decreased the number of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who need to seek treatment through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> rather than other
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX>? What degree of confidentiality can be assured with
respect to records of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> screening and intervention in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>,
and how does this affect screening and intervention rates?
As we already know, this is a complex problem that probably does
not have simple solutions. I think that some clarifications are
necessary to ensure we are using common language and common
definitions. In the field of injury epidemiology and injury
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>, we try to avoid the use of the term "accidents" and
instead use terms such as "injury events." When describing patients
who have manifested problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, we should use
definitions such as "at-risk drinking," "abuse," and "dependence"
to define the continuum of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems that we see. We also
need to be clear about the disease processes that we are interested
in studying. To many health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, the term "trauma"
means something very different than the term "injury." "Trauma"
often connotes injuries of significant severity to require
treatment by specialized care providers, whereas "injury" often is
perceived as meaning relatively minor physical injury. The term
"injury" is more inclusive and should be used, as "trauma" is a
subset of injury. If we cannot converse with and understand one
another, there is little hope that we can effectively deliver our
message outside of our field.
There are additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> to doing research in the
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> setting, created by the physical environment,
the practice environment, the ever-increasing demand for emergency
care as evidenced by increases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> visits, and the financial
constraints that affect the type of real-world interventions that
can be implemented and evaluated. In addition, we often have
difficulties with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> (IRB) approvals, as
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems are still viewed as sensitive issues, and some
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRBs</ENAMEX> are uncomfortable approving this type of research.
The field of emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> is young and evolving and
developing its evidence base for clinical practice. This is leading
to much debate among emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> about their role in
providing preventive services. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for Academic Emergency</ENAMEX>
Medicine is addressing these issues through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Health Task</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>, as well as through sessions at its annual meeting and
articles in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic Emergency Medicine</ENAMEX>. Research in this area is
in its very early stages.
Because the field of emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> is young, large numbers
of established <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> do not exist. To increase research
capacity, we need to teach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> how to do the research through
fellowships, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX> development programs and grants, mentored
research awards, and other programs that foster the development of
new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>.
Translational research, as well as the communication of findings
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and evaluation of implementation, is another
challenge. Funding for translational research has been inadequate,
as has a focus on sustainability of interventions that are
implemented, once an evaluation has ended. Along with encouraging
the implementation of effective interventions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> setting, it
is also necessary to develop strategies to ensure sustainability of
those interventions.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> area of research that has not received much attention in our
discussions over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two days</TIMEX> is that of policy research. This
type of research tends to focus on population impact, rather than
on impact on the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> or practitioner. Often,
policies are created and implemented with no study of their
effectiveness or the unintended consequences that arise from their
implementation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> has highlighted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specific policy
area, but there are many other policy directions that must be
evaluated. These policies may be public or private and may be
implemented on the institutional, local, state, or national level.
For example, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, we recently lost funding for
transporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to substance abuse treatment services. It is
not hard to imagine the impact of this, but it was only in
examining the cost to referring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that a movement to
reinstate the funding began. Now our task is to identify more
cost-effective ways of providing the needed services before funding
is cut yet again.
We are currently involved in the evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connecticut Public</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Act 98-201</ENAMEX>, which has several provisions.3 The primary goal of this
legislation is to implement universal screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and
other drug problems among injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to acute care
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>. Other provisions include development of model continuing
education standards for health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and plans for
including training about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and other drug problems in the
standard curricula for health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> attending institutions
of higher learning. The original law signed by the governor
required screening of all injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to an acute
care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> as well as injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who required the
activation of a trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> response or who were transferred to or
from an acute care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. Many emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> in the
state interpreted the law to mean that they would have to perform
screening of injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting to the emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. They vehemently objected to this policy and were able
to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> include a technical correction that
clarified that screening is required
among injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who are admitted to acute care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
as inpatients, rather than implying that all injured patients
presenting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> be screened. Given this reaction by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX>, are we ready to ask for broader implementation of these
policies?
The lack of acceptance of screening as a routine part of
practice is only one of the barriers that we face. Policies have
been developed on the basis of evidence that treatment for
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">addiction</ENAMEX> is effective. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have passed substance abuse
treatment parity legislation that requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">insurers</ENAMEX> to cover
treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> (AOD) problems to the same
extent that they cover treatment for other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. There is no
federal legislation to this effect so the result is that in states
that have parity laws, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are still not guaranteed
comparable coverage for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AOD</ENAMEX> treatment because their insurance plans
are governed by federal law under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Employee's Retirement Income</ENAMEX>
Security Act (ERISA). In addition, some insurance plans do not
offer any coverage for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AOD</ENAMEX> problems so the parity statutes do not
apply to them. Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who lack health insurance have
even more limited access to treatment.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are under the jurisdiction of the criminal
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">justice</ENAMEX> system have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AOD</ENAMEX> problems. In addition, evidence exists that
treatment of these problems leads to a decrease in crime. But,
little has been done to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved in this system
receive necessary treatment for their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Instead, there is
often a tendency to criminalize addiction and to "treat" the
problem through arrests and prison terms. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, require that anyone who is incapacitated by alcohol be
transported to an acute care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> rather than jail. The intent
of this law was to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> and to
avoid the consequences of unrecognized severe problems with
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. Currently, emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> see many
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute alcohol intoxication on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis, but
funds for treatment are limited.
The education of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> in the process of screening and
brief intervention is another area that needs study. To promulgate
a standardized approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> problems, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Cardiac Life</ENAMEX> Support course was developed. Similarly, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Trauma Life</ENAMEX> Support course provides a standardized
approach to the initial care of the injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Both of these
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courses</ENAMEX>, as well as others such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Pediatric Life Support</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prehospital Trauma Life Support</ENAMEX>
combine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">didactic sessions</TIMEX> with skill-building sessions to
improve practitioner knowledge and skills in these areas. Perhaps
we need to develop a similar approach for screening and
intervention-an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Alcohol Problem Identification</ENAMEX> and
Intervention course.
Despite the evidence of the relationship between alcohol and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">injury</ENAMEX>, we still do not have strong support for screening and
intervention from our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> who deliver trauma care. In the
most recent version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of Surgeons</ENAMEX> monograph
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optimal Care</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Injured Patient</ENAMEX>, which describes standards of
care for verification of trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, the requirement that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trauma</ENAMEX> centers be able to perform <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> testing was
eliminated<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> The message this sends may be interpreted in several
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>: a) there is not a sufficient relationship between alcohol and
injury to justify testing for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use in injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>;
b) issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use among injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are not in the
purview of the trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>; c) nothing can be done to address the
issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> problems among injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> so testing does
not help; or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) not testing protects the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and the
practitioner from various legal issues.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> recommends the development of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ED alcohol</ENAMEX>
research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. While his idea of highlighting this area of
research holds great merit, operationalization is problematic. If
there is an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ED alcohol</ENAMEX> research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, will there also be a
primary care alcohol research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a trauma alcohol research
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, and a critical care alcohol research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>? His proposal,
rather than bringing the field together, can lead to fragmentation
within the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who are doing work in this
area.
The importance of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> with public health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, alcohol <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, community-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, and others has been discussed. It is important that
we look at the impact of interventions not only in the academic
environment that is populated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faculty</ENAMEX>,
but also in community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> and rural settings. We need to
explore the impact of interventions in settings such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Service</ENAMEX> that serve distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
Finally, I would like to address the issue of funding. Much of
the research that is being done in this area is not supported by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX>, but by other federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Highway Traffic Safety</ENAMEX>
Administration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Substance Abuse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mental Health Services</ENAMEX>
Administration, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Resources and Services</ENAMEX>
Administration. We need to consider the impact of the funding
policies of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> both in promoting research and in
growing the field of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> research in emergency medicine. The
smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> often include indirect costs as well as direct
costs within the budget cap for a particular project. While this
may not be problematic in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> with an indirect rate of
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, it is very difficult for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> at an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> with
an indirect rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> or higher to compete, as much of the budget
is taken up by indirect costs. In addition, this type of funding
policy discourages the research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> from collaborating with
academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> perceive that the bulk of
the budget is going to some administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with whom they
have no interaction and who has no interest in what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
are doing.
In summary, alcohol problems are a significant issue for
emergency department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. A growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of evidence
demonstrates that interventions in the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> are
effective and that treatment referral can work. The opportunities
for research in this area are great, and we need to work to develop
research capacity. There is a need for interdisciplinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> who can draw on one another's knowledge and strengths.
Although funding strategies can be improved, funding is available
for this work. We have already come a long way, and much is left to
do.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Discussion</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Runge</ENAMEX> agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gentilello</ENAMEX> that health
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> should be part of the research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. He noted that we
must demonstrate the value of interventions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrators</ENAMEX> if we want extra <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> for interventions. He also
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">echoed Gentilello</ENAMEX>'s comment about the need to individualize
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>. In his multi-center study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interventionists</ENAMEX> felt
restricted by a standard intervention, sensing that variation was
needed to meet different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>' needs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX> said that research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methodologists</ENAMEX> want interventions
to be standardized so that they know why a treatment is working.
However, if they cannot use those interventions in their clinical
setting, the interventions are of no use.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elinor Walker</ENAMEX> commented that something about an intervention
must be standardized in order to assess its cost-effectiveness.
Gentilello suggested that the salaries of full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
could provide cost data and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> tests and admission rates
could provide effectiveness data.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Degutis</ENAMEX> added that interventions have to be monitored. If
a standardized intervention is not used, audio tapes can at least
give an idea of how it works.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Soderstrom</ENAMEX> agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX> that alcohol-related
research must be published not in substance abuse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, but in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">publications</ENAMEX> read by emergency and trauma surgery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. For
example, he noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American College of Surgeons' Resources</ENAMEX>
for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Optimal Care of the Injured Patient</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, which contains
guidelines for the certification of trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, omitted the
requirement to test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood alcohol</ENAMEX> content for the first
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>. He admitted that many times a positive blood
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> test in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with head injuries can be trouble-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX>.
However, when he explored the reasons for the omission, he found
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that wrote the latest version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of Surgeons</ENAMEX> resource <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> did not have access to data that
proved that treatment had any value. Regarding the issue of
non-payment for services provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>-impaired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, he
observed
that insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> rarely take advantage of their current
legal right to deny payment due to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> use.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hargarten</ENAMEX> said that screening for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> applies not
only to the potential for interventions, but also to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
overall quality of care, including safety from injury due to
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol impairment</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> withdrawal during the acute
phase of treatment for medical or surgical conditions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> observed that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> in trauma journals
have earned him a great deal of attention and have raised
awareness. He said that changes in emergency medicine practice will
require publication of studies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> that reach emergency
medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip Brewer</ENAMEX> noted that at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society for</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academic Emergency Medicine</ENAMEX> (SAEM), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> dealing with substance
abuse were spread over other categories such as geriatrics and
injury. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the goals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Substance Abuse Interest Group of</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAEM</ENAMEX> was to authorize a substance abuse category for abstracts and
sessions at the annual meeting. To date, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAEM</ENAMEX> has not agreed to a
separate category. The idea of prevention in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> has
taken root for injury and domestic violence, he said, but not yet
for substance abuse.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Rostenberg</ENAMEX> agreed that forsaking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAC</ENAMEX> prevents good
management and good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. At his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, attending physicians
are responsible for dealing with the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> screens and
they receive a letter when they fail to do so. He observed that
this system had been effective largely because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> had seen
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> recover.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Longabaugh</ENAMEX> urged that collaborative studies include
health services <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>. He noted that there is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01</NUMEX>
interactive project that allows for great collaboration across
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disciplines</ENAMEX>. He also encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to continue publishing
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> about their own areas of expertise. Although he, too,
had concerns about standardized manuals, he noted that studies show
that such manuals do not result in poorer treatments. He suggested
the use of decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the manuals, which can lend more
flexibility to clinical applications of research. Depending on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and the setting, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> can be traveled very quickly and
adapted quickly as well.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX> agreed that we should all keep publishing in our
various disciplines. However, he reiterated that if we do not
publish in trauma and emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, practices will
not change. He said it is easier to change a field from within than
from the outside. He also emphasized the importance of funding
emergency medicine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>, not just alcohol <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, to
conduct this research.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Brown</ENAMEX> observed that although the grant review process at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> can be difficult, the experience of re-submitting grants has
strengthened his work. The process can be a learning opportunity
and result in more sound research. He speculated that if many
dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can have spontaneous remissions, then research
on whether brief interventions could help them seems warranted.
However, he thought that guidelines to require screening in
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> were premature, particularly without funding
to support required changes. Instead, he advocated implementing
demonstration projects that use different models. Consistent
evaluation across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> would determine if they actually make
a difference. He thought that without this type of research,
requirements would cause a rebellion against practice changes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hargarten</ENAMEX> noted that it has not been long since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint</ENAMEX>
Commission on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations</ENAMEX> (JCAHO)
mandated policies and procedures to enhance domestic violence
screening and intervention in every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. He thinks
screening for alcohol problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> is on the horizon. In order
to get reasonable requirements and uniform adherence in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, it will be necessary for an external <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JCAHO</ENAMEX> to be thinking about this now. In the meantime, we need to be
doing research that will make sure that appropriate requirements
are adopted. With respect to the methodological issues, we must
balance rigorous follow-through and long-term studies with studies
that are germane to emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>. Collaboration with
rigorous methodologists is important, but those collaborations have
to focus on what can be accomplished specifically in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>
setting.
Gentilello clarified that he had not criticized the peer-review
process, but that panels reviewing alcohol interventions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX>
should include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of emergency medicine. Grant review
panels should consider proposals from the perspective of the
emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, not the perspective of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrist</ENAMEX>, who
probably has not been in
an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. Since alcohol interventions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> cut
across different disciplines, the peer-review <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> should embrace
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple perspectives</ENAMEX>. Methodologies that work in the emergency
department come from deciding what is feasible in that environment
and adapting interventions that have been shown effective in other
clinical settings. Results from such studies will be used.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Fiellin</ENAMEX> recommended using current mechanisms like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars</ENAMEX> program to train <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
in methodology, clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">epidemiology</ENAMEX>, and health services research
so that review <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> will include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who are
knowledgeable about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> setting and clinical research.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hargarten</ENAMEX> endorsed that idea, but added that there was little
funding for training in clinical research in emergency
medicine.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX> agreed that lack of funding was a problem. Many young
surgeons become interested in alcohol interventions and write
grants, but when their studies are not funded, they lose interest
and move on to other subjects.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Maio</ENAMEX> cautioned that we should not abandon the randomized,
controlled trial (RCT). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX>'s results had a powerful impact
on trauma surgeons because his study was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX>. When we adapt
proven interventions to new settings, we change many factors so we
need to have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX>. He recalled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, when many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> procedures
were adapted for use in the field by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX> without appropriate
evaluation. Now, it is difficult to justify many of those changes.
Regarding collaboration, he mentioned that partnering with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> in substance abuse gave him a greater understanding of
that specialty and increased the quality and credibility of
subsequent proposals. He said an NIAAA fellowship is one way of
getting further training.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Pollock</ENAMEX> wondered how we could use research as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> for
positive change in the clinical setting. He recounted that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX>'s goal for research was to modify interventions that
work in other settings for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> rather than creating new
ones. He asked what types of outcomes would indicate successful
adaptation. Would they be patient outcomes or process measures?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> replied that the outcome depends on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. For
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">addiction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychiatrists</ENAMEX>, an outcome of reduced
drinking would probably be appropriate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surgeons</ENAMEX> would probably be
influenced more by an outcome of reduced readmissions to the trauma
service. He surmised, therefore, that reduction in recidivism might
be a suitable outcome for emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollock</ENAMEX> asked how to differentiate that type of study from doing
a clinical trial.
Gentilello suggested that clinical trials are important because
they change practice. He thought a successful multi-center trial
could lead to the creation of a standard of care.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Bernstein</ENAMEX> observed that one site cannot address all the
questions raised at this conference. He suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Alcohol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Screening Day</ENAMEX>, an NIAAA-sponsored event, is an opportunity
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> to collaborate in evaluating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AUDIT</ENAMEX>
screening instrument in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. It could be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step toward
multi-center studies. He also believed that research should have
policy implications and that funding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> should require this
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">applicability</ENAMEX>. He suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIAAA</ENAMEX> reclaim indirect grant costs
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that did not implement positive findings from
their research.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ries</ENAMEX> responded to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX>'s indirect cost proposal by
endorsing a doubling of indirect costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that
adopted positive findings as standard operating procedures after
the grant period was over. This would reward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> for
putting clinical preventive services into practice. He reasoned we
should prefer motivational strategies. He observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> during
the conference that control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in intervention studies get much
alcohol-related assessment, which can act as an intervention. He
also agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gentilello</ENAMEX> that decreased alcohol intake might not
be as important an outcome to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> as decreased re-visits to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>. Since brief interventions only lead to modest changes in
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol intake</ENAMEX>, perhaps studies should focus on re-injury or health
care use as the primary outcome. Then follow-up interviews would
have to do less alcohol intake assessment, and that would mean less
intervention effect on the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
Gentilello concurred, commenting that insurance claims data can
be a useful source of follow-up data, as can a simple phone call to
inquire whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> recently.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl Cherpitel</ENAMEX> related difficulties as a non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MD</ENAMEX> publishing in
medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>. She wondered if articles by non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDs</ENAMEX> would be
taken seriously by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who work in clinical areas. If they
would, medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> might need to be educated to accept
articles from non-MDs. If non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, alcohol methodologists could
publish more easily in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, they could have a bigger
impact on practices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ED</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gentilello</ENAMEX> remarked that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> for surgical
journals vary considerably. He once submitted an article with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
confidence intervals and it was rejected because it had no p
values. He related that his alcohol studies used to be returned
without being reviewed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reviewers</ENAMEX> have become more accepting. They
no longer require him to strike any references that show alcohol
treatment is effective. He believes that trauma research requires
multi-disciplinary input and that research by non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDs</ENAMEX> is taken
seriously. However, getting that work published requires
persistence. Submitting this work helps educate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reviewers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hargarten</ENAMEX> observed that the impediments to publishing seem to be
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lessening</ENAMEX>, and that the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cherpitel</ENAMEX> and others is vital.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soderstrom</ENAMEX> noted that large grants provide a great deal of data.
Papers that are clinically applicable to functioning practice in
the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and the trauma center belong in those
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>. He asserted that papers on methodology or more complex
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> need to be included in other appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brewer</ENAMEX> commented that having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> published is different from
having an impact on clinical practice. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in emergency
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX> are seen in non-academic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> in these
environments may doubt the applicability of research done in
academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. He suggested we need research on how to get
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> to screen in the emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the ways
we get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to do this is to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JCAHO</ENAMEX> to require it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Hungerford</ENAMEX> observed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond-Kotelchuck</ENAMEX> model
suggests that changes in practice result from effort applied to all
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>-political will, social strategy, and
knowledge base. It might seem that research activities apply only
to the knowledge base aspect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. However, important
research activities need to be carried out in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> elements of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Woolard</ENAMEX> favored continuing intervention research in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX>.
He believed that the realities of our practice settings help drive
the development of new ways of delivering counseling, for example,
computer-based methods. While emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> may not have the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> or interest, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> do. He suggested that research in
trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDs</ENAMEX> can help alcohol <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> learn more
about the interventions they have already developed and can even
lead to novel interventions.
