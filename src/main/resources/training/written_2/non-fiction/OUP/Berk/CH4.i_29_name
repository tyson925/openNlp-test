<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days a week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX> leaves his office <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX> early to take charge of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX>, while her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, a university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX>, teaches a late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. One balmy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin retrieved Sophie</ENAMEX> at her child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and drove the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-minute</TIMEX> route home. Invited to look in on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophieâ</ENAMEX>€™s play, I met the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> at the front door and nestled into a rocking chair from which to observe unobtrusively.
After downing the last bite of her snack, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> grabbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kevinâ</ENAMEX>€™s hand and led him across the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to a rug lined on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by shelves ï¬lled with books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stuffed animals</ENAMEX>, and other play props. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> moved a toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> inside a small, enclosed fence that she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX> had put together <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day before</TIMEX>. Then she turned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> on their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and moved them toward each other.
â€œWhy are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and cow lying down?â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX> asked.
<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œâ€™Cause theyâ€™re tired</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Sophie</ENAMEX> answered, pushing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> closer together.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œOh</ENAMEX>, yes,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Kevin</ENAMEX> affirmed. Then, building on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sophieâ€™s</ENAMEX> theme, he placed a teddy bear on another part of the rug and offered, â€œI think Tedâ€™s tired, too. Iâ€™m going to start a bed over here for some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> turned toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">teddy bear</ENAMEX>, lifted his paw, and exclaimed, â€œShe wants a lollipop to hold in her hand!â€
â€œA lollipop in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hand</ENAMEX>? We havenâ€™t got any lollipops, have we?â€ answered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œLaura has!â€</ENAMEX> declared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX>, glancing at me.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œHas Laura</ENAMEX> got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lollipop?â€ Kevin queried</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œYes</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheâ€™s</ENAMEX> got all of those, and a swing and a table, too!â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> remarked, referring to my chair, which rocked back and forth next to an end table.
â€œMaybe this could be a make-believe lollipop,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>, placing a round piece on the end of a long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TinkerToy</ENAMEX> stick and handing the structure to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophie</ENAMEX>
â€œThatâ€™s a lollipop,â€ agreed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX>, placing it in the paw of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">teddy bear</ENAMEX>.
â€œCan she suck that while sheâ€™s going off to sleep?â€ asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>. â€œDo you think thatâ€™s what she wants?â€
â€œItâ€™s a paciï¬er,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> explained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX>, renaming the object.
â€œA paciï¬er, do you think? The paciï¬er might help her get to sleep,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Kevin</ENAMEX> conï¬rmed.
â€œThis long, long paciï¬er,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Sophie</ENAMEX> answered, picking up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">TinkerToy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, looking at its long stick, and pausing as if to decide what to do next.
â€œLeprechaun is looking pretty tired,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>, laying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sophieâ€™s stuffed leprechaun</ENAMEX> next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">teddy bear</ENAMEX>. â€œWhat do you think?â€
â€œHe wants a lollipop, too!â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œOh</ENAMEX>, he wants a lollipop as well. What are we going to use for a lollipop for the leprechaun?â€ asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>.
Pressing the teddy bearâ€™s and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">leprechaunâ€™s arms</ENAMEX> together and the lollipop-turned-paciï¬er between them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> readily came up with a solution. â€œHeâ€™s sharing,â€ she affirmed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œOh</ENAMEX>, theyâ€™ll share! All right,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Kevin</ENAMEX> agreed.
This scene is but a small excerpt from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kevinâ€™s</ENAMEX> joint play session, which persisted for more than an hourâ€”a remarkably long time for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-year-old</TIMEX> to sustain any activity. Yet when the TV set is switched off and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are free to do as they choose, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> readily become absorbed in pretending. At times, their involvement is so intense that on being interrupted they react with shock and dismay, rejecting an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> who otherwise would be welcomed with joy and affection. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> reported to me that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattie</ENAMEX> reserved the period after she awoke <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the morning</TIMEX> for conversing with dolls and other imaginary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> entered too soon to help her wash and dress, she dismissed the intruder, proclaiming sharply, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">â€œBusy</ENAMEX>! Donâ€™t stop my dollies!â€ Only smooth and clever entry into the make-believe activityâ€”for example, inviting the dolls and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stuffed animals</ENAMEX> to get up for breakfastâ€”could lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mattie</ENAMEX> into starting the â€œrealâ€ part of her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> without protest.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of early childhood are often called the high season of imaginative play, and aptly so, since make-believe blossoms during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, evolving from simple, imitative acts into highly elaborate, imaginative plots involving complex coordination of roles. Eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> of the past attached great importance to the role of make-believe play in early development. All were convinced that anything so compelling and engrossing in the life of the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> must be profoundly signiï¬cant.


the role of make-believe play in childrenâ€™s lives

Among inï¬‚uential explanations of why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> are so drawn to pretending, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freudâ</ENAMEX>€™s psychoanalytic theory and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piagetâ</ENAMEX>€™s cognitive theory held sway for much of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twentieth century</TIMEX>. Although each has made valuable contributions to our understanding, a new, more powerful view of the meaning of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ€™s</ENAMEX> play has arrived on the scene, thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s sociocultural theory.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Psychoanalytic View: Wish Fulfillment</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insight</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Roles</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud</ENAMEX> regarded make-believe play as a form of pleasurable wish fulï¬llment that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to act out uncertainties, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxieties</ENAMEX>, and hoped for outcomes and, therefore, to master frightening and frustrating events. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX> noted, often revisit anxiety-provoking experiences, such as a trip to the doctorâ€™s office or discipline by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, but with roles reversed so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is in command and compensates for unpleasant happenings. Sophieâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, aware of the previous dayâ€™s events, might have judged her pretend focus on bedtime, lollipops, and paciï¬ers to contain at least an element of wish fulï¬llment. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The evening</TIMEX> before, they had told her, â€œOnly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lolly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy dish</ENAMEX>,â€ and she had complained at having to go to bed while her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> continued to talk and laugh with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Psychoanalyst Erik Erikson</ENAMEX> built on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freudâ</ENAMEX>€™s vision, expanding his picture of make-believe. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erikson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> draw on fantasy play to ï¬nd out about themselves and their social world<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> In all cultures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> act out family roles and highly visible occupationsâ€”police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> in our society; rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> and potter among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopi Indians</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hut</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spear</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> among the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baka of West Africa</ENAMEX>.2 As they do so, they enter a small social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> must cooperate to achieve common goals. And through observing and emulating admired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult ï¬gures</ENAMEX>, preschoolers internalize social norms and gain a sense of their future, of what they can become and how they can contribute to society. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Piagetâ€™s View: Exercising a New Symbolic Capacity</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> acknowledged the emotional function of play, and he agreed that through pretending, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> become familiar with social-role possibilities. But he is best known for stressing the symbolic nature of make-believe. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pretending</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> pointed out, is a vital means of mentally representing the world that, along with gestures, language, and drawings, develops rapidly in early childhood. Through it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> practice and strengthen their capacity to represent their experiences<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> For example, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> pretended to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to bed and used a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TinkerToy</ENAMEX> to stand for a lollipop, she represented in her mind what formerly she could experience only directlyâ€”by going to bed or sucking a lollipop. Practicing and solidifying modes of representation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> emphasized, make it possible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to free thought from the here and now; create larger images of reality that take into account past, present, and future; and transform those images mentally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of logical thinking. 
Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> was convinced that by itself, make-believe play does little to advance childrenâ€™s development. Rather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> merely exercise playfully the symbols they have acquired in other contexts<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> Much like his view of private speech as egocentric and nonsocial, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piaget</ENAMEX> believed that at ï¬rst pretend play is a solitary activity in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> uses highly personal symbols that cannot easily be interpreted by others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sociodramatic</ENAMEX> play, involving joint make-believe with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget</ENAMEX> claimed, is not under way until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3</TIMEX>. As with other aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piagetâ</ENAMEX>€™s theory, the direction of development for make-believe is from purely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, egocentric symbols to social play and shared understanding.
Yet think back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sophieâ€™s</ENAMEX> pretending. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> is socially engaged throughout! From the start, she draws <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX> into the activity, explains her pretend actions so he can build on them, and responds cooperatively and appropriately to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kevinâ</ENAMEX>€™s suggestions, as he does to hers. Vygotskyâ€™s theory has been the wellspring of our recent appreciation of the profoundly social nature of even very young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">childrenâ€™s imaginative playâ</ENAMEX>€”and its wide-ranging inï¬‚uence on cognitive and social development.

<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vygotskyâ€™s View</ENAMEX>: A Zone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proximal Development</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> viewed make-believe play as crucial in childrenâ€™s learning<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> He regarded it as a unique, broadly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">inï¬‚uential â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> try out a wide variety of challenging skills and acquire many culturally valued competencies. Consider the following frequently quoted remarks, taken from a brief lecture in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> eloquently summed up his conviction that pretend play is a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in childrenâ€™s development:

[Make-believe] play creates a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of proximal development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. In play, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> always behaves beyond his average age, above his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> behavior; in play it is as though he were a head taller than himself. As in the focus of a magnifying glass, play contains all developmental tendencies in condensed form and is itself a major source of development<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> 

Why did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> say that make-believe play creates a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is â€œa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> taller than himselfâ€? If we stop every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX> to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at play, we can see what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> meant. Recall how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophie</ENAMEX> satisï¬ed both teddy bearâ€™s and leprechaunâ€™s desire for a lollipop, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">TinkerToy</ENAMEX> lollipop was available. She had them share, a very mature response for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-year-old</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX> life, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX>, like many Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> her age, ï¬nds sharing to be difficult. 
As another illustration, consider <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, who has trouble sitting still during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> storytime in kindergarten. He leans over and talks to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. In spite of the teacherâ€™s frequent prompting, he canâ€™t stay seated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than a couple of minutes</TIMEX>. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> plays <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> with several of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, he can sit and pay attention for much longerâ€”perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">as long as 10 minutes</TIMEX>. Play provides the roles, rules, and scenarios that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enable David</ENAMEX> to concentrate at a much higher level than he typically does in nonpretend contexts.


unique features of make-believe play

How do the make-believe scenes just described, and others like them, serve as major sources of development? To answer this question, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> pointed out, we must identify the distinctive features of make-believe playâ€”those that make it unique among young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ€™s</ENAMEX> experiences. 
The widespread belief, originating with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freud</ENAMEX>, that play is pleasurable wish fulï¬llment characterizes certain playful pursuitsâ€”for example, acting out high-status roles, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, and thereby exercising authority over others instead of being directed and controlled. But not all fantasy qualiï¬es as wish fulï¬llment. In the sociodramatic scenarios that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> create, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> must have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to inoculate, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> must have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to discipline, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> must have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> to do assignments. Make-believe roles are not equally pleasurableâ€”a feature of cooperation that is as true in everyday life as it is in fantasy play. 
Even when make-believe does fulï¬ll a childâ€™s wishes, such pleasure is not unique to play. Many other activities, such as eating a favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">treat</ENAMEX>, being granted the undivided attention and affection of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, and listening to an exciting story, are at least as gratifying and sometimes more so than pretending. Indeed, imaginative wish fulï¬llment can, at times, be counterproductive. In well-known research on childrenâ€™s ability to delay gratiï¬cation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Mischel</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX> showed preschoolers some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious marshmallows</ENAMEX> and told them that they could have one now or several if they waited until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who spent the waiting period in a wish-fulï¬llment mode, thinking about what it would be like to eat those tasty marshmallows, were far less likely to wait patiently and successfully than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who turned their attention away from the treats and thought about other things.7 In this situation and others, being caught up in fantasized wish fulï¬llment interferes with attaining larger, more rewarding outcomes in real lifeâ€”ones that would have been realized had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> been able to exercise imaginative self-restraint. 
What about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piagetâ</ENAMEX>€™s belief that through make-believe, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> solidify their new symbolic capacity? A burgeoning ability to use symbols certainly contributes to the emergence of make-believe, and (as weâ€™ll soon see) make-believe does much to extend young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ</ENAMEX>€™s symbolic skills. Nevertheless, mental representation is yet another feature that is not exclusive to play. As we have already noted, it also characterizes gestures, language, and artistic pursuits as well as beginning literacyâ€”preschoolersâ€™ ï¬rst efforts to make sense of written symbols.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> concluded that make-believe play has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crucial features that distinguish it from other childhood activities. First, the creation of imaginary situations in play helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> separate internal ideas from the objects and events for which they stand. Once young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> realize that words, gestures, and other symbols are distinct from external reality, they are well on the way to using those representations as effective mental tools, calling on them to overcome impulses. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a careful look at childrenâ€™s pretend scenarios reveals that make-believe play is, above all, rule-based play. Inspired by experiences in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> continually devise and follow social rules in imaginary situations. In doing so, they strive to bring their behavior in line with social expectations and acquire the rules of social life. 
Consider these unique, complementary ingredients of make-believe. The ï¬rst strengthens childrenâ€™s internal capacity to become civilized and socially responsible. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with powerful external pressures to act in socially desirable ways. Together, these features make fantasy play a supreme contributor to the development of self-regulationâ€”one that extends the impact of adult teaching and example more than any other early childhood activity. To understand make-believe playâ€™s role in development, letâ€™s take a closer look at each of its unique features.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overcoming Impulsive Action</ENAMEX>

Fantasy play makes its appearance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second year</TIMEX> of life, a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must start to suppress impulses and accept that certain desires will remain unsatisï¬ed. In infancy, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">childâ€™s wantsâ€”for food</ENAMEX>, stimulation, affection, and comfortâ€”are gratiï¬ed quickly. Such prompt satisfaction grants babies the security that their basic needs will be met. As a result, they do not have to be preoccupied with those needs and, instead, can turn their attention outward, toward acquiring physical, cognitive, and social skills. Warm, responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caregiving</ENAMEX> also promotes a view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> as kind and compassionateâ€”an outlook essential for motivating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to emulate and take direction from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1 and 2 years of age</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> begin to acquire language, greater understanding of the consequences of their actions, and the ability to comply with othersâ€™ requests and directives. Consequently, caregiversâ€™ expectations change. They increasingly insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> engage in socially appropriate conduct. During the very period in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must learn to subordinate their desires to social life, imaginative play ï¬‚ourishes. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX>, this synchrony between socialization and make-believe is no coincidence. Pretend play fortiï¬es childrenâ€™s capacity to use ideas to guide behavior. The young, immature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> runs after a ball that rolls into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, without considering consequences; drops toys on the spot when another activity engages her; and grabs an attractive object from a playmate, without regard for the playmateâ€™s rights and feelings. Make-believe play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> asserted, helps preschoolers conquer these impulses by granting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> repeated practice â€œin acting independently of what he sees.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€8</ENAMEX>
Just how does imaginative play help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> distinguish ideas from the enticing stimuli around them and use thought to guide behavior? According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX>, the object substitutions that permeate childrenâ€™s make-believe are crucial in this process. While pretending, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> continually use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> object to represent another. By making a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TinkerToy</ENAMEX> stand for a lollypop or a folded blanket stand for a sleeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> step back from reality. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TinkerToy</ENAMEX> becomes a means for separating the idea â€œlollipopâ€ from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a real lollipop</TIMEX>; the blanket becomes a means for separating the idea â€œbabyâ€ from a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>. This severing of thought from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and actions occurs because, in play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> change an objectâ€™s usual meaning. In calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TinkerToy</ENAMEX> a lollipop, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> conjured up the idea of a lollipop and used it to alter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TinkerToyâ</ENAMEX>€™s identity. As a result, rather than reacting impulsively to the sight of a lollipop, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> relied on ideas to regulate the lollipopâ€™s very existenceâ€”and the teddy bearâ€™s, the leprechaunâ€™s, and her own actions toward it!
At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ï¬rst</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> ï¬nd it difficult to distinguish words and other mental symbols from the objects and actions to which they refer. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> seem to realize this when, in the presence of their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>- or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year-old</TIMEX>, they phrase things this way to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult companion</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œAfter we ï¬nish running errands, letâ€™s stop off for some i-c<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-e c-r-e-a-m</ENAMEX>.â€ Ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> why they spell rather than say the words, and they remark, â€œIf you say â€˜ice <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX>,â€™ heâ€™ll want it now. He wonâ€™t be able to wait!â€
Childrenâ€™s earliest efforts at make-believe also reveal how challenging they ï¬nd the task of detaching thought from reality. Initially, object substitutions are closely tied to the real things they represent. Toddlers between ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1/2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> generally use only realistic-looking objects while pretendingâ€”a toy telephone to talk into or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a cup</NUMEX> to drink from<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> Once, I handed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-month-old</TIMEX> a small wooden block, put another to my ear, and called her on the phone: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œRing</ENAMEX>! Ring! <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynnay</ENAMEX>!â€ She responded by throwing down the block and turning to another activity. Yet when given a plastic replica of a push-button phone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynnay</ENAMEX> readily put the receiver to her ear and pretended to converse.
Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> begin to pretend with less realistic toys, such as a block for a telephone. And sometime during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third year</TIMEX>, they can imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and events with little or no support from the real world, as when they say to a play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, â€œIâ€™m calling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie</ENAMEX> on the phone!â€ while dialing with their hands or without acting out the event at all. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between ages 3 and 4</TIMEX>, this detachment of make-believe symbols from the real-life conditions they stand for is well developed. Letâ€™s look in on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX> as she draws her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> into a make-believe scenario. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice how Alisonâ</ENAMEX>€™s imagination ranges far beyond the immediate play props before herâ€”a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> set, a toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few moments</TIMEX>, she conjures up a fantastic, multicolored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and travels to a distant land where she <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> a cataclysmic event!

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>: (while stacking multicolored plastic spoons) I donâ€™t need my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> painted. It just got painted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>!
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: Just got painted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yep</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: What color was it painted?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>: Itâ€™s kind of, itâ€™s got brown and red in it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and red?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>: And a little peach color.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: A little peach color? What color is your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>: Well, itâ€™s yellow and orange and red.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: That sounds pretty.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>: All mixed together!
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: Oh, all mixed together.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>: Well, I have a dump <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>. Orâ€”what else would you like? An <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX>? (Picks up toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX> and hands it to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: Did someone get in an accident?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX>: Well, yes. (Then, referring to a newspaper report her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had mentioned earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, it said (changes to a low-pitched, somber tone of voice), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">â€œTwo trains crashingâ</ENAMEX>€”in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>.â€

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> maintained that in detaching symbols from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and actions, make-believe play helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> use thought to choose deliberately among alternative courses of behavior. In play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX> thinks about paint colors, which need not be the color of her real <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. She learns that you can consider possibilities and choose among them, thereby controlling eventual outcomes. 
Imaginative play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> noted, also functions as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> from the concrete thought of the preschool and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early school years</TIMEX> to mature â€œadult thought, which can be totally free of real situations.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â</ENAMEX>€10 In helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> disengage thought from reality, pretend play is vital preparation for the much later development of abstract thinking, in which symbols are manipulated and hypothetical ideas are evaluated without referring to currently existing, real world conditions.11 
When imagination eventually combines with the logical, abstract reasoning powers of adolescence, the stage is set for creativity. A truly creative work is both original and sensible; its novelty is culturally meaningful and useful. Almost always, creativity demands a high degree of self-regulationâ€”pulling together previously unrelated ideas, critically evaluating those ideas, and persevering in the face of obstacles<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX> In make-believe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX> experimented with the ï¬rst step of this multistep process when she melded news of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> with the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX> before her. As we will see shortly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> renowned for their creative accomplishments often report that make-believe play was a frequent, highly inï¬‚uential aspect of their early development.

Acquiring and Enacting the Rules of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Life</ENAMEX>

Had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> lived long enough to become familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erik Eriksonâ</ENAMEX>€™s psychoanalytic theory, he would have agreed that make-believe play teaches <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> about social roles and provides them with insights into what they can become in their society. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> was far more explicit about just how pretending helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> acquire dispositions that foster eager, willing participation in social life.
Childrenâ€™s imaginative play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> pointed out, contains an interesting paradox. In play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> seem to do what they most feel like doing, and to an outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>, their play appears free and spontaneous. Nevertheless, pretend play demands that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> act against their immediate impulses because they must subject themselves to the rules of the make-believe scene<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> pretending to go to sleep follows the rules of bedtime behavior. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> imagining herself to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and a doll to be a baby conforms to the rules of parental behavior. And a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronaut</ENAMEX> obeys the rules of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX> launch and space walk. 
In this sense, make-believe is not really â€œfree play,â€ as we often assume it to be. Instead, its very essence is self-restraintâ€”voluntarily following social rules. While pretending, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> explained, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> repeatedly face conï¬‚icts between the rules of the make-believe situation and what they would do if they could act impulsively, and they usually decide in favor of the rules. When tired, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sophieâ€™s teddy bear</ENAMEX> and leprechaun donâ€™t stay up late doing just as they please. Instead, they obey their caregivers and go to bed. With only one lollipop, or paciï¬er, to go around, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">teddy bear</ENAMEX> and leprechaun share. They donâ€™t quarrel and grab, and if they had done so, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> or another make-believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> probably would have intervened and insisted on kind, considerate behavior.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX>, childrenâ€™s greatest self-control occurs during make-believe play. They achieve their maximum display of willpower when at their own initiative they renounce a momentary attraction in favor of rule-governed behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.14</NUMEX> The paradox of make-believe is that in everyday life, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> subordinate actions to rules, they usually give up something they wantâ€”instead of keeping a treasured toy all to themselves, they share it; instead of continuing to play, they clean up; instead of watching more TV, they go to bed. During fantasy play, however, renouncing impulse and following social rules are central to the fun of playing. Rather than frustrating or disappointing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, self-restraint is the route to maximum pleasure. 
In sum, subordinating immediate desires to the rules of make-believe scenes becomes a new form of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">desire15â€”one</TIMEX> that responds to the childâ€™s need to become an accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of his or her culture. Indeed, if you watch preschoolers at play, you will see that they rarely violate the rules of their social world. And as they jointly create play scripts and follow social rules with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, they come to appreciate societyâ€™s norms and strive to uphold them. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> playing storekeeper experiences ï¬rsthand the reasons for having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> line up to pay, for making change accurately, and for being polite. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> playing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> in a household scene becomes aware of parental responsibilities and why itâ€™s important for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to follow their parentsâ€™ directives. 
In fact, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> who breaks a rule in make-believe usually brings <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">preschoolersâ</ENAMEX>€™ profound respect for social order into bold relief! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cara</ENAMEX>, a demanding but spirited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year-old</TIMEX>, likes to initiate make-believe with the following transparent role reversal: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œMom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iâ</ENAMEX>€™ll be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, and you be my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> 5 years old.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Caraâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> plays along for a while and then deliberately transgresses, refusing to eat her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> or pick up her toys. At the ï¬rst sign of misbehavior, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cara</ENAMEX> lectures in a tone of voice well beyond <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her years</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œChildren</ENAMEX> must obey their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> because their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> know things they donâ€™t, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> must take care of them.â€ As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caraâ</ENAMEX>€™s pronouncement makes clear, play creates a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> through which preschoolers internalize a basic sense of social responsibility and morality. At the same time, they acquire a wealth of practical knowledge and skills. 
In extreme circumstances, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and predictability of the real world fall apart, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> whose prior lives have been ï¬lled with parental warmth and involvement often call on rules and rituals in make-believe to restore their social world. Recently, I came across the recollections of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Cahana</ENAMEX>, an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX>, recounting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her days</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the death <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> explained that she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edith</ENAMEX> managed despite all odds to stay together. Their secret strategy was never to display any emotion that would give away their relationship, since a major objective of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS</ENAMEX> was to break up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Only at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> did they dare to hug, whisper, and play together. 
On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>, they marked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabbath</ENAMEX> in a special way, by imagining that they were at home. They talked about the eveningâ€™s events in minute detail to make the image of family life ï¬rm and real. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> had always had the responsibility of setting the table, and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> would correct her if she left out even small, nonessential items. In play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edith</ENAMEX> would murmur, â€œAlice, itâ€™s time to set the table. Find the nicest tablecloths, and donâ€™t forget the ï¬‚owers. Where are the napkins for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>? You forgot the fork for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>. You really shined the candelabra beautifully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, better than before.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> After their pretend <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> would whisper songs.
The rules of make-believe kept alive the integrity of the girlsâ€™ lost social world. They kindled hope, or as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX> put it, â€œan inner light,â€ fortifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with the self-restraint and forbearance they needed to endure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>. 
from make-believe play to organized games 
with rules

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> regarded the sociodramatic play of the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> as essential for further development of playâ€”speciï¬cally, for movement toward game play in middle childhood. In make-believe, the rules of play are implicit; preschoolers are hardly aware of enacting them. Instead, they are caught up in creating imaginary situationsâ€”putting a stuffed animal to bed, driving an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> crash, or ringing up a customerâ€™s purchase at the cash register. Winning and losing, team <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> and competition, and purposefully laying down rules are not of great interest to preschoolers. Try playing a rule-based game with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-old</TIMEX>, and you are likely to ï¬nd that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is easily sidetracked. If, with your prompting and guidance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> does ï¬nish the game, he or she might say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œI</ENAMEX> won!â€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â€œEverybody won</NUMEX>!â€ regardless of the outcome.
With age, the imaginativeness of play recedes. In the games that captivate school-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, rules come to the forefront<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17 Six- to 8</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-year-olds</TIMEX> are often preoccupied with working out the rules of a game and making sure all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> follow them. They often spend as much or more time on the details of how a game should proceed as they do playing the game itself! Nevertheless, every organized game with rules contains an imaginary situation in veiled form. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monopoly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are real estate moguls; in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>, they emulate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall-of-Fame</ENAMEX> idols. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> retain both aspects of play, in changing balances, throughout development.
Increasing emphasis on the rule-oriented side of play extends the â€œzoneâ€ forged by fantasy play during the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. By making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> more aware of the goals of their play activities, game play further strengthens childrenâ€™s capacity to overcome impulse. Consciously striving to reach a goal requires planningâ€”postponing action in favor of thinking out what to do in advance, organizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oneâ</ENAMEX>€™s behavior in accord with the plan, evaluating how well the plan is working along the way, and revising the plan if necessary. 
In the simple games of the late preschool and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early school years</TIMEX>, the play goal is very clearâ€”in hide-and-seek, to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œitâ€</ENAMEX> from ï¬nding you; in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chutes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ladders</ENAMEX>, to travel a road with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shortcuts</ENAMEX> and as few setbacks as possible, getting to the ï¬nish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line ï¬rst</ENAMEX>. Gradually, the goals of childrenâ€™s games become more distant and complex. Attaining those goals requires more intermediate steps and greater knowledge, skill, and coordination of play actions with those of othersâ€”in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>ball and kickball, scoring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> runs than the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> while adhering to fair procedures for batting, pitching, and ï¬elding; in chess, moving each type of piece according to its special rule in an effort to checkmate the opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. 
Through game play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> receive additional experience in setting goals, in regulating behavior in pursuit of those goals, and in subordinating behavior to rules. And in negotiating rules in peer-organized games, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> deepen their understanding of why rules are necessary and which ones work well. In the process, they form more mature concepts of fairness and justice. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> often remark that game play prepares <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for the inevitability of real downfalls and teaches perseverance and good sportsmanship.
In sum, the development of play proceeds from make-believe, with an overt imaginary situation and covert rules, to organized games, with overt rules and a covert imaginary situation. The vast yet nearly effortless learning that takes place through pretending makes it, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX>, â€œthe highest level of preschool development. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> moves forward essentially through play activity.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€18</ENAMEX> Make-believe play, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s theory, is the preeminent educational activity of early childhood.


contributions of make-believe play to development

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> emphasized the development-enhancing, forward-moving consequences of make-believe. Was he correct that pretending in early childhood has a far-reaching impact on development, supporting the emergence and reï¬nement of a wide variety of competencies? Indeed, much evidence ï¬ts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s conclusion. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sociodramatic</ENAMEX> play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> has been studied most thoroughly. Comparisons of preschoolersâ€™ sociodramatic activities with their social nonpretend pursuits, such as drawing pictures or putting puzzles together in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of agemates, supports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s view of make-believe as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> enhance their own development. In social pretending, preschoolers engage in lengthier interactions, are more involved, draw more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> into their activity, and are more cooperative. In view of these ï¬ndings, it is not surprising that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4- and 5-year-olds</TIMEX> who spend more time at sociodramatic play are advanced in intellectual development and are judged more socially competent by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">.19 Furthermore</ENAMEX>, pretend play fosters a diverse array of speciï¬c cognitive and social skills, which contribute to these broad-baseed outcomes. Letâ€™s take some examples.

Attention

Attention is fundamental to all human thinking. It determines the information considered in any task and whether the task will be completed. As any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> knows, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend only short times involved in most activities and are easily distracted. Yet attention becomes more sustained over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early childhoodâ</TIMEX>€”a development that equips <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for concentrated involvement, which will be essential for success once they enter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
Under what conditions are preschoolers most likely to display sustained attention? Think back to the examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophieâ€™s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattieâ</ENAMEX>€™s behavior at the beginning of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, and the answer will be clear: during play, especially complex play. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holly Ruff</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collaborators</ENAMEX> sat toddlers and preschoolers at a table of toys. Childrenâ€™s patterns of attention changed dramatically with age<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> After playing for a short time with a toy, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1- to 2-year-olds</TIMEX> dropped it and turned to another. Their attention was externally controlled by the physical properties of the objects. Hence, they ï¬‚itted from one toy to another and lost interest as the play session progressed. But once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> began to set goals in play, the nature of their attention changed. It became effortful, as indicated by eyes ï¬xed on the toys and a determined facial expression. 
For the youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, play goals were often as simple as getting a cap off a bottle. With age, the problems and challenges <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> set for themselves became more elaborate, such as building an intricate structure out of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> or acting out a fantasy scenario. The more complex childrenâ€™s play goals, the more they displayed focused, effortful attention and the more such attention increased over the play session. And in one of the studies, both construction and imaginative play were powerful predictors of sustained attention <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between ages 2</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.21</NUMEX> With respect to make-believe, when preschoolers create very intricate scenarios, either on their own or with play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, they generally stay absorbed for a very long time.
Recall the anecdote about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, who remained an attentive pupil considerably longer while playing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> than he did in other kindergarten activities. Preschoolersâ€™ sustained attention is more advanced in make-believe than in many real-life pursuits. When permitted to select freely among diverse activities at child care or preschool, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> overwhelmingly prefer fantasy play. Observing in a child-care center richly equipped with play materials, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Kirby</ENAMEX>, one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate students</ENAMEX>, found that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2- to 4-year-olds</TIMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of free-choice periods immersed in make-believeâ€”nearly twice as much time as they devoted to any other activity.22 The rapt attention engendered in pretend play may eventually carry over to nonpretend contexts.

Memory

Fantasy play also strengthens young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ</ENAMEX>€™s memories. Preschoolers remember information better in a play context than in a context in which information is isolated from its everyday use and they are told to remember deliberately. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Psychologist Lawrence Newman</ENAMEX> permitted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4- and 5-year-olds</TIMEX> to play with a set of toys and told another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> simply to remember the toys. Play produced far better recall<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX> During the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œrememberâ€ condition</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> repeatedly named and touched the objectsâ€”a rehearsal strategy that, much like repeating a phone number, helped them hold on to information, but only brieï¬‚y. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œplayâ€ condition</ENAMEX> led to many spontaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> of the toys that enabled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to recall effortlessly. Often these grew out of make-believeâ€”for example, putting the toy shoes on the doll and pretending to feed her the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX>. Narrating imaginative activities also yielded excellent recall, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œIâ</ENAMEX>€™m squeezing this lemonâ€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œFly away in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX>, doggie!â€ When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> embedded an object in meaningful make-believe, they increased its memorableness.
Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> acting out stories during pretend play are assisted in mastering the storytelling script, or basic framework of story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. Preschoolersâ€™ pretend scenarios are often quite storylike, consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, settings, and plot sequences that include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX>, suspense, surprise, conï¬‚ict, and resolution. Witness the following trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX>, during which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> save <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baby Shamu</ENAMEX> from danger:

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>: (to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily</ENAMEX>) Would you come with us? Letâ€™s go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX>.
E: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX>! Letâ€™s watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamu</ENAMEX>! Iâ€™m the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>. (All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> run to one end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and sit down next to one another. They gaze toward the other end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>: Oh! I see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamu</ENAMEX>.
E: Itâ€™s starting (presumably the show).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. J.</ENAMEX>: Yeah!
E: Thereâ€™s a little ï¬sh. Thereâ€™s a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>: Thereâ€™s a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy</ENAMEX>.
E: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Look</ENAMEX>! He fell on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>. Look at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€˜em.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mommy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Daddy</ENAMEX> are fell! Oh<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">-h-h-h</ENAMEX>!
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patting</ENAMEX> a pretend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby Shamu</ENAMEX>) Oh<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">-h-h-h</ENAMEX>! I know youâ€™re all right. (All make stroking motions on a pretend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baby Shamu</ENAMEX>.)
E: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Look</ENAMEX>! All better now. (She pretends to lift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby Shamu</ENAMEX> back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.) 24

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emily</ENAMEX>, who have formed a sense of story through make-believe, more readily grasp the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and meaning of new stories and are therefore more likely to remember them<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Young pretenders</ENAMEX> also impose the standards of story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> on the way they recall and explain their experiences to others. Their verbal narratives are more cohesive than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agemates</ENAMEX> who prefer other forms of play<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX> 
In helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> grasp the storytelling script (and in other ways we will take up next), make-believe play is wonderful preparation for literacy. Being able to anticipate story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> eases the task of making sense of written prose. It also grants <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> a ï¬rm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> for authoring their ï¬rst written narratives.

Language and Literacy

As the ï¬ndings just mentioned illustrate, make-believe greatly enriches childrenâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> with language. During sociodramatic activities, preschoolers hear speech that describes and comments on actions going on at the moment. This helps ensure that language is understandable because it is in tune with ongoing events. Consequently, when new words arise in the course of a fantasy scene, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can determine their meaning easily from cues in the situation. In this way, vocabulary extends during make-believe as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> introduce words they have heard during recent experiences. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œIâ€™m</ENAMEX> going out. I need my cloak,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizzy</ENAMEX>, mimicking an expression she had heard in a TV movie while grabbing a dress-up raincoat from a hook in the housekeeping area at child care. 
â€œYou mean your coat?â€ asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lizzieâ</ENAMEX>€™s playmate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œRight</ENAMEX>, a cloak is a coat,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Lizzie</ENAMEX> explained. The amount of time preschoolers spent talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> while pretending is positively associated with the size of their vocabularies at age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.27</NUMEX>
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> engage in play talk, they not only build their vocabularies but correct one anotherâ€™s errors, either directly or by demonstrating the acceptable way to speak. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance, a kindergartner enacting a telephone conversation said, â€œHello, come to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, please.â€ Her play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> quickly countered with appropriate telephone greeting behavior: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œNo, ï¬rst youâ€™ve</ENAMEX> got to say â€˜How are you? What are you doing?â€™â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">€28</NUMEX>
Furthermore, the language skills required to express different points of view, resolve disagreements, and persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> to collaborate so play can continue are complex and often subtle. Emilyâ€™s success in convincing several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> to join the make-believe trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX> was partly due to the way she approached themâ€”by asking if theyâ€™d like to go. By experimenting with language during play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can see how others react to various styles of communication and use that information to reï¬ne their way of speaking. In this way, play is an ideal arena for mastering all aspects of conversational dialogue.
Opportunities to acquire literacy-relevant skills also abound in make-believe play. In one kindergarten, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> transformed the block-building area into a make-believe recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with the help of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>. Signs were prepared that advertised the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, and what it would pay for various goods. As in other friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> wore nametags, such as â€œHi, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iâ€™m Charles!â</ENAMEX>€ When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> arrived with goods, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> had to ï¬ll out receipts listing each item, its quantity, and its value. Since many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> could not yet spell, they used ï¬rst letters or drew pictures of items. While doing so, they often became curious about how to write the full word and asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> to help them. 
What does research say about the role of make-believe in childrenâ€™s literacy development? The amount of time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> devote to pretending at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 4</TIMEX> is positively related to reading and writing skills after entering kindergarten and ï¬rst gradeâ€”speciï¬cally, the extent to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spontaneously read words on game cards and signs, understand print concepts, and write letters and simple words.29 The more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> engage in literacy-relevant play (activities like the recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>), the more advanced their literacy skills are as well. 
Preschoolersâ€™ commentary about language while pretending, using such verbs as say, talk, tell, write, and explain, is a particularly good predictor of reading progress at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 5</TIMEX>. Using language to talk about language happens often as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> jointly create fantasy scenes. Such talk may help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> treat both oral and written narratives as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> of analysis; hence its beneï¬ts for early reading<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX> 
With respect to writing, object substitutions and role play seem to have special beneï¬ts<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Frequently</ENAMEX> using objects to symbolize other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and transforming oneself into various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> may encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to try to make sense of other symbol systems, such as how to express themselves with print. In their ï¬rst efforts to write, preschoolers commonly assume that letters (just like pictures and ï¬rst substitute objects) look like their meanings. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> stated with certainty that the word deer begins with the letter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> is shaped like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>; then he demonstrated by drawing an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> and adding antlers to it!<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">32 Flexibly</ENAMEX> using make-believe symbols seems to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in revising early, incorrect ideas about how print is used to communicate.

Hypothetical Reasoning

During the preschool and elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, thought is largely tied to the here-and-now. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> think in an organized fashion about concrete information they can directly perceive but have great difficulty reasoning about hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">situationsâ€”ones</ENAMEX> that do not make sense in the real world. For example, try giving a child <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 4 and 9</NUMEX> the following problem: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Suppose dogs</ENAMEX> are bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> are bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Which one is the biggest: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>? Most will insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs couldnâ</ENAMEX>€™t possibly be bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œThatâ€™s</ENAMEX> never true!â€ they exclaim<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX>
Yet with the help of make-believe, even preschoolers can transcend these limits and reason about situations that defy real-world knowledge. Consider the following â€œimpossibleâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">premises</ENAMEX> and question: All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats bark</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rex</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>. Does <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rex bark</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Psychologists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Dias</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Harris</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4- to 6-year-olds</TIMEX> act out problems like this one, using toys that represented the content of the premises. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group was told that the events were taking place on a pretend planet rather than on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. And a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> merely listened and answered the questions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> â€œplayâ€ conditions gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> hypothetical responses and also justiï¬ed their answers with hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ideasâ</ENAMEX>€”for example, by saying â€œIn the story, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats bark</ENAMEX>, so we can pretend they bark.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€34</ENAMEX>
The capacity to adopt a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œtheoreticalâ€</ENAMEX> mode of reasoning in make-believe is highly consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s belief that pretending assists <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in separating mental symbols from the objects and actions for which they stand, thereby permitting them to manipulate meanings in innovative ways. Reasoning about the nonreal is essential for abstract thinking and for many creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endeavorsâ</ENAMEX>€”that is, for human cognition to reach its highest potential.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Distinguishing Appearance from Reality</ENAMEX>

After kissing their preschooler goodnight and turning out the lights, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are accustomed to hearing refrains like this: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œMommy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daddy</ENAMEX>, monsters are in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> again!â€ To rid the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> of scary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, pictures and mobiles may have to be removed and a thorough search conducted to assure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> that no monsters are lurking in the shadows, waiting to reappear as soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> leaves. Uncertainty about the relation between appearance and reality also surfaces in other situations. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3-year-old</TIMEX> who eagerly dons her costume may become frightened at the sight of her animal- or witch-like appearance in the mirror. And a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> who shaves off his beard and mustache may ï¬nd that his young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschooler</ENAMEX> reacts with puzzlement and distress to his changed appearance.
Consistent with these all-too-familiar experiences, research conï¬rms that preschoolers are easily tricked by the outward appearance of things. They mistakenly conclude that the way things look or sound is the way they really are. In several studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Flavell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Green</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor Flavell</ENAMEX> presented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with appearanceâ€“reality problems in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> were disguised in various ways. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were asked what the objects were, â€œreally and truly.â€ Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 6</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> took things at face value.35 When asked whether a white piece of paper placed behind a blue ï¬lter is â€œreally and trulyâ€ blue or whether a can that sounds like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> crying when turned over is â€œreally and truly a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>,â€ they responded, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œYes!â€</ENAMEX> 
Yet in make-believe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> use objects to symbolize things that are very different from the objects themselvesâ€”a ball to stand for an apple, a laundry basket for a cradle. They do not judge these imaginary symbols to be real, so clearly they can tell the difference between pretend and real experiences long before they can answer many appearanceâ€“reality problems correctly<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.36</NUMEX> The more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3- to 5-year-olds</TIMEX> spontaneously engage in joint make-believe with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> at preschool, the better they can distinguish the apparent and real identities of disguised objects<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pretending</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> may help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> master appearanceâ€“ reality distinctions because it offers repeated practice in transforming a wide variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> from their real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to a pretend state and back again.

Understanding the Mind and Its Many Activities

Make-believe play provides a rich foundation for childrenâ€™s comprehension of the mindâ€™s wide-ranging capabilities. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 3</ENAMEX>, I noted that childrenâ€™s elaborate interactions with imaginary companions foster understanding of false belief and other peopleâ€™s perspectives. In sociodramatic play as well, opportunities to act out and coordinate various roles probably help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> grasp similarities and differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in desires, beliefs, and feelings. Recently, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> recounted to me a make-believe episode initiated by her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 1/2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Traci</ENAMEX>, involving extended experimentation with and reversals of roles, which led to abundant dialogue about mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. 
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">One evening</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Traci</ENAMEX>, her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> had gathered in the living room to watch a video of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sound of Music</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traci</ENAMEX> showed little interest in the movie, her ears perked up at a statement in the sound track reporting the death of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trapp</ENAMEX>-family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traci</ENAMEX> began to ask questions, to talk about how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> must have gotten sick and gone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, and to repeat that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had died. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next hour and a half</TIMEX>, she assigned her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and herself <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least ï¬fteen</NUMEX> different rolesâ€”mother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>, and moreâ€”as she explored the idea of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> dying: 

Traci: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œHere</ENAMEX>, youâ€™re the baby and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iâ</ENAMEX>€™m the mama. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Honey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iâ</ENAMEX>€™m going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>.â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mother: â</ENAMEX>€œGo to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> help you feel better.â€
Traci: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œNo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iâ</ENAMEX>€™m not going to feel better. Iâ€™m going to die!â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>: (frantically) â€œNo, no, I donâ€™t want you to die! Iâ€™ll be very, very sad.â€
Traci: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œOK</ENAMEX>, donâ€™t worry, itâ€™ll be all right.â€

Some scenarios (like this one) ended happily; others were ï¬lled with depressing events and ended sadly. In acting them out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traci</ENAMEX> imagined and simulated diverse wants, hopes, worries, and strivings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in her life. 
As this brief vignette illustrates, sociodramatic play is rich in mental-state language, especially references to emotion. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learn about mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> from conversing and engaging in make-believe with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, they transfer this knowledge to sociodramatic play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more 3- and 4-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> talk about mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> during joint make-believe, the better they perform and the more they improve over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX> on tasks assessing their grasp of mental life<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38</NUMEX> These include understanding of false belief, identifying the feelings of a puppet acting out emotionally charged situations (such as seeing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> off on a trip), and explaining real-life causes of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and mixed emotions (for example, why one might feel both happy and sad about winning a race against a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>). 
Talk between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> that focuses on feelings seems to play a particularly strong role in the diversity of themes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> act out in their joint make-believe. Complexity of play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, in turn, is a good indicator of preschoolersâ€™ understanding of other peopleâ€™s feelingsâ€”more so than is their play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>.39 Why might conversing and pretending with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> make a special contribution to childrenâ€™s capacity to read othersâ€™ emotions? In interacting with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> spend much time acknowledging and clarifying the childâ€™s feelings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siblings</ENAMEX> (as well as preschool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>) frequently articulate how they themselves feel. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> more often expose the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of someone other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> himself or herself. The more affectionate and cooperative siblingsâ€™ relationships are, the more sophisticated their sociodramatic play<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Siblings</ENAMEX> who get along well are probably better at creating and sustaining elaborate make-believe scenariosâ€”play that contributes to their emotional sensitivity. 
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> build on each otherâ€™s play themes, they often refer to their make-believe with mental terms by making statements like these: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œLetâ€™s pretend,â€ â€œLetâ€™s imagine,â€ â</ENAMEX>€œYou act like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Iâ€™ll</ENAMEX> make-believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iâ</ENAMEX>€™m in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>.â€ Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> believe that this suspension of play to communicate about it marks a major change in understanding<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.41</NUMEX> Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do not just represent experiences in play; they display awareness that make-believe is an activity in which the mind creates events. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> become capable of consciously reï¬‚ecting on and deliberately manipulating their own and othersâ€™ fanciful representations, and their play becomes even more complex and imaginative.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Researchers</ENAMEX> continue to debate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">preschoolers</ENAMEX> actually view pretending as a mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> rather than just a series of actions mirroring real life.42 But there is clear evidence that their grasp of make-believe as a mental activity improves steadily <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between ages 4 and 8</TIMEX>. Over time, they can answer more subtle questions about the nature of make-believe. For example, by age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> most realize that pretending depends on having prior knowledge about a make-believe role. That is, a person hopping can be pretending to be a rabbit only if he or she knows that rabbits hop<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 6 and older</TIMEX> also recognize that make-believe is something you can do just inside your head, without using your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> at all<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX>
Why is this understanding of make-believe as mental representation so important? When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> master this and other related ideasâ€”that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are constantly engaged in thought, even when they have nothing to do; that mental inferences, not just direct observations, can lead to new knowledge; and that prior experiences affect peopleâ€™s interpretations of new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">experiences45â€”they</TIMEX> show that they have begun to pay more attention to the processes of thought<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">.46 â€œThinking about thoughtâ</NUMEX>€ makes possible a major advance in self-regulation. It permits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to call on what they know about mental life to surmount cognitive and social challenges. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> well aware of the mindâ€™s active, transforming capabilities is more likely to attend to relevant information, to plan, to use memory and problem-solving strategies, and to evaluate and revise his or her thinking to make it more effective. In sum, make-believe in early childhood is among those factors that promote reï¬‚ective thought, which improves throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the school years</TIMEX>.

Self-Regulation

As we have just seen, pretend play, through its impact on childrenâ€™s awareness of the mind, fosters advanced forms of self-regulation. But what about the self-regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">capacities</ENAMEX> that emerge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, during the preschool yearsâ€”self-guiding private speech, willingness to take on chores, and capacity to delay gratiï¬cation for brief periods? Does make-believe foster these early indicators of a self-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>? Findings of several studies I carried out with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate students</ENAMEX> suggest that it does.

private speech.â€‚â€‚In the ï¬rst of these studies, we reasoned that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> is correct that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learn to overcome impulse and manage their behavior through pretend play, then private speech should be especially frequent within make-believe activities. To ï¬nd out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry Krafft</ENAMEX> and I observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3- to 5-year-olds</TIMEX> during free-choice periods in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contexts differing sharply in encouragement of imaginative play: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y Preschool</ENAMEX> (called this because it is sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YWCA</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montessori Preschool</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.47</NUMEX> 
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y Preschool</ENAMEX>, play formed the basis of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> program. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> had easy access to a wide variety of toys, games, and books, and each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> especially conducive to sociodramatic play: a block-building area with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> blocks varying in size and shape and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-sized playhouse brimming with all manner of housekeeping props. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montessori Preschool</ENAMEX>, in contrast, actively discouraged make-believe (although not all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montessori</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> do so). Spurred by philosophical principles advocating realistic activities, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Montessori</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œwork stationsâ€</ENAMEX> from which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> selected. Typical options were puzzles, picture-matching and picture-sequencing tasks, letter tracing, small construction blocks, containers with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for pouring, books, and crayons and other tools for drawing and writing. When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Montessori</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> strayed into make-believe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> often interrupted, drawing them back to work-station pursuits. 
Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Montessori</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> did engage in pretending, but it was sharply restricted relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y Preschool</ENAMEX>, who displayed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as much imaginative play. What happened to private speech? It showed a parallel trend. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y Preschool</ENAMEX> engaged in twice as much self-talk as did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montessori</ENAMEX> preschool. Furthermore, pretend play emerged as the strongest correlate of both fantasy-play private speech and self-guiding private speech. That is, the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> engaged in make-believe, the more they talked to themselves to work out pretend charactersâ€™ actions and to guide their thought and behavior during realistic tasks. This latter ï¬nding suggests that private speech, so rich in the make-believe context, may carry over to childrenâ€™s self-talk when they face real-world challenges.
Recall from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 3</ENAMEX> that as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> master puzzles and other problem-solving tasks, their self-guiding speech declines. Yet when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Gillingham</ENAMEX> and I observed preschoolers in a laboratory playroom liberally equipped with fantasy-play props, we found that private speech during make-believe remained uniformly high from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 2 to 4</TIMEX> and actually increased at age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.48</NUMEX> Our interpretation of the prevalence of private speech during make-believe is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> continually set challenges for themselves in fantasy play. Consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s theory, they create their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzones</ENAMEX>,â€ frequently calling on self-directed language to work out their imaginings and bring behavior under the control of thought.
socially responsible behavior.â€‚â€‚In yet another study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Elias</ENAMEX> and I addressed the question of whether complex make-believeâ€” speciï¬cally, sociodramatic play involving elaborate communication between agematesâ€”promotes socially responsible behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.49</NUMEX> During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of the school year</TIMEX>, we observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3- and 4-year-olds</TIMEX> as they played in the block and housekeeping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of their preschools and rated the quantity and maturity of their fantasy endeavors. Then we assessed social responsibility by observing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> during clean-up periods, recording the extent to which they willingly picked up and put away toys without prompting and assistance. We made these clean-up observations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> so we could measure gain in responsible behavior. 
Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ï¬ndings</ENAMEX> revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> who more often engaged in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> sociodramatic play showed greater improvement in social responsibility over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 5 to 6 months</TIMEX>. And this relationship was particularly strong for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> rated by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> as highly impulsiveâ€”that is, who were poorly self-regulated to begin with! In other words, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> most in need of enhancing their self-regulatory abilities appeared especially sensitive to the beneï¬ts of sociodramatic play.

Imagination and Creativity

In addition to its contribution to many nonplay skills, make-believe can be examined on its own terms: as an imaginative activity that expresses salient aspects of the childâ€™s inner cognitive and emotional life. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s theory, the drive to fantasize and engage in role play does not fade away with childhood. Instead, he maintained, the imagination of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX> is an internalized, condensed form of early childhood make-believe that can be considered play without action. We typically experience it as an elaborate stream of consciousness made up of mental images and silent self-talk that meanders along, remarking on new experiences, reï¬‚ecting on the past, and predicting the future<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.50</NUMEX>
By introducing fantasy elements into consciousness, this inventive private commentary probably helps us cope with the mundane, repetitive aspects of our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> lives. We resort to such ruminations while waiting; during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long</TIMEX> car trips or meetings; and at other monotonous or idle times. In this way, early make-believe fortiï¬es us with a mental tool that is vital for adapting to everyday life! And from time to time, we apply logical, adaptive thinking to this inner playfulness to harness it for culturally worthwhile purposes. The result may be a creative idea or product.
Was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> correct that the imaginative mental combinations that form the basis for creativity originate in the pretend scenarios of early childhood? Unfortunately, we have no long-term studies that systematically observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for the imaginativeness of their play and then tracked them to document their creative accomplishments in adulthood. And even if such studies were available, many intervening events could blur the connection between early play and adult creativity. At present, all we have available to explore this relationship are the recollections of highly creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> about their childhoods or the reports of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographers</ENAMEX>.
On a recent visit to my local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, I browsed the shelves devoted to biography, selecting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several dozen</NUMEX> life stories of accomplished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>. The accounts were remarkably consistent: For most, pretend play was an inï¬‚uential aspect of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early years</TIMEX>. Often a signiï¬cant personâ€”a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, an older sibling, or a relativeâ€”promoted imaginative experimentation and a sense of wonder by telling fantastic stories, initiating joint pretend, or offering gifts (such as books and puppets) that inspired make-believe<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.51</NUMEX> 
For example, biographical accounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Curie</ENAMEX>, co-discoverer of radium and twice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX>, invariably make reference to her fatherâ€™s untiring efforts to provide his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with ideas and games to ï¬ll their spare time<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.52</NUMEX> A chest of colored blocks had special meaning. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie</ENAMEX> and her older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> to represent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, mountains, rivers, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, and continents. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, a high school science <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, often joined in, capitalizing on play as a way to teach geography. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Curie</ENAMEX> grew up, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biographer</ENAMEX> summed up, â€œplay was learning and learning was play.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€53</ENAMEX>
In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sylvia Plathâ</ENAMEX>€™s childhood, stories and storytelling were pervasive. As a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 1/2-year-old</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sylvia</ENAMEX> was intensely jealous of her sickly younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> for consuming so much of her motherâ€™s attention. While the baby nursed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sylvia</ENAMEX> sat nearby on the ï¬‚oor, impatient and unhappy. Her mother discovered that she could defuse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sylviaâ</ENAMEX>€™s envy with a game in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sylvia</ENAMEX> spread out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> before her, picked out all the capital letters on the page, and pretended, in a very grown-up way, to readâ€”an achievement that attracted much parental admiration. Sylviaâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> often made up bedtime tales, serialized from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one evening</TIMEX> to the next. Almost as soon as they could talk, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sylvia</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> responded in kind with limericks, poems, and fantastic stories of their own. On walks to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">grandparentsâ€™ house</ENAMEX> and on long car trips, favorite books invariably came along, offering ready inspiration for the childrenâ€™s imaginative creations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.54</NUMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Filmstar Charlie Chaplinâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was herself a talented comedy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>. As a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> often accompanied her when she went to work at the theater. As a result, playacting and impersonating became an early focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Charlieâ€™s</ENAMEX> pretending. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">One evening</TIMEX> during a performance, his motherâ€™s voice failed. In a pinch, the stage manager, who had seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> at play, led the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> onstage in her place. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> continued his playacting unabated, which included songs, dances, and impersonations from his motherâ€™s repertoire. He was demonstrating the wares of his ï¬rst and best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> in the art of make-believe, and the performance evoked a roar of appreciation and a shower of coins from the crowd<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.55</NUMEX>
In these and many other similar biographical anecdotes, childhood make-believe engendered imaginativeness that was clearly related to outstanding accomplishment in adulthood. Of course, the scientiï¬c and artistic talents of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curie, Plath</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX> are rare among us. Nevertheless, as play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Singer</ENAMEX> point out, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have â€œthat same potential for playfulness, for trying out possible lives, that is the foundation for a humbler but personally meaningful creativity.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€56</ENAMEX>


adult involvement in childrenâ€™s make-believe

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piagetâ€™s</ENAMEX> view of make-believe play, dominant until recently, asserts that pretending emerges spontaneously when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> become capable of symbolic thought. He assumed that very young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> could not share play symbols with others. Yet in instance after instance, we have seen that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are central in preschoolersâ€™ play lives, often encouraging and elaborating on their imaginative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strivings</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are prominent in early make-believe, how did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> manage to adhere to an image of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fantasizers</ENAMEX> for so long? The reason is that until recently, make-believe was largely studied in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, in sessions in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> arrived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at</NUMEX>-a-time and had no alternative but to play by themselves. 
Only during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</TIMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> seriously addressed the social context of make-believe. Their ï¬ndings conï¬rm that pretending, like other higher forms of thinking, ï¬‚ows from social collaboration. More competent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> scaffold young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ</ENAMEX>€™s imaginative play, guiding its emergence and gradual reï¬nement. Once pretend capacities are in place, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> forge playful understandings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> that serve as microcosms of cooperative activity, mirroring social relations and goal-oriented pursuits within the larger society.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scaffolding Childrenâ</ENAMEX>€™s Play

Traci, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 -year-old</TIMEX> who responded so strongly to the motherâ€™s death in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Sound of Music</ENAMEX>, often pretends with her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some weeks</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traci</ENAMEX> had been talking about a mysterious creature she called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œmaserus</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Traciâ</ENAMEX>€™s description of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> convinced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX> that the maserus was an imaginative friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX>. Congested due to spring <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traci</ENAMEX> was particularly irritable <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</TIMEX>. Well aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traci</ENAMEX> loves make-believe activities, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> tried to distract her with a favorite pastime. 
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traci</ENAMEX> sneezed and whimpered, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX> spied a half-full white garbage bag in a corner, situated in such a way that it looked like an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> with a snout. â€œI think I see a maserus!â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX> declared, pointing to the garbage bag. Immediately <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traci</ENAMEX> cast off her irritability and jumped into action. Over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next hour</TIMEX>, she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> fed the maserus more trash, read books and sang songs to it, and laughed at the monsterâ€™s antics. â€œBy the end of our delightful session,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Julie</ENAMEX> remarked, â€œI almost felt the bag was alive.â€ When the activity changed to the more practical concerns of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traciâ</ENAMEX>€™s problematic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">irritability</ENAMEX> resumed.
Recent research reveals that make-believe is, from the outset, a social activity.57 In Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, it usually ï¬rst appears between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, although older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> may participate as well. From these interactions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> derive many play skills that enhance their make-believe in other contexts. 
In one of the most extensive studies tracing the development of make-believe play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy Haight</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peggy Miller</ENAMEX> followed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 4 years of age</TIMEX>, repeatedly visiting their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to make intensive observations of their pretending<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.58</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> found that most make-believeâ<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">€”from 68 to 75 percentâ</NUMEX>€”was social across the entire age <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> were the childrenâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 1 to 3</TIMEX>. Over time, motherâ€“child play declined and childâ€“child play increased. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> played about equally with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and with other childrenâ€”both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. 
The dominance of motherâ€“child pretend at the youngest ages, however, was not due to lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child playmates</ENAMEX>. Up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3</TIMEX>, even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> were present, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> preferred playing with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haight</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>, as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, report clear evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> teach their toddlers to pretend. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> initiate almost all make-believe episodes. They also demonstrate many pretend actions toward objects, thereby showing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> how to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> object to represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another.59</NUMEX> Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> begin to talk about nonexistent fantasy objects. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> suggested that an empty bowl was full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juicy oranges</ENAMEX>, one for each of her sonâ€™s miniature zoo <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. This change may help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> increase the range and complexity of their play symbols<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.60</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Functions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Consequences of Adultâ€“Child Play</ENAMEX>

Joint adultâ€“child make-believe serves a wide variety of social purposes. Here is a sampling: 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€¢Teaching.</ENAMEX> At times, caregivers use pretending as a pleasurable way to teach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> real-world skills. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michaelâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> capitalized on make-believe to encourage her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year-old</TIMEX> to use the toilet. Reluctant at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ï¬rst</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> became an eager learner after being put in charge of toilet training his teddy bear<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.61</NUMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€¢Enlivening</ENAMEX> daily routines. Often <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and their caregivers call on pretend play to relieve the monotony of chores and other repetitive tasks. While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX> folded socks with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, she put a pair together, held it up, and exclaimed, â€œMommy, I made us something to eat!â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">€62</NUMEX>
â€¢Defusing conflict. Occasionally, make-believe can defuse persistent caregiverâ€“child conï¬‚icts. Concerned about 3-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nancyâ</ENAMEX>€™s use of a paciï¬er, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had been trying to get her to give it up. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> resisted. As they played with puppets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> announced, â€œI want a paciï¬er!â€ Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motherâ</ENAMEX>€™s puppet responded, â€œLittle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>. You have only a red dot for a mouth. I donâ€™t think you can ï¬t a paciï¬er in there!â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">€63</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢Expressing</ENAMEX> and regulating emotion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traciâ€™s</ENAMEX> exploration, with her motherâ€™s help, of what it might be like to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> who got sick and died exempliï¬es how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> use make-believe to express and manage intense feelings. In pretend scenarios, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traci</ENAMEX> acted out feeling ill, feeling better, sadness, happiness, worry, love, and caring.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢Inï¬‚uencing</ENAMEX> anotherâ€™s social behavior. Joint make-believe can be an effective strategy for attaining a social goal. When <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX> stood at the top of a slide and asked for help, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> tried to get her to slide down on her own. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX> refused and stepped into pretend: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œA shark</ENAMEX> . . . Thereâ€™s a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand!â€ Mollyâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> immediately helped her down<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.64</NUMEX>
â€¢Having fun. As illustrations of adultâ€“child make-believe throughout this chapter affirm, most of the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> engage in imaginative play just for fun. In fact, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> have argued that the earliest expressions of humor emerge out of fantasy play<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.65</NUMEX> Consistent with this claim, participating in adultâ€“child make-believe seems to precede childrenâ€™s ï¬rst verbal jokes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ari</ENAMEX>, having become an avid make-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believer</ENAMEX>, soon showed a corresponding rise in joking. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">At 20 months</TIMEX>, he touched a picture of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> in a book his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was reading to him, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">exclaimed â€œNeigh!â€</ENAMEX> and laughed hysterically. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">At 21 months</TIMEX>, while watching his mother wash dishes, he remarked, â€œNutmeg [the family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks water</ENAMEX> with spoonâ€ and then interpreted, â€œFunny thing! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ari</ENAMEX> tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mommy</ENAMEX> joke.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€66 As Ariâ</ENAMEX>€™s humor makes plain, pretending is not just a pleasurable activity in itself but brings pleasure to life in general.

That joint make-believe with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> is such great fun is undoubtedly a major reason that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1- to 3-year-olds</TIMEX> are so attracted to it. But why is play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, at least initially, more engaging than play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>? While childrenâ€™s play skills are still limited, adult scaffolding makes play more interesting, surprising, and absorbing. In several studies, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1- to 3-year-olds</TIMEX> engaged in more than twice as much make-believe when their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were involved than when they were not. In addition, caregiver support led early make-believe to move toward a more advanced level<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.67</NUMEX> For example, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> actively took part, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> produced more complex pretend <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequencesï¿½ï¿½not</ENAMEX> just putting the doll to sleep but brushing her teeth, tucking her into bed, singing a lullaby, and kissing her good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. Furthermore, during parentâ€“child play, make-believe themes are more varied, and parentsâ€™ verbal commentary is especially effective in raising both the duration and the complexity of play. 
In line with the â€œzone,â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for whom make-believe is just emerging act more competently when playing with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult partner</ENAMEX> than they otherwise would. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haight</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millerâ€™s</ENAMEX> investigation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-year-olds</TIMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> engaged in a great deal of pretending ranked especially high in peer play at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 4</TIMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the most imaginative and enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were among the most highly skilled preschool pretenders.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vital Features of Adultâ€“Child Play</ENAMEX>

How should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, caregivers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> go about engaging young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in make-believe? Effective scaffolding of play is somewhat different from scaffolding of nonplay tasks. In fostering play, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> might have explicit goals, such as teaching culturally valued knowledge and skills and promoting self-regulation and imagination. But directiveness and didactic teaching are seldom, if ever, necessary. 
As play <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Sutton-Smith</ENAMEX> pointed out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a quarter-century ago</TIMEX>, make-believe enables <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who are still acquiring language to represent their everyday lives and inner thoughts and feelings more completely than is possible through any other symbolic means. This conï¬rms <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotskyâ€™s</ENAMEX> statement that â€œin play, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> always behaves beyond his average age, above his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> behavior.â€ Look back at the vignettes described in this chapterâ€”of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sophie</ENAMEX> giving a sleepy teddy bear a paciï¬er, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alison</ENAMEX> recalling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily</ENAMEX> traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX>, and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traci</ENAMEX> role-playing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> getting sick and dyingâ€”and note how difficult it would be for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2- to 4-year-olds</TIMEX> to construct such well-articulated ideas only in words or in their drawings. Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> do not need to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œtutorâ€ preschoolers</ENAMEX> in pretending, as they sometimes do when helping them master puzzles or other similar tasks.
Instead, adult participation in make-believe works best when it responds to, guides, and builds on the childâ€™s behaviors with demonstrations and suggestions. In support of this approach, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Fieseâ</ENAMEX>€™s observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> playing with their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15- to 24-month-olds</TIMEX> revealed that maternal questions, directions, and intrusions (initiating a new activity unrelated to the childâ€™s current play) led to immature behavior in which toddlers merely mouthed, touched, and looked at toys. Relentlessly barraging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with information that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">communicates â€œatâ€</ENAMEX> rather than â€œwithâ€ them fails to involve them in dialogue and interferes with optimum development of play. In contrast, turn-taking and joint involvement, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> sustained or expanded on their childâ€™s play themes, evoked high levels of pretending<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.68</NUMEX> 
Maternal interactions that suggest play options related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1/2</NUMEX>-year-oldsâ€™ ongoing activityâ€”for example, saying â€œOh, is the doll trying to swim?â€ as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> puts a doll into a toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cupâ</ENAMEX>€”continue to predict extended make-believe sequences and imaginative object substitutions at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3</TIMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddlers</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> negate and correctâ€”â€œNo, dolls donâ€™t go in cups, they go in the doll houseâ€â€”tend to become <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-year-olds</TIMEX> who spend much time in simple, immature manipulation of toys<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.69</NUMEX> 
Finally, the shared understanding underlying any type of adultâ€“child communication that creates the â€œzoneâ€ is also essential in make-believe. Sensitive and mutually rewarding interaction between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ï¬rst year</TIMEX> of life predicts complexity of motherâ€“child pretending and childrenâ€™s use of mental-state words during play at age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.70</NUMEX> Parental behaviors that assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œconnectingâ</ENAMEX>€ socially and becoming effective conversationalists seem to enhance their play competence and ability to talk about othersâ€™ thoughts and feelings later on. In sum, quality of adultâ€“child social engagement, both within and outside of make-believe play, has much to do with the potential of such play to lead childrenâ€™s development forward.
enhancing sociodramatic play with peers

At child care, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX> joins a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the block area for a space shuttle launch. â€œThat can be our control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>,â€ he suggests to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>, pointing to a corner by a bookshelf.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWait</ENAMEX>, I gotta get it ready,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> calls out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynette</ENAMEX>, who is still arranging the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronauts</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dolls and a bear) inside a circle of large blocks, which represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rocket</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œOK</ENAMEX>, all aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery!â€ Sammy</ENAMEX> broadcasts into a small wooden block, his pretend loudspeaker. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynette</ENAMEX> sets up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronauts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX> announces, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œCountdown!â€</ENAMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œFive</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four one</NUMEX>, blastoff!â€ responds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynette</ENAMEX> makes one of the dolls push a pretend button and reports, â€œBrrrm, brrrm, theyâ€™re going up<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">!â</NUMEX>€
Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who have regular contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, sociodramatic play with agemates increases greatly between ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 5.71</NUMEX> As this excerpt reveals, by age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can create and coordinate several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in an elaborate plot and weave together intricate role relationships and story linesâ€”factors that, as we have seen, contribute greatly to their cognitive and social competence.
Pretending with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> draws on the diverse communication skills <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> develop with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. A secure infantâ€“parent attachment bond, which grows out of caregiver warmth, responsiveness, and sensitive communication, predicts socially mature peer play in early childhood, including cooperation, empathy, and popularity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.72</NUMEX> And as I indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>, the blend of warmth and expectations for mature behavior that make up authoritative parenting is linked to skilled peer interaction as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> play with agemates must be responsive and harmonious to result in pleasurable, satisfying, long-lasting play. 
If sociodramatic play with agemates is to serve as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> for learning, shared understanding, or intersubjectivity, is essential, just as it is in adultâ€“ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> dialogues. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttle</ENAMEX>-launch episode, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynette</ENAMEX> reached a high level of intersubjectivity as they worked out a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of labor and responded to one another in a smooth, complementary fashion. Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do argue and disagree. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> underscored the role of these conï¬‚icts in getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to give up their egocentrism and notice othersâ€™ perspectives<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.73</NUMEX> Yet conï¬‚ict is far less effective in promoting sensitivity to othersâ€™ beliefs, thoughts, and feelings than is returning to a state of intersubjectivityâ€”by engaging in cooperative dialogues and resolving differences of opinion<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.74</NUMEX>
Intersubjectivity among preschool play <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> increases with age. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artin GÃ¶ncÃ¼</ENAMEX> observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3- and 4-year-olds</TIMEX> engaged in sociodramatic pursuits, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-olds</TIMEX> more often considered their partnersâ€™ preferences and built on their partnersâ€™ play actsâ€”by asking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> what he or she would like to do, introducing relevant new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> into the play narrative, compromising in instances of conï¬‚ict, and expressing agreement with the partnerâ€™s ideas. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> These features of play reï¬‚ect childrenâ€™s developing sensitivity to diverse points of view and their appreciation of the value of a meeting of minds for pleasurable, rewarding play.
Research indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> rarely mediate preschoolersâ€™ peer relations unless intense disagreements arise that threaten safety or (in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> order<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.76</NUMEX> And when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> do step in, they seldom use interventions that help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> regulate their own interaction. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> often resort to directive strategies, in which they tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> exactly what to say and do and therefore solve the problem for them, as in, â€œDonâ€™t grab. Ask for a turn!â€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œWait until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra</ENAMEX> is ï¬nished.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€77</ENAMEX>
These techniques are appropriate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who lack social skills and therefore, at least initially, beneï¬t from clear direction. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> need to modify these strategies to suit childrenâ€™s play maturity, providing assistance tailored to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">childâ€™s â€œzone</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Sticking</ENAMEX> with directive interventions does not prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to come up with effective solutions to conï¬‚ict as it arisesâ€”strategies that work because they take into account both the childâ€™s and the playmateâ€™s desires.
At times, the adult might model a social skill or give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> examples of strategies, as in, â€œYou could ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX>, â€˜Would you let me try it for a while?â€™ or you could say, â€˜May we share it?â€™â€ At other times, the adult might encourage the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to generate possible strategies: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œWhat could you do to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea</ENAMEX> to let you play, too?â€ In each instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> select the level of support that best matches the childâ€™s current social capacities and then pull back as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> acquires new social problem-solving skills. 
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> hesitate to mediate childrenâ€™s play, perhaps because they believe (incorrectly) that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> pick up social skills just by spending time with agemates. Vygotskyâ€™s theory tells us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in childrenâ€™s social development. If they wait until a childâ€™s negative acts become extreme, then their ï¬rst impulse is to assert high control, and sometimes force. The following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> suggestions can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> select strategies that foster more mature social behavior:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢Intervene</ENAMEX> soon enough to prevent peer difficulties from escalating, thereby avoiding highly intrusive intervention tactics.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢Focus</ENAMEX> on developing the skills of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, not just on quelling disturbances. Ask yourself, â€œWhat have I seen this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> do in situations similar to this one? How can I help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> communicate more effectively?â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢Think</ENAMEX> in terms of the support that is necessary without taking over social responsibilities that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can assume on their own. Ask yourself, â€œHow much of my help does the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> require to meet his or her goals in this situation? A general prompt? Some suggested strategies? Or a speciï¬c directive and a demonstration?â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">€78</NUMEX>

Compared to sociodramatic play, preschoolers ï¬nd it harder to establish a cooperative, shared framework when working together on realistic projects, such as construction, puzzle, and art activities.79 To collaborate on these tasks, they need much more adult instruction and monitoring than they do in make-believe activities. Here, again, childrenâ€™s social competence is more advanced in make-believe play than in other situations. The social skills mastered in sociodramatic activities gradually generalize, helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> work toward shared goals in nonplay pursuits.


physical contexts for make-believe play

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> promote childrenâ€™s make-believe not just through scaffolding their pretending and social behavior but also through arranging a stimulating, appropriate play environment. The physical context of childrenâ€™s play is important because it shapes play themes and opportunities to interact with agemates. Consequently, it can have a profound impact on what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learn.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Play Materials</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys</ENAMEX> and other play props should capitalize on childrenâ€™s current make-believe capacities while gently spurring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> forward, toward a wider range of themes, roles, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and increasingly intricate story lines. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> become conscious of the goals of play and more concerned with rules and rule-following, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> can provide opportunities for game play. Then they can extend these understandings by gradually introducing more complex games.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Bronsonâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Right Stuff for Children Birth to Age 880</ENAMEX> is an excellent resource for selecting play materials that support development in early childhood. Although it is written for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, preschool and child-care center <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX>, and elementary school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>, it can also guide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Here is an overview of changing needs for make-believe and game materials from toddlerhood into the primary grades.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beginnings</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 months to 2 years</TIMEX>.â€‚â€‚Toddlers need a small selection of realistic-looking toys to support their beginning capacity to pretend. These include stuffed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>; soft, cloth-bodied or rubber dolls with simple care accessories; a play telephone and housekeeping items to support role play; large hand puppets for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and small hand puppets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>; and transportation toys, both the large riding type and the smaller, hand-manipulated variety. Already, picture books can inspire make-believe, especially when they depict familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and experiences. 
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this period</TIMEX>, as toddlers begin to develop the representational capacities and ï¬ne motor skills for setting up scenes themselves, they enjoy small peg <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that ï¬t in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>. Soon after, they are ready for more complex scenesâ€”dollhouse, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX>. And some start to dress up, an activity that can be supported by old clothing of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.

expanding make-believe skills: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3 years</TIMEX>.â€‚â€‚Between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 2 and 3</TIMEX>, fantasy-theme repertoires expand greatly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> take increasing responsibility for initiating and elaborating make-believe scenarios, ï¬rst with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, then with agemates. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX>, they can make use of a wider array of make-believe materialsâ€”diverse dolls, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> their own age and with physical and cultural differences they see in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>; more feeding and care accessories; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> of different types and sizes; play scenes with a larger number of peg <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and inanimate props; large and small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> for putting together pretend <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>; and a more varied array of dress-up clothing.
Around this age, placing pretend materials in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and water-play areas begins to inspire highly imaginative and extended play. Also, books, videos, and TV programs with simple narratives offer models that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> can act out and embellish in make-believe. With respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVâ</ENAMEX>€™s potential for inspiring play, programs with slow-paced, nonviolent action and easy-to-follow story lines, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œBarney and Friendsâ€ and â€œMr</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogersâ€™ Neighborhood</ENAMEX>,â€ lead to more elaborate make-believe play than do those presenting quick, disconnected bits of information<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.81</NUMEX>

blossoming of sociodramatic play: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 5 years</TIMEX>.â€‚â€‚The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid- to late-preschool years</TIMEX> are a time of burgeoning capacity for sociodramatic play, especially group pretend. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> incorporate more detail into their play themes and beneï¬t from increasingly varied and ï¬‚exible propsâ€”hand and ï¬nger puppets; dolls with articulated limbs that can be manipulated; doll clothing with buttons, zippers, and other fasteners; more housekeeping accessories, such as high chairs, bassinets, and cooking, serving, and washing equipment; and diverse play <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, including ï¬sh, reptiles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX>, and exotic species.
Older preschoolers can comprehend and recall more complex stories, and they like books and videos about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> their own age, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, and everyday life, such as a visit to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, a ï¬re <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>. They also like ridiculous, funny and dramatic, fantastic tales. Often they memorize those they like best and act them out in make-believe.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years from 3 to 5</TIMEX> are a time of peak interest in play scenes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, farm, and zoo<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.82</NUMEX> In addition to prepackaged scene sets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can be provided the raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materialsâ</ENAMEX>€”shoe boxes, pipe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cleaners</ENAMEX>, cardboard cylinders, aluminum foil, and art suppliesâ€”to create their own scenes. Whereas realistic toys encourage preschoolers to act out everyday roles, nonspeciï¬c materials often encourage fantastic role play, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> from outer space. Fantastic roles, in turn, prompt more complex peer interaction, especially statements that plan and comment on the make-believe scenario itself, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œIâ</ENAMEX>€™ll be the pirate and you be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â</ENAMEX>€83 Since fantastic make-believe does not follow highly familiar scripts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must devote more energy to working out each episode and explaining what they are doing to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companions</ENAMEX>.
Literacy objects offer another powerful illustration of how play materials mold make-believe content. Early childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Neuman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Roskos</ENAMEX> provided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3- to 5-year-olds</TIMEX> in a child-care program with literacy-enriched housekeeping, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> areas. For example, the housekeeping area included cookbooks, coupons, recipe cards, grocery packages, and pencils and notepads for list-making. Compared to agemates in a control program without extra literacy props, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> engaged in far more complex and extended literacy-related pretending<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.84</NUMEX> They more often talked about literacy objects, pretended to read and write as part of role play, and transformed literacy props imaginatively, such as calling a cookbook a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œmagic</ENAMEX>, genie bookâ€ and a piece of paper â€œdirections for ballet lessons.â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> at the upper end of this age range start to become interested in games. At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ï¬rst</NUMEX>, simple games that depend on chance rather than strategy or skill are bestâ€”lotto, dominoes, and card games based on matching and visual memory (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concentration</ENAMEX>).
advanced sociodramatic and game play: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 8 years</TIMEX>.â€‚â€‚In the early school grades, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> display an even greater capacity to create replicas of the world around themâ€”skills that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> may build on in extended projects, such as studying a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> or the wildlife of a rain forest. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six- to 8-year-olds</TIMEX> continue to like role play, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> can use it to foster their academic development. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One third</NUMEX>-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> invented a magic carpet on which her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> â€œtraveledâ€ to different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, integrating all academic areas into the experienceâ€”reading, writing, math, science, and social studies.
Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 7 and 8</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> become more conscious of the rules of play, they like to act out scripted puppet shows and plays. As informal make-believe declines, game play strengthens. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this period</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> formulate and implement strategies and cooperate more effectively in games. They have also become interested in competition. Hence, they are ready for basic strategy gamesâ€”checkers, chess, fantasy and adventure games, word games, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> sports, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-</ENAMEX>ball and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Equipping and Arranging the Play Environment</ENAMEX>

In addition to the appropriateness of play materials, their quantity and arrangement affect the maturity and diversity of themes in childrenâ€™s make-believe. These features of the environment also inï¬‚uence the congeniality of peer interaction. 
With respect to quantity, childrenâ€™s behavior can tell us whether they have too many or too few toys. An excess of toys overwhelms and overstimulates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> is piled high with all the latest playthings is likely to cherish and play with few of them. Alternatively, poor-quality child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, widespread in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, are often underequipped with play materials. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such program that I visited, the block-building area had only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">twenty blocks</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty 2- to 5-year-olds</TIMEX>. Although a stove, table, refrigerator, and crib lined the perimeter of the housekeeping area, there were just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dolls, a handful of dishes, one pan, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> dress-up garments to inspire role play. Without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and play props to engage them, many younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> wandered aimlessly. And rather than becoming immersed in sociodramatic pursuits, older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> quarreled over the few toys available. Research conï¬rms that when playthings are in short supply, preschoolersâ€™ conï¬‚icts increase<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.85</NUMEX>
The power of play spaces to affect the variety of make-believe themes is dramatically evident in preschoolersâ€™ gender-stereotyped toy choices and pretend themes. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 2</TIMEX>, gender differences in play are evident, and they strengthen over early childhood<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.86</NUMEX> Parents vary greatly in their gender-role attitudes; the more traditional their beliefs, the more gender-stereotyped their toy purchases and the more stereotyped their childrenâ€™s play<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.87</NUMEX> In many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX>, the arrangement of play areas reinforces these sharp gender distinctions. Separate housekeeping and block-building areasâ€”hubs of preschool pretendingâ€”result in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> gathering in housekeeping, where they enact domestic roles, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> congregating in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, where they build intricate structures, play energetically with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>, and create fantastic and adventurous scenarios.
When graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl Kinsman</ENAMEX> and I collaborated with a kindergarten <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> to rearrange these play spaces, striking changes in childrenâ€™s play occurred. We removed the wall of shelves dividing housekeeping from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, joining the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one.88</NUMEX> While the shelves were in place, play was highly gender stereotyped. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> largely interacted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> of their own gender, especially when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> were in housekeeping and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>. Also, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> did enter housekeeping, their play was generally irrelevant to the goals of the setting. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> scurried on all fours around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> table, each pushing a large wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> while a traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> stood on a chair, shouting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œGreen</ENAMEX> light, go! Red light, stop!â€ 
But once the play areas were joined, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> frequently played together. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, especially, engaged in more complex play, integrating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> from both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> into their fantasy themes. Finally, negative interactions between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> declined after we removed the divider, perhaps because the more open play space reduced crowding and competition for materials. As these outcomes illustrate, play spaces often promote attitudes and practices of the surrounding cultureâ€”in ways not evident to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Our intervention encouraged this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> to think more carefully about the impact her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> design had on the quality of childrenâ€™s play experiences.


the transformation of the childâ€™s play world

The make-believe play and games of early childhood offer an inï¬‚uential route to acquiring cultural values and the self-regulation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> need to act in accord with those values. In the heat of the childâ€™s relentless requests for new toys advertised on TV and in the possession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">playmates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> seldom stop to ask the question: What activities will this toy inspire? What values will the activities teach? What social rules will my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> learn to follow? A comparison of the fantasy activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in other cultures spotlights potent lessons of the play world not given sufficient conscious consideration. 
Childrenâ€™s make-believe places greater emphasis on imaginativeness and autonomy in Western individualistic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> than in collectivist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> often conjure up fantastic roles and vie with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> for the most stimulating and inï¬‚uential of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> cultures devote <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more hours</TIMEX> to play in which they perform actions in unison. For example, in a game called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bhatto Bhatto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> act out a trip to market requiring intricate touching of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> anotherâ€™s elbows and hands as they pretend to cut and share a tasty vegetable<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.89</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On Childrenâ€™s Day</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peoples Republic of China</ENAMEX>, preschoolers gather on <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> outside their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> to perform large<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX>, highly scripted activities for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. They sing stories conveying social and moral lessons while dramatizing them with complex hand motions and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> postures, in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> acts identically. 
The personal expressiveness and role negotiation in Western childrenâ€™s play are well suited for developing innovativeness, self-reliance, and social problem-solving skillsâ€”traits important for success in Western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and work worlds. Nevertheless, Western childrenâ€™s play has been transformed into an ever-enlarging culture of conspicuous consumption encompassing a seemingly endless array of costly, fancy amusements. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> are quick to feel guilty about depriving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the latest â€œeducationalâ€ playthings or jeopardizing their integration into a peer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in which toys and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX> are a salient basis for belonging. Yet parentsâ€™ gatekeeper role with respect to play is as crucial as it is in the realm of TV. 
An important point to note is that many contemporary toys undermine imagination and self-regulation. Aggressive toys are the most worrisome. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Preschoolers</ENAMEX> who transform a stick or block into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> are doing little more than exploring a pervasive aspect of their culture. But equipping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with realistic-looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, swords, shields, and other tools of warfare is tantamount to setting up a training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground</ENAMEX> in aggression. Such toys foster both pretend and real hostility among peers<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boysâ</ENAMEX>€™ penchant for high activity, excitement, and risk taking and their view of weaponry as the ultimate in masculinity attract them to war toys. Furthermore, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> play with action ï¬gures modeled on violent TV and movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Rangers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transformers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX>, their play narrows to mimicking the charactersâ€™ televised behavior and is generally aggressive and stereotyped. Video games with violent plots in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> advance by shooting and evading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> are yet another fantasy pursuit that largely appeals to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>. A growing number of studies conï¬rm that heavy playing of such games duplicates the effects of violent TV by promoting aggression and desensitizing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to violence<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, video games, even more than TV, are riddled with ethnic and gender stereotypes<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.92</NUMEX> 
In watching what happens once fast-action video games have entered their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> express another concernâ€”that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will become addicted to these violent amusements. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 5 percent</NUMEX>, usually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, develop into â€œpassionate,â€ or excessive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> during the elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and desperately need parental intervention<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.93</NUMEX> Compared to infrequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> highly involved in video games spend less time productively, more often watching cartoons and less often reading<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.94 One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> whose son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey</ENAMEX>, spent his early childhood focused on play with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transformers</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> immersed in video games complained about the boyâ€™s mediocre grades and lamented, â€œNothing seems to interest him.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Joey</ENAMEX> spent so much time with highly stimulating video games that he came to regard slower-paced pursuits that require greater initiative to reach a goal as dull.
Of course, preschoolersâ€”even those as young as age <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3â€”beneï¬t</NUMEX> from experience with computers as long as activities are constructive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are available to support them, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are not diverted from other worthwhile activities. But in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in which family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are preoccupied with the computer, especially the Internet, time spent communicating and enjoying joint leisure activities declines<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.95</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therefore</ENAMEX>, the computerâ€™s value for acquiring new skills and information must be weighed against its potential for detracting from adultâ€“child dialogues and other family activities. 
Childrenâ€™s opportunities to engage in development-enhancing make-believe and game play are at risk in yet another way. Their lives are often heavily organized and scheduled. Many leave preschool, child-care, and primary-school settings, which may not recognize the value of play, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-afternoon</TIMEX> lessons and adult-organized sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leagues</ENAMEX>. Contributing to the rise in these adult-directed activities is a decline in neighborhood safety, making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> unwilling to allow their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to gather outside without supervision. In many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-organized games, handed down from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> to the nextâ€”for example, red rover, statues, blind manâ€™s buff, leapfrog, and endless variants on popular sportsâ€”are a thing of the past. 
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> worry that adult-structured athletics are robbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of crucial learning experiences that accrue from spontaneous game play. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> control childrenâ€™s games, place heavy pressure on them to win, and assign them to speciï¬c roles so they lose the opportunity to experiment with rules and strategies, then the arguments of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> are valid. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who join <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> so earlyâ€”by ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX>€”that the physical, cognitive, and social skills demanded are well beyond their current capabilities usually lose interest and want to drop out<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.96</NUMEX> And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> who criticize rather than encourage and do not let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> forget about defeat prompt intense anxiety in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX>. Eventually, those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> may avoid athletics entirely<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.97</NUMEX>
To safeguard childrenâ€™s learning and enthusiasm, make-believe play rather than organized sports is best for preschoolers. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are ready for game play, permitting them to select sports they enjoy, to progress at their own pace, and to participate in decisions about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> rules preserves the positive lessons discussed in this chapterâ€”in cooperation, fair play, and willingly following social rules. Finally, practice times must be adjusted to childrenâ€™s attention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spans</ENAMEX> and need for unstructured time with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> practices a week, each no longer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, is sufficient for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6- to 8-year-olds</TIMEX>.98
By observing childrenâ€™s play themes, we can discover much about the values and identities that our cultureâ€”by way of homes, child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> activitiesâ€”transmits to the next generation. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in childrenâ€™s development, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are in a prime position to design and inï¬‚uence childrenâ€™s play worlds in ways that shield them from acquiring materialistic and violent attitudes and behaviors and that accentuate playâ€™s cognitive, emotional, and social beneï¬ts. Vygotskyâ€™s theory reminds us that as long as we think carefully about the play materials we offer, the style and content of adultâ€“child play, and the social skills we encourage in childrenâ€™s peer relations, make-believe play can nurture a wide range of capacities essential for academic, social, and later-life success.
