<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jimâ</ENAMEX>€™s fear of helping 7-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anselmo</ENAMEX> with his homework, lest they create a dependent, immature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, is a peculiarly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Westernâ€”and profoundly Americanâ€”preoccupation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> typically regard young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> who must be urged toward independence. In response to researchersâ€™ queries, they frequently say that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> should be trained to be self-reliant from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ï¬rst few months</TIMEX>.1 Consequently, they place a high value on childrenâ€™s learning and doing on their own. Repeatedly relying on others for assistance is construed as weakness, uncertainty, and lack of capacity. In keeping with this view, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> worry that if their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> seek help, they may become dependent. 
A similar view permeates traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX>, where an individualistic value system prevails. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> must â€œdo their own work.â€ In the most intensely individualistic of these settings, conferring with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> is worse than dependency; it is cheating, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> go so far as to set up barriers between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX>, such as upright books and cardboard screens, to prevent it.
This emphasis on independent accomplishment is not broadly accepted around the world. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in some non-Western cultures regard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> as rather merciless in pushing their young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> toward independenceâ€”for example, when they insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> sleep alone rather than with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, or when they take pleasure in the earliest possible mastery of motor skills, such as crawling and walking, long before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> has acquired the reasoning powers to avoid steep <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> and busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadways</ENAMEX>.2
Diverse non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> stress interdependenceâ€”that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must feel intimately linked to others to become competent and self-reliant. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guatemalan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX>, eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Appalachian</ENAMEX>, and many other cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> regard newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> as psychologically separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX> whose most important task is to develop an interdependent relationship with their communityâ€”an emotional and social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> that is crucial for survival and learning<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witness</ENAMEX> the following conclusion by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> who compared <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> rearing practices: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œAn <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> motherâ€“infant relationship consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> . . . a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> motherâ€“infant relationship consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> are not divided.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€4</ENAMEX> These contrasting parenting perspectives reï¬‚ect underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and community values. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> adhere to a collectivist worldview, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> deï¬ne themselves in terms of their relationships with others.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collectivist</ENAMEX> values also alter the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> think about classroom learning. Were you to visit a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> on an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kibbutz</ENAMEX> (cooperative agricultural settlement), you would ï¬nd an explicit emphasis on cooperation and avoidance of pupil comparisons, and a far more positive attitude toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who seek help than is common in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. When asked why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> look at each othersâ€™ work, kibbutz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> mention the importance of connecting with others to acquire new skills. They explain, â€œIf your picture looks crooked, you would want to see your friendâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> to learn how to make it straight,â€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œIf you arenâ€™t sure what youâ€™re supposed to do, then you should check.â€ To the same question, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> typically respond, â€œI would want to see whose picture was the best,â€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œI might be wondering whether she got more right than I did.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€5</ENAMEX> 


from interdependency to autonomy

Vygotsky, who studied and wrote about childrenâ€™s development in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early twentieth century</TIMEX>, was deeply interested in how interdependencyâ€”childrenâ€™s close ties to their communityâ€”can pave the way to competence and autonomy. His sociocultural theory has thoroughly collectivist cultural roots. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> stressed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> need social interaction and meaningful activities to develop, and he regarded high intrinsic motivation and mature, independent functioning as arising from the support granted by cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> attempt ever more challenging tasks. The childâ€™s mind, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> pointed out, â€œextends beyond the skinâ€ and is inseparably joined with other minds. Out of this interconnection springs mastery, proï¬ciency, and self-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">conï¬dence.6</NUMEX>
Nevertheless, a deeply ingrained <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> belief is that satisfying a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childâ</ENAMEX>€™s desire for social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> and assistance will be habit forming, leading to a clingy, spoiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">youngster</ENAMEX>. Much evidence veriï¬es that this is not ordinarily so.
Consider the early attachment bond that builds between caregiver and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ï¬rst year</TIMEX> of life. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 6 to 8 months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> single out their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other stable, loving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caregivers</ENAMEX> for expressions of joy and turn to them for comfort when anxious and afraid. An overwhelming consensus of research shows that sensitive caregivingâ€”responding to the babyâ€™s cries for physical care and stimulation promptly, consistently, and appropriatelyâ€”supports the development of a secure attachment relationship<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Securely</ENAMEX> attached <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> actively seek contact with and are easily consoled by their familiar, responsive caregiver. Yet such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> are not destined to become immaturely dependent! Rather, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the ï¬rst year</TIMEX>, their exploration of the physical world is conï¬dent, persistent, and complex. And they are less likely to cry and more likely to use gestures and words to express their desires than are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> delayed or failed to respond to their calls for help<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> 
Sensitive care builds an interdependent relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and babyâ€”one in which physical and emotional closeness becomes the context for encouraging more mature behavior. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attachment</ENAMEX> serves as the springboard for a great many capacities that make their ï¬rst appearance in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> yearâ€”self-conï¬dence, compliance and cooperation; awareness of othersâ€™ needs and desires, and empathy and sympathy (emotions that enable us to feel for and help others in need)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> who fails to respond promptly and predictably, intervening only after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> has become extremely agitated, teaches the infant to rise rapidly to intense distress. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> has learned that only when he is distraught will the parent reliably come to his aid. As a result, he is more dicult to soothe, to encourage to communicate in ways other than crying, and to guide in acquiring other vital competencies<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX>
An analogous circumstance exists at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">older ages</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselmoâ</ENAMEX>€™s interactions with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> reveal. Jimâ€™s refusal to help <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anselmo</ENAMEX> with his homework, in hopes of instilling independence, is counterproductive. Anselmoâ€™s crying and pleading accelerate, to the point that anxiety prevents him from focusing on the task. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denying Anselmo</ENAMEX> assistance yields precisely what it was intended to preventâ€”a dependent, doubting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselmoâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> refrain from helping, they fuel his anger and demandingness, and ultimately his sense of helplessness. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talia ï¬nally</ENAMEX> responds, she does so out of desperationâ€”to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselmoâ</ENAMEX>€™s agitated appeals, which are about to escalate beyond control. Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talia</ENAMEX> assists inappropriately, by doing the task for him.
Anselmoâ€™s resulting disorganized behavior and dependency prompt additional parental vacillationâ€”sometimes refusals to help, at other times maladaptive helpingâ€”along with exasperation and criticism. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> can be heard saying impatiently, â€œYou arenâ€™t any good at this<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">!â€ â€œCanâ</ENAMEX>€™t you do anything?â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">€11</NUMEX> Soon a barrier forms between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselmo</ENAMEX> and the task he had previously wanted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>, and his motivation wanes.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX>, the same sequence of events prevails. Teachersâ€™ communication plays a vital role in childrenâ€™s eort and learning. Consider a recent study, in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600</NUMEX> elementary- and middle-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> were followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a 3-year</TIMEX> period. Those who viewed their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> as warm and as providing helpful learning conditionsâ€”by making expectations clear and checking that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> understoodâ€”worked harder on assignments and participated more in class. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eort</ENAMEX> and participation, in turn, predicted better academic performance, which sustained the childâ€™s willingness to try hard in the future. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who regarded their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> as unsupportive were more likely to disengage, stop trying, and show declines in achievement. These negative outcomes led <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to doubt their own ability, which perpetuated their reduced eort<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX>
How can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> build interdependent relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that foster the development of culturally meaningful skills and mature, autonomous behavior? To answer this question, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> proposed a special concept: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of proximal development. Keeping it in mind can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in ways that lead their development forward. 


the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of proximal development

Take a few moments to list ï¬ve or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> competencies of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> you know well. If you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, do so for your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>; if you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, choose a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. Perhaps your list looks much like this one, recorded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyrone</ENAMEX>: 

Just learned to cut paper with scissors.
Counts to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>.
Looks at picture books and names many pictures.
Remembered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> we saw at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Sunday</TIMEX>. 
Puts together puzzles with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> pieces.
Can sort shapes into categories.
Now indicate whether the skills on your list are ones that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can do by himself, or whether they are ones that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> displays only when assisted by another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>, like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> completing this exercise, limited her list to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyroneâ€™s</ENAMEX> already acquired abilitiesâ€”ones he can do alone. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> pointed out that we are used to thinking of the childâ€™s capacities in static or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œfossilizedâ€ termsâ€”as ï¬nished achievements</ENAMEX>. In doing so, we look toward the past. What we should do, he advised, is to move beyond what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can do by themselves to what they can do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> assistance and, therefore, have the potential to learn. In this way, we focus on the futureâ€”on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cognitive</ENAMEX> processes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> rather than those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, which are already mastered<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> 
Vygotsky deï¬ned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of proximal development as the distance between the childâ€™s actual development (the tasks the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can do individually) and the childâ€™s potential development, â€œdetermined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€14 The â€œzone</ENAMEX>,â€ as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iâ</ENAMEX>€™ll call it from now on, is the dynamic region in which new capacities form as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> tackle culturally meaningful tasks with a mentorâ€™s assistance. Had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> been thinking about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Tyroneâ€™s â€œzone</ENAMEX>,â€ she might have framed the items on her list this way: 

Just learned to cut paper with scissors. If I hold the paper while he cuts and prompt him, he can cut along straight or curved lines. He cut out a square and a circle with help <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. I asked him which animals we saw at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, and he mentioned girae and zebra. When I reminded him of the bird and pachyderm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, he remembered a lot more: the ï¬‚amingos, parrots, swans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>, hippos, and rhinos.

For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX>, a crucial aspect of parenting and the central aim of education is to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with experiences in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€â€”activities</ENAMEX> that challenge them but that can be accomplished with sensitive adult guidance. Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> carry much responsibility for ensuring that childrenâ€™s learning is maximizedâ€”for actively leading them along the developmental pathway. Rather than transmitting ready-made knowledge to a passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or giving a child tasks for which he or she already has the requisite skills, the adultâ€™s role is to engage in dialogue with the childâ€”by observing, conversing, questioning, assisting, and encouraging. During that dialogue, the adult continually assesses the childâ€™s progress and creates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> by keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">task â€œproximalâ€â€”slightly</ENAMEX> above the childâ€™s level of independent functioning. In this way, the adult â€œrouses to lifeâ€ those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cognitive</ENAMEX> processes that are just emerging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>,15 sustaining them socially so they can be reï¬ned and internalized as part of the childâ€™s psychological world.


creating the â€œzoneâ€

What features of adultâ€“child shared activity forge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX>? Research documents several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">communicative ingredients</ENAMEX> that consistently foster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">development</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of diverse ages and across a wide range of tasks.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shared Understanding</ENAMEX>

For information, ideas, and skills to move from the social-interactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> to the internal-thinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, the adult and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> must strive for a common approach to the situation. They must desire genuine communication and work toward attaining it. 
In sociocultural theory, this joint, mutual focus is called intersubjectivity, or shared understanding<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX> As the word suggests, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in the dialogue strives to grasp the subjective perspective of the other, an eort that results in a â€œmeeting of minds,â€ in which the partnersâ€™ thoughts make contact, connect, and coincide. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Intersubjectivity</ENAMEX> reaches its pinnacle in a love aair, where shared understanding is readily achieved through a glance, a touch, or a comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lovers</ENAMEX> in close psychological contact grasp <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> anotherâ€™s meanings quickly because each is on the lookout for and tries to satisfy the otherâ€™s needs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX> The opposite of intersubjectivity is total misunderstanding. In a failed love aair, widely divergent views of the same experiences cause <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to say, â€œYou donâ€™t understand me. Youâ€™ve become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX>. We canâ€™t ï¬nd common ground. Weâ€™ve grown apart.â€
The image of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> communicating helps us appreciate the circumstances in which intersubjectivity is most likely to occur: in close relationships. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> most often attain it with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and eventually in friendships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in teaching and learning do not need to attain the intersubjective heights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> to accomplish their goals. But a certain degree of intersubjectivity is necessary for any dialogue to be successful, and the love aair analogy reminds us that joint understanding, whether established in face-to-face interaction or as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> work on a common task, combines both verbal and nonverbal cues. Sensitive emotional messages conveyed through gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice are basic to it<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intersubjectivity</ENAMEX> is itself a developmental process. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are still acquiring communication skills, the younger the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, the greater the adultâ€™s responsibility for making mental contact and sustaining the interaction. Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of all ages actively join in, striving for a shared view of the world. Their participation results in gains in thought, language, and social skills. Gradually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> takes increasing responsibility for attaining intersubjectivity, until both parties make similar contributions to the shared mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX> childrenâ€™s learning in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzone</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€19 Letâ</ENAMEX>€™s see how, with adult support, the childâ€™s intersubjective competence increases. 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infancy</ENAMEX> and toddlerhood.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€‚â€‚Some</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> believe that the infantâ€™s capacity to share meaning with others is innate. Others think it is learnedâ€”that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> respond to infantsâ€™ facial expressions, vocalizations, cries, and body movements as if they have meaning, and out of those responses <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> pick up the meanings and expressive rhythms of human signals<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> But all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> agree that subtle, sensitive, and mutually rewarding exchanges between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> serve as the earliest context for intersubjectivity. 
From the start, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> are equipped with capacities that draw <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> into social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> with them. Newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, for example, can make eye contact, and they prefer to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and to listen to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">voicesâ</ENAMEX>€”especially their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motherâ€™s</ENAMEX> familiar voice, to which they became accustomed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> before birth<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newborns</ENAMEX> also have a rudimentary ability to imitate facial expressions, opening their mouths or pursing their lips after an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> does so<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> Their responsiveness encourages <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to look at, talk to, and imitate in return. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 4 and 6 weeks of age</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> begin to smile at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, an irresistible signal that evokes smiles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cuddles</ENAMEX>, pats, and friendly, gentle verbalizations from their social world<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX> As cooing and babbling appear in the ï¬rst <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">half-year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> again respond in kind, vocalizing and waiting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> to vocalize back.
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3 months</TIMEX>, a complex communication system is in place in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> each respond in an appropriate and carefully timed fashion to the otherâ€™s cues. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> experience and practice the give-and-take of human conversation. Disrupt this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of signals, and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babiesâ</ENAMEX>€™ striving for connection with others becomes crystal clear. In several studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> had the parent assume either a still-faced, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unreactive</ENAMEX> pose or a depressed emotional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Infants</ENAMEX> tried all manner of signalsâ€”facial expressions, vocalizations, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> movementsâ€”to get their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> to respond again. When these eorts failed, they reacted to the parentâ€™s sad, vacant gaze by turning away, frowning, and crying<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3- to 6-month-olds</TIMEX> respond to a parentâ€™s still face identically, suggesting a common, built-in protest response to caregiversâ€™ lack of engagement<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.25</NUMEX>
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are attentive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and interested in the babyâ€™s activities, their social signals sustain the infantâ€™s attention, essential for a shared focus. Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> begin to gaze in the same direction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are looking, although their initial eorts are imperfect. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> follow the babyâ€™s line of vision as well, often commenting on what the infant sees. This joint attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and events fosters early language development. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> who maintain high levels of it during play have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> who comprehend more language, produce meaningful gestures and words earlier, and show faster vocabulary development between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 and 2 years</TIMEX> of age<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 9 and 15 months</TIMEX>, the capacity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intersubjectivity</ENAMEX> takes a giant leap forward. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toddlers</ENAMEX> use gestures to share their experiences with others. They touch an object, hold it up, or point to it while looking at another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to make sure he or she notices. Or they try to get another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to do somethingâ€”to hand them an object or help them perform a taskâ€”by reaching, pointing, and making sounds at the same time<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.27</NUMEX> 
Look closely at these behaviors, and notice how toddlers intentionally try to establish common ground with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> by combining their interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and events with communication<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.28</NUMEX> When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> respond to their reaching and pointing gestures and also label them (â€œThatâ€™s a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kitty</ENAMEX>, isnâ€™t it<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">?â€ â€œOh</ENAMEX>, you want a cracker<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">!â€</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddlers</ENAMEX> learn that using language can quickly lead to a joint focus and desired resultsâ€”the pleasurable object or experience the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> wanted<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX> Soon the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> utters words along with gestures, the gestures recede, and language is under way.

early childhood.<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€‚â€‚Spoken language</ENAMEX> brings vastly expanded potential for attaining intersubjectivity because it allows much greater clariï¬cation of purpose between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in a dialogue. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX> points and reaches but cannot say what he means, the adult may need to search for the childâ€™s meaning, as this exchange between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-month-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>, illustrates: 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Points</ENAMEX> to one of the objects on the counter)
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mother: â</ENAMEX>€œDo you want this?â€ (Holds up milk container) 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>: (Shakes his head <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œnoâ€</ENAMEX>; continues to point; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more tries) 
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mother: â€œThis?â€</ENAMEX> (Picks up sponge) 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leans</ENAMEX> back in highchair, puts arms down, tension leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hands Jordan</ENAMEX> sponge)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
As language competence increases, shared meaning is established quickly, as when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> says, â€œGet the sponge, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX>. I need to wipe this up<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">!â</NUMEX>€ Then a joint focus becomes the springboard for achieving greater understanding, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> playing a strong, contributing role. This is evident in the impressive conversational skills of even young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> take turns, make eye contact, and respond in a timely and relevant fashion to their partnerâ€™s remarks<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX>
These capacities improve with conversational experience. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> become better at taking the perspective of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, especially a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> who adjusts his or her communication to the childâ€™s level and observes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> closely to assess his or her comprehension. By stretching up to grasp the adultâ€™s viewpoint, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> acquire new knowledge, the basis for further growth. And with age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> exert greater eort to understand another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, a capacity ï¬rst cultivated in adultâ€“child interaction and then extended to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. For example, in the following conversation, notice how <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX> assists his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leah</ENAMEX>, in attaining intersubjectivity:

(<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leah</ENAMEX> tells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> that she caught a fish while on vacation, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX> enters the conversation.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teacher</ENAMEX>: Did you have to scale the ï¬sh as well?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leah</ENAMEX>: No, we eated them. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> misunderstands the meaning of the word â€œscale.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX>: You need to peel them . . . peel them. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX> tries to clarify.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teacher</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confirming Sammyâ</ENAMEX>€™s meaning) You need to take the scales o, donâ€™t you?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX>: You canâ€™t do it with your hands; you need a peeler.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teacher</ENAMEX>: Or a knife . . . a really sharp ï¬shing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leah</ENAMEX>: They peeled the ï¬shes with a fork. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leah</ENAMEX> now shares meaning with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX>.)32

<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 3 and 5 years of age</TIMEX>, preschoolers increasingly strive for intersubjectivity in dialogues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. They more often arm playmatesâ€™ messages, add new information to playmatesâ€™ ideas, and make contributions to ongoing play to sustain it further<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX> They can also be heard making such statements as, â€œI think [this way]. What do you think?â€â€”clear evidence of a willingness to share viewpoints, which assists preschoolers greatly when conï¬‚icts arise that must be resolved for play to continue.34 
As the excerpts we have considered illustrate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in a dialogue may not attain intersubjectivity on a ï¬rst try, and interaction between most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, is not perfectly â€œin sync.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â</ENAMEX>€35 But by the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can take a more active role in helping a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> reach a state of shared thinking and in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">correcting â€œmissesâ€</ENAMEX> when they do occur<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.36</NUMEX>
The communicative competence inherent in intersubjectivity blossoms within a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of proximal development in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other signiï¬cant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are â€œstimulating, attentive, conï¬rmatory, interpretive, and highly supportive.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€37 Parentâ</ENAMEX>€“child intersubjectivity makes a vital contribution to the development of attachment, attention, language, and understanding of othersâ€™ perspectives. These capacities, in turn, ease the task of establishing an intersubjective connection, and that connection provides the platform for the creation of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">additional â</NUMEX>€œzones,â€ enabling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to master complex, culturally adaptive skills. 

Building a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Support System for Acquiring New Knowledge and Skills</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intersubjectivity</ENAMEX> makes possible a second essential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> for creating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX>: a support system that oers new ways of thinking about a situation. The quality of adult support varies with the type of joint activity. As we will see, a helpful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> interacts dierently when assisting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with tasks having clear learning goals, such as working a puzzle or mastering a homework assignment; when engaging the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in an open-ended conversation; and when enlisting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in duties and routines of everyday living. But regardless of the activity, the adult adapts his or her support so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can make use of it. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> gains competence, adult support changes accordingly, granting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> a larger role. 

creating a scaffold.â€‚â€‚The metaphor of a scaffold has been used to describe eective adult support as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> work on tasks that teach culturally valued concepts and skills<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38</NUMEX> The learning goal might be built into the task materials, as when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> turns a crank to make a jack-in-the-box pop out, puts together a puzzle, or builds a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> out of blocks. Alternatively, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> might specify the goal, as in matching shapes and colors, solving an arithmetic problem, or batting a ball. 
In scaolding, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is viewed as a buildingâ€”actively under construction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> provides a dynamic, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ï¬‚exible scaoldâ€”or frameworkâ€”that</ENAMEX> assists the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in mastering new competencies. To promote development, the adult varies his or her assistance to ï¬t the childâ€™s changing level of performance, with the goal of keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzone</ENAMEX>.â€ This is usually done in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) by adjusting the task so the demands on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> at any given moment are appropriately challenging, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) tailoring the degree of adult intervention to the childâ€™s current learning needs<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.39</NUMEX> 
When a task is very new, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> may not yet be aware of its goal and need to be shown what to do, through demonstration. Consider, for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 9-month-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX> who has never before seen a jack-in-the-box. At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ï¬rst</NUMEX>, the adult tries to capture the childâ€™s attention by working the toy and, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clown</ENAMEX> emerges, exclaiming, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">â€œPop</ENAMEX>! What happened<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?â€ Gradually</ENAMEX>, the adult redirects interaction toward how to use the jack-in-the-box. When the infant reaches for the toy, the adult guides the childâ€™s hand in turning the crank and pushing the clown down in the box. As motor, cognitive, and language skills improve in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX> intentionally tries to turn the crank, looking at the adult or otherwise beckoning for assistance. The childâ€™s greater knowledge and communicative competence permit the adult to reduce her physical directiveness. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> can help from a distance by using verbal instructions (â€œTurn, just a little more!â€) and gestures, such as a rotating hand resembling a turning motion, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddler</ENAMEX> tries to make the toy work<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.40</TIMEX> 
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> move into the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, scaolding becomes increasingly verbal and takes on the advantages of languageâ€”more ready attainment of intersubjectivity; ï¬‚exible, ecient representation of meanings; and a powerful tool through which minds meet and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> adopts meanings into mental life. To illustrate, letâ€™s listen in as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> assists his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>, in putting together a dicult puzzle:

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>: I canâ€™t get this one in. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tries</ENAMEX> to insert a piece in the wrong place)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: Which piece might go down here? (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Points</ENAMEX> to the bottom of the puzzle)
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>: His shoes. (Looks for a piece resembling the clownâ€™s shoes but tries the wrong <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: Well, ï¬nd a piece that looks like this shape and matches this color. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Points</ENAMEX> again to the bottom of the puzzle)
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>: The brown <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. (Tries it and it fits; then attempts another piece and looks at her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: There you have it! Now try turning that piece just a little. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gestures</ENAMEX> to show her)
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>: There! (Puts in several more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> while commenting to herself, â€œNow a green piece to match,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â</ENAMEX>€œTurn it [meaning the puzzle piece],â€ as the adult watches)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>, watch. Suppose I put this piece here. Will that work? (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Places</ENAMEX> a blue piece next to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> blue piece, but the space is too small and the wrong shape)
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>: You canâ€™t do it that way. The piece is too big.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX>: What should I do?
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX>: (Places the piece in the correct space, using both color and shape as a guide.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> and her fatherâ€™s interaction contains all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> and goals of eective scaolding:

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Problem Solving</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aimed at Keeping the Child in the â€œZone</ENAMEX>.â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> collaborate in overcoming obstacles that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> encounters. In doing so, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> jointly work toward successful puzzle solution. 
Sydneyâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> keeps the task within <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sydneyâ€™s â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> by temporarily reducing the diculty of the puzzle. He does so by breaking the task into smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, focusing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydneyâ</ENAMEX>€™s attention on the lower sectionâ€”the part with the largest and most easily matched pieces. Then he assists with a general prompt, â€œWhich piece might go down here?â€ 
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sydneyâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> observes that this suggestion is not sucient for her to succeed, he oers additional support, â€œFind a piece that looks like this shape and matches this colorâ€ and â€œTurn it.â€ His statements contain strategies (attending to color and shape, patiently adjusting pieces so they ï¬t) that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> can use in future attempts. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> experiments with the color-matching strategy and succeeds in placing the brown piece, she internalizes the technique. She applies it in subsequent eorts, regulating her behavior with self-directed language resembling her fatherâ€™s communication during joint problem solving. Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> begins to move toward independent solving of the puzzle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how, in scaolding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydneyâ</ENAMEX>€™s puzzle solving, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> adapts the instruction he oers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydneyâ</ENAMEX>€™s momentary competence. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> has diculty, he fortiï¬es the scaold, providing increased direction. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> starts to take over strategies generated during joint problem solving, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> pulls back, reducing the assistance provided.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scaolding</ENAMEX> provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> with a sensible solution to the often-raised dilemma: Is it better to be directive or nondirective when helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learn? As the scaolding concept shows, this question has no pat answer. Rather, the intensity of adult support depends on where the task falls within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">childâ€™s â€œzone</ENAMEX>.â€ When a task lies at the outer edge of the childâ€™s current capabilities, more direct guidance is necessary to bring it within range of mastery. As the childâ€™s understanding and performance improve, less intervention is required. 
How much assistance a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> needs depends not just on cognitive maturity but also on other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> characteristics. A temperamentally distractible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, an emotionally reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, or a fearful, inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> requires an especially sturdy scaoldâ€”extra support and, at times, considerable adult perseverance to sustain a joint focus and keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> engaged. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who are good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>, persistent in the face of diculty, socially skilled, and therefore adept at attaining intersubjectivity need less adult vigilance and direction. At the same time, eective scaolding can improve a dicult childâ€™s behavior, since it oers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> knowledge and procedures for solving problems, the security of adult support as long as it is needed, and the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles and mastering culturally valued skills. 
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-regulation</ENAMEX>. An important goal of scaolding is to promote self-regulationâ€”the capacity to use thought to guide behavior. The self-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> follows social rules; makes deliberate, well-reasoned choices and decisions; and takes responsibility for his or her own learning and behavior. Although self-regulation improves gradually throughout childhood and adolescence, early childhood is a crucial period for its developmentâ€”a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learn to overcome impulses by thinking before they act<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.41</NUMEX> Indeed, self-regulation is so important for childrenâ€™s cognitive and social development that we will return to it repeatedly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> chapters when we consider how other experiencesâ€”childrenâ€™s self-directed language, make-believe play, and learning in schoolâ€”contribute to it. 
How does scaolding nurture a self-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>? It does so in two interrelated ways: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) by providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with strategies for working toward goals, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) by relinquishing adult control and assistance as soon as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can work independently<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.42</NUMEX> 
In scaolding, the adult encourages the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to grapple with questions and problems and, thereby, to contribute signiï¬cantly to the dialogue. In this way, the adult evokes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> his or her current knowledge and, on that basis, can scaold more eectively. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> intervenes only when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is truly stuck, granting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> as much opportunity to master his or her own behavior as possible. Unless it is clear that the task is so new and obscure to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> that a demonstration would be helpful, the adult refrains from giving immediate answers to momentary diculties. As our consideration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselmo</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> revealed, doing the task for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> severely reduces learning and self-regulation<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.43</NUMEX>
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> questions and make suggestions that permit them to participate in the discovery of solutions, then transfer of useful strategies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is maximized. By introducing language as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of the childâ€™s activity, the adultâ€™s questions and prompts prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> from responding impulsively. They encourage the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to step back from the immediate situation and consider alternativesâ€”in essence, to think. 
Look at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> and her fatherâ€™s dialogue once again. When he asks, â€œWhich piece might go down here?â€ he evokes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydneyâ</ENAMEX>€™s present strategic thinking, ï¬nding that it is still tied to immediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in the situation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sydney</ENAMEX> looks for the clownâ€™s shoes but fails to ï¬nd them. Then her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> introduces a special form of strategic thinking called distancing. This method helps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> move beyond concrete objects by looking for higher-order relationshipsâ€”in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sydneyâ€™s</ENAMEX> case, categorizing puzzle pieces by color and shape. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> succeeds in using color, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> encourages further distancing from the most obvious features of the clown image<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX> He places a piece incorrectly (by matching only on color) and queries, â€œWill that work?â€ In doing so, he helps <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sydney</ENAMEX> analyze an error, consider how to correct it (by matching on both color and shape), and try out her conjecture. Sydney gains practice in applying strategies ï¬‚exiblyâ€”in generating ideas to overcome obstacles. As a result, she acquires reasoning skills and can take initiative when faced with future problems.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warmth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Responsiveness</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Encouragement</ENAMEX>. To work well, the emotional tone of scaolding must be warm, sympathetic, and responsive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who experience warm adult relationships want to preserve that spirit of aection and cooperationâ€”by joining in dialogues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult partners</ENAMEX> and acquiring culturally valued skills<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.45</NUMEX>
The standards for maturity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> set for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> vary widely, in ways that reï¬‚ect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and cultural values. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese-American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant parents</ENAMEX> report spending nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times as much time as do Caucasian-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> scaolding their school-age childrenâ€™s mastery of reading, math, music, and drawing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">skills46â€”teaching</TIMEX> that is undoubtedly a strong contributor to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ</ENAMEX>€™s high achievement in both academic and artistic endeavors. Inï¬‚uenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucian</ENAMEX> belief in strict discipline to nurture socially desirable behavior, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> expect a great deal of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and structure their time extensively<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.47</NUMEX> But research indicates that their demands are imbued with warmth and caringâ€”with deep concern for and involvement in their childrenâ€™s lives. 
In a study of parenting in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">180</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Rohner</ENAMEX> found that warmth combined with at least moderate expectations for mature behavior and accomplishment is the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing style around the world<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.48</NUMEX> Why do so many cultures mingle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> and aection with guidance and controlâ€”a blend known as authoritative parenting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing literature? Certainly because they sense its eectiveness, borne out by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of research. 
Authoritative parenting, whether assessed through direct observation or older childrenâ€™s ratings of their parentsâ€™ communication, is linked to many aspects of competence. In early childhood, it predicts positive mood, self-conï¬dence and independence in mastery of new tasks, cooperativeness, and resistance to engaging in disruptive behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.49</NUMEX> And in middle childhood, adolescence, and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adulthood</ENAMEX>, it is related to high self-esteem, social and moral maturity, academic achievement, and educational attainment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.50</NUMEX>
A major contributor to these favorable outcomes is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> that warmth grants to adult expectations. Warm, caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> oer explanations and justiï¬cations for their demands. In doing so, they invite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to judge the appropriateness of their requirements. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> view demands as fair and reasonable, they are far more likely to heed and internalize them. A warm, involved adult is also more likely to be an eective reinforcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, praising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for striving to meet high standards. And when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> stray from goals that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> regards as important and it is necessary to be ï¬rm and disapproving, a warm adult has a much greater chance of changing the childâ€™s behavior than does an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> who has been indierent or negative. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> of involved, caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> ï¬nd the interruption in parental aection that accompanies a reprimand to be especially unpleasant. They want to regain their parentsâ€™ warmth and approval as quickly as possible.
In sum, scaolding is a warm, sympathetic collaboration between a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and a learner on a challenging, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goal-</ENAMEX>directed task that the adult helps bring within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">childâ€™s â€œzone</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Observations</ENAMEX> of adultâ€“child pairs reveal that the diverse ingredients of scaoldingâ€”matching the adultâ€™s assistance to the childâ€™s changing needs, suggesting eective strategies, posing questions that encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to think about higher-order relationships, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interacting</ENAMEX> warmly and praising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for competent performanceâ€”consistently relate to childrenâ€™s task engagement and learning<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.51</NUMEX>

the power of conversation.â€‚â€‚The instructional mode of communication inherent in scaolding is well suited for tasks with clearly deï¬ned goals. Conversations, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> reï¬‚ect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX> events, are more free-ranging. They can dwell on virtually any aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">experienceâ€”of</ENAMEX> living and working together. This makes them an especially powerful tool for assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in building an internal mental life infused with a cultural worldview.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> converse with one another, they engage in a form of dialogue called narrativeâ€”a storylike mode of communicating, composed of a sequence of events with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. In the narrative, which may be real or imaginary, charactersâ€™ roles and mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">statesâ€”feelings</ENAMEX>, intentions, beliefs, opinions, and knowledgeâ€”are revealed<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.52</NUMEX> 
To illustrate, suppose someone asked you to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œtell the story of your life.â€ In forming a spontaneous autobiography, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> link together smaller stories about incidents and occasions, with the self at their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and other inï¬‚uential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in supporting roles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> arranges the stories sequentially, to conform to a culturally accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of time. And he or she not only recounts, but justifies the storiesâ€”that is, makes them comprehensible by explaining why they happened as they did<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.53</NUMEX> 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>stories in our life narratives focus on exceptional experiencesâ€”events that stand out against the backdrop of ordinariness in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> lives<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.54</NUMEX> For example, a move to a new neighborhood, a ï¬rst date, a high school graduation, an important job interview, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wedding day</TIMEX>, the birth of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, and special achievements or failings are likely to be included. The various entries are derived from our social interactions, at the time the events occurred and thereafter. When others join with us in celebration, approve or disapprove of our actions, or convey information or opinion that changes our outlook, they bestow special meaning on the events. And so we include those events in our autobiographies, elevating them to lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">signiï¬cance</ENAMEX>. 
In everyday conversation, the events discussed resemble the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>stories of our spontaneous autobiographies. For example, in recent narrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX>, I talked with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> about her daughterâ€™s sudden breakup with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ï¬ancÃ©</ENAMEX>; with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> about a controversial play we had seen; and with one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> about how she might handle a troublesome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX>. Each narrative focused on a relatively exceptional personal experience. And in each, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and I addressed the legitimacy of charactersâ€™ intentions, weighing personal desire against socially acceptable behavior. 
For example, referring to her daughterâ€™s breakup, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> complained, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œIt wasnâ€™t</ENAMEX> that she did it but how she did it. She shouldnâ€™t have promised sheâ€™d join him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and then reneged. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> called <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX> and said how betrayed the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> feels. You canï<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">¿½ï¿½ï¿½t</ENAMEX> back out like that, with no warning, no explanation, after he had already rented the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>.â€ 
â€œThe whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> knew the relationship had problems,â€ I countered. â€œSheâ€™s paying him for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. Doesnâ€™t that lighten her obligation?â€ 
During the conversation, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and I exchanged a wealth of cultural meanings about how relationships should be and about the maturity and morality of the daughterâ€™s behavior. The telling of the narrative also invited reconstruction of what might have occurred between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and her ï¬ancÃ©, thereby placing the event in a wider context of possibilities. In the process, the dialogue highlighted charactersâ€™ internal statesâ€”the daughterâ€™s motivations, her boyfriendâ€™s feelings, and my friendâ€™s struggle to make sense of the breakup.
Readiness for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narrative</ENAMEX>. Our narrative dialogues with young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have the same features as do our narratives with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, only in simpliï¬ed form. In these conversations, we arrange events in logical, sequential order, and we focus on explaining unusual, hard-to-interpret occurrences, often by dwelling on charactersâ€™ intentions and perspectives.
Even before they begin to talk, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> display a readiness to participate in narrative<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.55</NUMEX> After an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> describes and demonstrates some activity (for example, putting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">teddy bear</ENAMEX> to bed), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-year-olds</TIMEX> who as yet have little language can easily reproduce the main steps in correct sequence with toys<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.56</NUMEX> When toddlers begin to speak, their main interest is in talking about what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do and the consequences of their behavior. Listen to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-word utterances that appear between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 and 24 months of age</TIMEX>, and you will ï¬nd many expressions like these: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œTommy hitâ€</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œGet cookieâ€</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œMommy truckâ€</ENAMEX> (meaning â€œMommy push the truckâ€); <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œDaddy outsideâ€</ENAMEX>; and â€œMy dolly.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â</ENAMEX>€57 At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the second year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> begin to label their own and othersâ€™ internal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with words, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œwant,â€ â€œhappy,â€ â€œmad,â€ â€œthink,â€ and â€œpretend</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€58</ENAMEX> These assertions about human action, desire, emotion, and perspective are the stu of which narratives are made.
Early on, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are sensitive to yet another feature of narrative. At birth, they are captivated by unusual events, perking up their eyes and ears when something new and dierent happens. In keeping with this innate bias, the ï¬rst narratives <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> produce focus on making sense of the atypical. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œLook</ENAMEX>, the sun is sleepy, going to bed,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 1/2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">David</ENAMEX> while watching the sun disappear below the horizon at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of a day</TIMEX> at the beach. At the sight of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with her leg in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachel</ENAMEX> remarked, â€œMommy, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> got a big cut. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> sewed up her leg.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rachelâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> had cut his leg <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days earlier</TIMEX> and returned from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> with stitches and a bandage.)
An early armament of narrative tools enables <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to quickly and easily comprehend and contribute to the narratives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert members</ENAMEX> of their culture<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.59</NUMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend much time together, the ï¬‚ow of stories recreating personal experiences is abundant<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.60</NUMEX> Through them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> construct increasingly elaborate images of themselves and teach them culturally accepted ways of organizing and interpreting their experiences. As a byproduct of participation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> gain a rich understanding of their own and othersâ€™ mental livesâ€”powerful tools in predicting and explaining human behavior and, therefore, in getting along with others. And in enabling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to practice and perfect narrative skills, adultâ€“child conversation provides crucial preparation for literacy. Letâ€™s take a closer look at these diverse beneï¬ts of narrative conversation.
Forming an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autobiographical Self</ENAMEX>. Consider, once again, the narrative task posed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, to relate â€œthe story of your life.â€ Think back to the earliest event you can remember. At what age did it occur?
For the large majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, memory for autobiographical events begins around age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.61</NUMEX> Practically none of us can retrieve happenings at younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agesâ</ENAMEX>€”a phenomenon called infantile amnesia. What causes this early memory blackout, and how is it that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3</TIMEX>, certain events dierentiate themselves from a multitude of everyday experiences so they stand out for a lifetime?
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> conjecture that growth of the cerebral cortex and other brain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> is necessary before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can store experiences in ways that permit them to be retrieved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years later</TIMEX>.62 Similarly, several psychological explanations focus on changes in the nature of memory during the preschool yearsâ€”from an unconscious, automatic, and nonverbal system to one that is conscious, deliberate, and verbal<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.63</NUMEX> Perhaps the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> system cannot access events stored by the ï¬rst, making the earliest events of our lives forever irretrievable.
Yet the idea of vastly dierent approaches to remembering at young and older ages has been questioned. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1/2 to 3</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> can describe their memories verbally<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.64</NUMEX> And sometimes they even recall events that happened to them as preverbal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>! For example, while walking past a distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a fenced-in front yard, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22-month-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lisa</ENAMEX> said to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œScary doggy!â€</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nine months earlier</TIMEX> (before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> could talk), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> had taken the same walk. On that occasion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lisa</ENAMEX> had seen a ferocious dog barking behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-linked fence. Over time, neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> walk nor the scary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> will be part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lisaâ</ENAMEX>€™s personally relevant memory. Yet the train trip across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> she will take at age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1/2</NUMEX> and her ï¬rst day of kindergarten at age 5 may still be memorable when she is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>.
A growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> believe that rather than a radical change in the way experience is coded into memory, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other milestones lead infantile amnesia to give way to memory for personally signiï¬cant experiences: 

1.A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psychological Self</ENAMEX>. To build an autobiographical memory, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must have a well-formed sense of selfâ€”as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who, despite changes in appearance (a new haircut, becoming taller and more mature looking), remains the same on the inside over time. Once constructed, this persisting psychological self serves as an anchor for unique experiences, which are retained easily as long as they become personally meaningful<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.65</NUMEX> A psychological self is not ï¬rmly in place until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. 
2.An <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Autobiographical Narrative</ENAMEX>. Besides a ï¬rm sense of an inner self, autobiographical memory depends on organizing personal experiences in narrative form so they become part of a life story. How do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learn to structure memories as narratives during the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>? Much evidence indicates that they acquire this skill through conversations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.

As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 1 1/2 to 2 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> begin to talk about the past, guided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who prompt them and expand on their fragmented recollections. At <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ï¬rst</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> provide most of the content and structure of the story. But very soon, childrenâ€™s contribution increases, as can be seen in this short excerpt of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> talking with her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 3-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> about a recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX> celebration:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child:â</ENAMEX>€‚Once on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> was over and I had a princess dress on me.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>: You had a princess dress on? Did you get any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX>? Did you go door to door? What happened?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child</ENAMEX>: We went treating.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>: You went treating! And who took you?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child</ENAMEX>: Andreaâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> took us. And my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> . . . and we brought a pumpkin too.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>: What did you do with the pumpkin?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child</ENAMEX>: We lighted it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>: What did it look like? Was it scary?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh-huh</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dad</ENAMEX> made cuts in it with a razor. He made a face too. That was funny<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.66</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> provides details and, by asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œwhoâ€</ENAMEX> and â€œwhat,â€ encourages her young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> to enrich the narrative. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> participate in these dialogues, they adopt the narrative thinking generated in them and retain many details about past events, made personally meaningful in the context of parentâ€“child conversation.
Observations of parentâ€“child <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> vary in how they engage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in narrative talk. Some, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> in the conversation just given, use an elaborative style, in which they pose many, varied questions; add information by building on childrenâ€™s statements; and volunteer their own evaluations of events, as in â€œWas it scary?â€ Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> use a repetitive style. Appearing rushed, impatient, and inattentive to the childâ€™s comments, they contribute little information and ask the same short-answer questions over and over: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œDo you remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX>?â€ â€œWhat costume did you wear<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">?â€ â</ENAMEX>€œDo you remember what you wore?â€ The elaborative style is considerably better at fostering preschoolersâ€™ narrative skill, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2- and 3-year-olds</TIMEX> who experience it produce more coherent and detailed personal stories when followed up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 2 years later</TIMEX>.67
Childrenâ€™s conversations with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">elaborative</TIMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> increase in complexity as language development proceeds, creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of proximal development in which narrative competence expands. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 3 and 6 years</TIMEX>, childrenâ€™s descriptions of special, one-time eventsâ€”a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> excursion, a grandparentâ€™s visit, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a ï¬rst</NUMEX> trip to the dentistâ€”become better organized and more elaborate. Spurred by adult prompting, older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> also add more background <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">informationâ€”â€œwhenâ€</ENAMEX> and â€œwhereâ€ the event took place and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œwhoâ€</ENAMEX> was present. By including these details, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> place personally signiï¬cant experiences in the larger context of their lives. 
Finally, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4 and 6 years of age</TIMEX>, evaluative statements, which help to clarify â€œwhyâ€ an event is personally meaningful, become common. Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> more often embellish their descriptions with modiï¬ers, such as â€œMy mask was uglyâ€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œThe kite ï¬‚ew high.â€ At times, they even add drama by intensifying these expressions, as in â€œThe kite ï¬‚ew very, very highâ€ and â€œGrandma ate a huge bowl of oatmeal for breakfast<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">!â€</ENAMEX> And like the autobiographical and everyday narratives that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> generate, childrenâ€™s narratives increasingly focus on peopleâ€™s internal statesâ€”their desires, feelings, and beliefs: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œShe</ENAMEX> wanted it so muchâ€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œI felt bad.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œ 68 Furthermore</ENAMEX>, the richness of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-year</TIMEX>-oldsâ€™ evaluative remarks can be predicted from their motherâ€™s evaluative statements in an adultâ€“child conversation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years earlier69â€”a</TIMEX> ï¬nding that underscores, once again, parentsâ€™ vital role in creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> for narrative development. 
In sum, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> share memories, mark them as personally meaningful, and begin to create their life story, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to whom they are close become vigorous contributors to their self-constructions. From the beginning, the childâ€™s sense of self is not isolated, encapsulated inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. Rather, it is shaped by and situated in childrenâ€™s everyday social experiencesâ€”in the dialogues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and other cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, preschools, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
Acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Beliefs and Values</ENAMEX>. Through dialogues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> derives not just a self, but a self imbued with culture. The stories, both real and ï¬ctional, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> relate to or jointly construct with young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are laced with cultural beliefs and values. They have profound socializing implications<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.70</NUMEX>
At times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> stories that carry important self-relevant lessons. For example, recently I listened in as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> waited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">foyer</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish New Year</TIMEX> service to begin. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> wove an animated tale about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaim</ENAMEX>, who had great diculty remaining quiet during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday</TIMEX> service. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Chaim</ENAMEX> had a brand new whistle in his back pocket, and he badly wanted to play it. With great eort, he resisted, turning and twisting in his seat until, ï¬nally, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabbi</ENAMEX> blew the shofar (ceremonial ramâ€™s horn), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaim</ENAMEX> could bear it no longer! <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A moment</TIMEX> later, the clear, high-pitched sound of the whistle could be heard over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rabbiâ€™s ï¬nal</ENAMEX> shofar blast. Everyone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> turned toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chaim</ENAMEX>, who cringed with embarrassment. But much to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaimâ</ENAMEX>€™s surprise, all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">congregants</ENAMEX> cheered and thanked him for making the shofar ritual more beautiful than ever. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaimâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> praised him for sitting quietly, almost to the end of the service.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Five-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> listened to his fatherâ€™s story with rapt attention, asking questions and adding personal comments: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œWhere did Chaim sit?â€ â€œDid</ENAMEX> he (like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX>) bring a book to read<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">?â€ â€œWas Chaim</ENAMEX> allowed to get up and go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom?â€ â</ENAMEX>€œWas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rabbi</ENAMEX> angry at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaim</ENAMEX>?â€ The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">story</ENAMEX> disclosed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> realize a long service is hard for a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> to sit through, but exercising self-restraint and participating in communal rituals bring praise and acceptance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analogies</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> drew between his own life and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaimâ€™s</ENAMEX> suggest that he had (as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> intended) experienced the story from a personal vantage point, identifying with its events and applying them to himself.71 
Systematic research reveals both cultural similarities and dierences in adultâ€“child narratives. In an intensive observational study of daily storytelling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two communitiesâ</TIMEX>€”six middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> neighborhood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicagoâ</ENAMEX>€”Peggy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> and her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">colleagues72</NUMEX> found that preschoolers and their family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> routinely narrated past experiences. Most often, they created joint accounts of pleasurable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX> and family excursionsâ€”birthday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, the fair, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonaldâ</ENAMEX>€™s for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> market, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, and riding on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> also talked about times the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were ill, sad, or frightened. 
In a smaller set of narratives, the topic addressedâ€”either directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or to someone else while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> listenedâ€”was the childâ€™s misbehavior. These stories, more than any others, seemed deliberately aimed at teaching social and moral standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, however, were far more likely to initiate these tales of misdeeds than were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. In fact, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adultsâ</ENAMEX>€™ narratives with or in the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 1/2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> focused on past transgressions, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 7 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narratives</ENAMEX> did<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.73</NUMEX>
Furthermore, interpretations of childrenâ€™s misbehavior diered between the two cultures. Consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucian</ENAMEX> parental obligation, â€œThe deeper the love, the greater the correction,<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€ Chinese mothersâ€™ â€œmisdeedâ€</ENAMEX> stories were much longer than those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> mothersâ€”in fact, the most lengthy and elaborate of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrations</ENAMEX>. Sometimes they occurred right after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> committed a transgression; at other times, they reminded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of earlier improper behavior. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> typically corrected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> repeatedly: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œWhat</ENAMEX> did you say<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">?â€ â€œSo</ENAMEX>, what would you say?â€ â€œThen how would <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> have reacted?â€ And in line with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Confucian</ENAMEX> reliance on formal stories with moral lessons, these informal narratives often ended with direct teaching of how to act: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œSaying dirty words is not good,â€ and (after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> agreed) an expression of aectionâ€”a hug, a tender touch.
In instances in which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> stories referred to young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">childrenâ€™s misbehavior</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> frequently deemphasized these acts, attributing them to the childâ€™s spunk and assertiveness. This does not mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> seldom instruct their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in social and moral rules. They often do so, largely through guiding remarks that accompany childrenâ€™s ongoing actions, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œDonâ</ENAMEX>€™t grab. Share the toy.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ â€œHold</ENAMEX> hands when crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ â€œYou</ENAMEX> hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX>. Say youâ€™re sorry.â€
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> notes, the way social and moral lessons are integrated into narratives aects childrenâ€™s frameworks for judging themselves and interpreting their social experiences. Through everyday stories, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> personalized moral lessons and stressed obligations to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority ï¬gures</ENAMEX>. They also reminded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the impact of their transgressions on othersâ€”an element dramatically illustrated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motherâ€™s</ENAMEX> recounting of her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1/2</NUMEX>-year-oldâ€™s disruption of his older sisterâ€™s music lesson: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œAi</ENAMEX>, you made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mama</ENAMEX> lose face. . . . I wanted to dig my head into the ground. Right? [Child smiles, shakes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>]â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">€74</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> narratives rarely dwelt on misdeeds and, at times, even recast childrenâ€™s oenses as strengthsâ€”as indicative of quick thinking and an active, spirited disposition. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> describes the generally high self-control the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> displayedâ€”listening attentively to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> and complying without reminders. For example, even at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 2</TIMEX>, they waited patiently to open a small gift until a guest had departedâ€”proper etiquette in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> culture. Of course, this does not mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> ought to change their child-oriented narratives to be just like those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>. The socializing impact of a particular narrative style is strengthened by its consistency with a familyâ€™s and communityâ€™s way of life. Also, the narrative variations we have considered tap only a small slice of cultural diversity in adultâ€“child storytelling. The most important lesson we can take from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millerâ</ENAMEX>€™s provocative ï¬ndings is that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> take time to construct narratives with and about the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, they create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> that spurs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to weave moral and social rules into their self-deï¬nitions and to behave accordingly.
Understanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mental Beings</ENAMEX>. We have seen that talking about mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is a major focus of narrative conversation. In narrative, we express the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œfolk psychologyâ€</ENAMEX> of our cultureâ€”our deeply ingrained assumptions about human desires, emotions, and beliefs, and our judgments of certain ones as more acceptable than others. Indeed, violations of our folk psychology are a major impetus for engaging in narrative<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.75</NUMEX> Through conversing with others, we try to make puzzling events and behaviors understandable.
Because peopleâ€™s desires, feelings, and beliefs often dier, conversations are full of social negotiationsâ€”attempts to reconcile dierent versions of reality. Recall how I suggested to my distraught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that her daughterâ€™s breakup with her ï¬ancÃ© might have been defensible, given problems in the relationship and the daughterâ€™s willingness to compensate the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> for his monetary losses. Similarly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-year-old</TIMEX> who says that the sun disappearing below the horizon is â€œsleepyâ€ is likely to receive an alternative explanation. And as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> recount the misdeeds of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> gain access to othersâ€™ evaluations of their egocentric, inconsiderate acts. 
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Bruner</ENAMEX>, learning to negotiate diering viewpoints through narrative is a crowning achievement of human development<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.76</NUMEX> Conversations about personal experiences are prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of social stability. When out-of-the-ordinary events occur and we experience clashing views, we often look for a good listenerâ€”a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> or a loved one we can talk to. By collaborating with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in conversation, we talk out our perspective, seek our partnerâ€™s view, search for meaning in seemingly chaotic events, and try to reconstruct a comprehensible world. In these conversations, we may not agree with our partnerâ€™s point of view, but we usually acknowledge that we comprehend and appreciate itâ€”and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> generally does the same. 
By joining in conversation and listening to the narrative dialogues of others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> develop an understanding of their own and othersâ€™ rich mental lives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> with a good grasp of mental life can detect the likely inner causes of another personâ€™s behavior and use that information to anticipate what that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> might do next. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are also more adept at empathizingâ€”reading othersâ€™ emotions and vicariously experiencing themâ€”a response that increases the chances that they will react with sympathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> and help others in need<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.77</NUMEX> As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as 3 to 5 years of age</TIMEX>, emotion knowledgeâ€”awareness of the circumstances that prompt dierent emotional reactions and the social consequences of expressing oneâ€™s feelingsâ€”is related to friendly considerate behavior, willingness to make amends after harming another, and peer acceptance<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.78</NUMEX>
Research veriï¬es that the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> talk about inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, the greater childrenâ€™s knowledge of them. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who frequently label and explain emotions have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> who use more emotion words in conversation. Maternal prompting of emotional thoughts (â€œWhat makes him afraid?â€) is a good predictor of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-year</TIMEX>-oldsâ€™ emotion language. Later in the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, explanations (â€œHeâ€™s sad because his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> ran awayâ€) are more predictive<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.79</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Consistent with Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s concept of the â€œzone,â€ sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> adjust the way they talk about emotions to ï¬t childrenâ€™s increasing competence. And in line with what we have said about narrative as a vital context for negotiating diering viewpoints, discussions in which family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> disagree about feelings seem particularly helpful in prompting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to step back from the experience of emotion and reï¬‚ect on its causes and consequences<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>
Attaining a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtle Grasp of Mental Life</ENAMEX>. Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 3 to 4</TIMEX>, childrenâ€™s understanding of mental life undergoes a profound transformation. Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> realize that peopleâ€™s beliefs, not just their desires, aect their behavior. This advance is apparent in childrenâ€™s awareness that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can hold false beliefs. 81 To test for a childâ€™s grasp of false belief, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> present situations like this one: <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Show</ENAMEX> a child <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small closed boxes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a familiar Band-Aid box and the other a plain, unmarked box. Then say, â€œPick the box that you think has the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Band-Aids</ENAMEX> in it.â€ Almost always, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> pick the marked container. Next, ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to look inside both boxes; when she does, contrary to her own belief, she will ï¬nd that the marked one is empty and the unmarked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Band-Aids</ENAMEX>. Finally, introduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to a hand puppet and explain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œHereâ€™s Pam</ENAMEX>. She has a cut, see? Where do you think sheâ€™ll look for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Band-Aids</ENAMEX>? Why would she look in there?â€ Only a handful of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year-olds</TIMEX> but many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-olds</TIMEX> can explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pam</ENAMEX> would look in the marked box: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œBecause she thinks thereâ<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">€™s Band-Aids</ENAMEX> in it, but there arenâ€™t any.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€82</ENAMEX>
Mastery of false belief shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> regard beliefs as interpretations, not just reï¬‚ections, of reality. It marks the transition toward a more complex, active view of the mind, which will ï¬‚ourish over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few yearsâ</TIMEX>€”the realization that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can engage in a great many inner activities, from concentrating, remembering, and understanding to guessing, comparing, and inferring<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.83</NUMEX> Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 4</TIMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> assume that physical experience determines mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">experienceâ€”that</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Band-Aids</ENAMEX> are in the unmarked box, everyone will just know where they are. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> who grasp false belief recognize that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can, on the basis of prior knowledge and experience, interpret the same event dierentlyâ€”an understanding that is invaluable for social life. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who are good at detecting othersâ€™ points of view are better at thinking of eective ways to handle dicult social situations<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.84</NUMEX> Rather than just asserting their own desires, they try friendly persuasion. Or they suggest that a conï¬‚ict be solved by creating new, mutual goals.
Like emotion knowledge, preschoolersâ€™ grasp of false belief grows out of conversations that touch on the mental lives of others. Without those conversations, this level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> is slow to develop. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">JunÃ­n Quechua</ENAMEX> language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX> highlands is unique in lacking words that describe mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œthinkâ€ and â€œbelieve</ENAMEX>,â€ so <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Quechua</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> refer to mentality indirectly. For example, they use the phrase, â€œWhat would he say?â€ in place of, â€œWhat would he think?â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JunÃ­n Quechua</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have diculty with false-belief tasks for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> have mastered them<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, clear evidence exists that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> who frequently interact with more competent cultural membersâ€”parents, extended family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, and older <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">peersâ€”are</NUMEX> advanced in false-belief reasoning<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.86</NUMEX> These social encounters oer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> many opportunities to hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> refer to their own mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and those of others and, therefore, to observe dierent points of view. When <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3- and 4-year-olds</TIMEX> use their newfound capacity to talk about mental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> during play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, their understanding of false belief improves further<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.87</NUMEX> 
Finally, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> participate in narratives and listen to those of others, they acquire culturally accepted ways for negotiating clashing viewpoints. This equips them with skills for engaging in conversation without confrontation and persistent conï¬‚ictâ€”competencies that are crucial for sustaining warm, pleasurable social relationships. Gratifying social ties, in turn, serve as vital contexts for further cognitive and social development. 
Preparing for Literacy. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> hope that during the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that prepare them to read and write in elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. This interest in literacy is well founded. Reading and writing are not just crucial for success in academic endeavors and later life. They are thoroughfares to vast realms of knowledge, enjoyable leisure pursuits, and contact with others at a distanceâ€”even in dierent historical time periods. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can read and write, they can explore the insights of countless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> and partake in their rich array of experiences. With those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, they can forge highly varied and vastly expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œzonesâ€</ENAMEX> for learning.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> can become competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> without being trained, pushed, or goaded into literacy learning in early childhood. As we saw <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, preschools and kindergartens that emphasize drill on academic skills are detrimental. This way of teaching induces inattentiveness, restlessness, disengagement from challenging activities, and poorer achievement during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ï¬rst few years</TIMEX> of elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who are enthusiastic and self-conï¬dent about learning and who achieve at their best in the early grades have acquired literacy-relevant knowledge informallyâ€”through exposure to books and other reading materials at home, in preschool, and in child-care environments; through observing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> reading and writing in everyday life; and especially, through narrative conversation. 
Literacy-related behaviors emerge in these contexts; consequently, early childhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> refer to preschool competencies that lay the foundation for reading and writing as emergent literacy. Indeed, no clear dividing line exists between prereading and reading. As literacy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover Whitehurst</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Lonigan</ENAMEX> put it, â€œReading, writing, and oral language develop concurrently and interdependently from an early age from childrenâ€™s exposure to interactions in social contexts in which literacy is a component, and in the absence of formal instruction.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€88</ENAMEX>
Research consistently demonstrates that language development in early childhood is strongly related to later reading competenceâ€”and to academic achievement in general during elementary school<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.89</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, both language progress and an array of emergent-literacy skills can be predicted by the sheer amount of verbal interaction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ï¬rst few years</TIMEX> of lifeâ€”a relationship that holds for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of all socioeconomic levels. Conversations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are especially powerful contributors to early childhood language proï¬ciency and, in turn, to literacy development<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.90</NUMEX>
A strong language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> is vital for becoming literate because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> read to extract meaning. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> can more easily derive meaning from the printed page when their vocabularies are large and they have come to think in ways that resemble the narrative styles on which the large majority of written texts are based. By repeatedly listening to and participating in narrative conversation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> develop mental scripts for the way narratives are typically organized. Then, when they start to read, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of text material readily makes sense to them, and they extract meaning more easily. 
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the clearest indicators of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ</ENAMEX>€™s understanding of stories, and other prereading skills, is the extent to which they can give elaborate, detailed accounts of past events<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> sharpen this competency through conversing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, who add information, ask questions, and prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to increase the sophistication of their descriptions and explanationsâ€”in essence, who use an elaborative style of narrative talk. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehurst</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to integrate the elaborative narrative style into shared adultâ€“child storybook reading, an approach called dialogic reading<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.92</NUMEX> 
Typically, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> reads while a child listensâ€”a format that is beneï¬cial to early literacy development93 but that cannot guarantee the childâ€™s attention, involvement, and comprehension. In dialogic reading, the adult encourages the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in the narrative, even a storyteller. Using books with pictures that convey a story line but that have limited text so the adult is less likely to revert to straight reading, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> has the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> relate much of the story. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> assumes the role of an active listenerâ€”querying, encouraging, and expanding on what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> has to say. As in other narrative talk, the adult increases the complexity of his or her questioning to ï¬t the childâ€™s language progress. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2- and 3-year-olds</TIMEX>, questions focus mostly on describing events, actions, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4- and 5-year-olds</TIMEX>, questions more often address narrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> (â€œWhat happens next<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">?â€ â€œHow</ENAMEX> does the story end?â€); analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> (â€œWhy did the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> want a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">teddy bear?â€</ENAMEX>); and connections between the book and the childâ€™s everyday life (â€œHave you ever seen a ï¬re engine on its way to a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ï¬re?â€</ENAMEX>). 
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> use dialogic reading consistently over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> show gains in language development, print knowledge, and writing progress that are still present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months to a year later</TIMEX>.94 Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> dier widely in intrinsic interest in reading activities, shared reading can spark the interest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who seldom seek out literacy-related pursuits on their own. Aspects of adult behaviorâ€”warmth, dramatic quality, and attempts to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to participate activelyâ€”heighten childrenâ€™s interest and involvement in reading<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.95</NUMEX> An interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is more likely to request shared reading times, notice features of print that are important for reading, ask questions about them, and (later on) read on his or her own. 
As older preschoolers begin to attend to features of print, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> can combine shared book reading with scaolding of childrenâ€™s knowledge of letter names, letterâ€“sound correspondences, and print conventions (for example, that books are read from left to right and top to bottom of the page, that spaces are used to separate words and periods to end sentences). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> can also assist young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as they become interested in writing by responding positively to their writing-like creations and helping them attain their writing goals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> activities and playâ€”printing their name or a message, making a storybook, or adding items to a shopping list. Along with general language and narrative competencies, relaxed informal teaching of basic reading and writing skillsâ€”in limited doses and without excessive feedback about right and wrongâ€”fosters emergent literacy and aids the process of learning to read and write after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> begin school<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.96</NUMEX> 
In sum, adultâ€“child conversationâ€”in book-reading and other contextsâ€”is the best way to prime young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> for becoming interested, accomplished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shared</ENAMEX> reading with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> is particularly inï¬‚uentialâ€”more so than reading with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. In one study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonigan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehurst</ENAMEX> compared shared reading with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> at preschool, shared reading with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> at home, and a combined condition. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> gained in oral language skills compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> receiving no intervention. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> experiencing home reading improved the most<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> seem to be in the best position to read to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> often and to tailor their dialogues to the childâ€™s interests and abilities.

Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contexts</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Adultâ€“Child Engagement</ENAMEX> 

When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend time together, opportunities for scaolding of new skills and for conversation are nearly limitless. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> who capitalize on these moments ensure that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> internalize the history, values, knowledge, skills, habits, practices, and understandings of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. We have already seen how academically related tasks, family celebrations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> outings, and adultâ€“child storybook reading are excellent focal points for adultâ€“child engagement. Make-believe play is yet another. Indeed, joint participation in make-believe with more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> is so important for development during early childhood that I devote an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> to it. Other vital contexts for adultâ€“child engagement include everyday routines and duties, mealtimes, and television viewing. Each of these settings has distinct and highly signiï¬cant developmental beneï¬ts, as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> take time to enter into them and mentally connect with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. 

everyday routines and duties.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€‚â€‚By</ENAMEX> participating in everyday routines and duties at home and in preschool, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> develop a sense of responsible participation in family and community life. At the same time, they acquire practical skills and a wealth of knowledge about their physical and social surroundings. The parent always in a hurryâ€”who says, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> desires involvement, â€œThere isnâ€™t time,â€ or who fails to insist that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> join in household tasks in keeping with his or her capacityâ€”severely limits the childâ€™s learning.
In preindustrial times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spent most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their day</TIMEX> alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> as they went about housekeeping and earning a livelihood. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> became deeply familiar with adultsâ€™ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> activities, picking up many skills through observation and direct participation. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recall John Iseâ</ENAMEX>€™s account of family life on a rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homestead</ENAMEX>, described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX>.) Greater parentâ€“child togetherness throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> is also common in tribal and village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> spend less time supporting childrenâ€™s learning through verbal scaolding because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have so many opportunities to observe and participate directly in the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.98
Because ï¬ne-tuned scaolding is seldom required, adultâ€“child participation in everyday routines and dutiesâ€”preparing a meal, washing dishes, raking and bagging leaves in the garden, buying groceriesâ€”oers extra time for conversation, with all its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant beneï¬ts</ENAMEX>. In addition, many informal learning opportunities arise that will serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> well when they get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. An astute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> I observed in the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> had her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ricky</ENAMEX>, reach for items on the shelf and put them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX>. When at the checkout counter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky</ENAMEX> became restless and whiny, his mother handed him her credit card and directed him to watch closely for the moment the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> would need it. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> turned toward the register, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> pointed out how the price of each item appeared on a screen. Ricky alternately named the numbers he recognized and counted items as they passed through the checkout. Awed by the responsibility of handing over the credit card, a task he had seen performed only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricky</ENAMEX> complied eagerlyâ€”and also saw numerical concepts in action! Although grocery shopping with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricky</ENAMEX> might take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 15 minutes</TIMEX> longer than otherwise, it has wide-ranging beneï¬ts for his development.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> well know, are not always eager to perform chores that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> set for them. But they are more willing when they see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> engaged in those duties, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> explain why itâ€™s fair that everyone help, and when their relationship with those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> is warm and gratifying<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.99</NUMEX> These communicative ingredients motivate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to join in with a cooperative spirit, which demonstrates that they have moved beyond the adultâ€™s position to one of their ownâ€”that is, internalized social norms with conviction<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.100</NUMEX> In doing so, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> demonstrate once again their strong desire to become part of cultural life.

mealtime conversations.<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€‚â€‚Mealtimesâ€”usually dinnerâ</ENAMEX>€”are special social contexts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in complex societies. They are among the few occasions in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> regularly gather after spending most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> apart and in which the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> activity is relating to one another. Hence, mealtime talk overï¬‚ows with opportunities for socialization. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mealtimes</ENAMEX> and similar occasions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> togetherness open special conversational doors. Because all family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are present, dinner talk can convey to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> a sense of family coherence and identity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.101</NUMEX> Most of us can still recapture the stories our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> told us, in which social and moral lessons were powerful and abundant. Here is one my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> told me, recalled in vivid detail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a half century</TIMEX> later: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œOnce</ENAMEX>, when your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 years old</TIMEX>, he came home weeping, his hands all bloody from working in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, your great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, wiped away his tears and said, â€˜Donâ€™t cry, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> youâ€™ll own that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>.â€™ And by the time he was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>, he did.â€
Dinnertime recaps of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> events also permit todayâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, isolated from the adult world of real work, to gain access to their parentsâ€™ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> lives. I learned much about my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fatherâ€™s</ENAMEX> experiences as a retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX> through stories he related to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dinnertime: â€œSoï¬e</ENAMEX>, youâ€™ll never believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> who came into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> today. She complained so vehemently about a perfectly correct bill that it took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">escort her</ENAMEX> to the door.â€ 
Family mealtime conversations, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> participate directly or listen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> of others, also provide special instruction in discussion skills, since they are among the few routine occasions in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are permitted to enter an adult conversational world<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.102</NUMEX> When meals are shared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can model and teach cultural rules regulating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conversationâ</ENAMEX>€”appropriate topics and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">politeness (â€œWe donâ€™t</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is disgusting at the tableâ€) and subtle conversational strategies that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> become proï¬cient at only after much practice, such as how to enter a conversation and link with other participantsâ€™ statements.
Finally, and perhaps most important, mealtimes allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to enter into their childrenâ€™s world and hear about the many facets of their lives, ranging from what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> did at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> to reï¬‚ections on how to solve peer or sibling problems<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.103</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consequently</ENAMEX>, they serve to reinforce not just socialization but parental caring and support. The numerous beneï¬ts of this rich communal context are lost when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> mealtime rituals diminish or disintegrate into frequent eating on the run or split adultâ€“child <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX>. 
The importance of family mealtimes is underscored by the fact that the most widely used research instrument for assessing the quality of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ</ENAMEX>€™s home environments asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> eats <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">meal a day</TIMEX> with a parent<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.104</NUMEX> Scores on that instrument consistently predict early childhood mental development, no matter what the childâ€™s socioeconomic or ethnic background<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.105</NUMEX>

television viewing.<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€‚â€‚In Chapter 1</ENAMEX>, I noted that according to current survey ï¬ndings, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> spend over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of their free timeâ€”about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 hours</TIMEX> per weekâ€”watching TV. Estimates for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are even more ominous. Regular TV viewing typically begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2 and 3 years of age</TIMEX>, consuming <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10.5 hours</TIMEX> per week, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 13 percent</NUMEX> of the childâ€™s waking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. It rises steadily over early childhood until it reaches an average of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28 hours</TIMEX> per week for school-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 percent</NUMEX> of the childâ€™s waking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours.106</TIMEX> When we consider how much the set is on during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">school holidays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> vacations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend more time watching TV than they do in any other waking activity, including going to school and interacting with family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. 
These statistics are averages; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> dier in their attraction to television. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who watch a lot of TV tend to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who do the same. Excessive TV viewing is associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and peer diculties, poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> achievement, and serious health concernsâ€”speciï¬cally, overweight and obesity as a result of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of being sedentary and eating high-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat snacks</ENAMEX> while viewing<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.107</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> with stressful, unhappy lives often escape into television, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> may do so as well.
It is crucial that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> exercise their gatekeeper role with respect to TV, limiting how much and what young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> watchâ€”to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX> to an hour-and-a-half a day and to programs that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-appropriate and informative and that teach positive social attitudes and behaviors. In addition, as much as possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> should watch with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and engage in joint conversation about televised information, helping them understand what they see. Parental oversight and involvement in childrenâ€™s TV viewing are essential for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons. 
First, preschoolers easily misunderstand televised material. For example, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 2 and 3</TIMEX>, they do not discriminate TV images from real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>; they say a bowl of popcorn on TV would spill if the set were turned upside down!<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX> When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> believes that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, objects, and events on TV are authentic, violenceâ€”so pervasive on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American TVâ</ENAMEX>€”becomes particularly terrifying. Although by age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> know that not all TV programming is real, they judge TV reality according to whether the images resemble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in everyday life. Not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 8</TIMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> fully grasp the unreality of TV ï¬ctionâ€”that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> do not retain their roles outside the TV show<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.109</NUMEX> 
Furthermore, prior to this age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have diculty inferring charactersâ€™ motives and connecting contradictory TV scenes into a coherent story line. They cannot appreciate why a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> who at ï¬rst seemed like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œgood guyâ</ENAMEX>€ but later behaves aggressively is really a â€œbad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>.â€ They evaluate such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and their actions much too favorably<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.110</NUMEX> For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon Purdie</ENAMEX> showed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">second graders</ENAMEX> a complex dramatic program in which an accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kidnapper</ENAMEX>, who had at ï¬rst appeared friendly, tried to shoot a prosecution <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> and got arrested during the attempt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who failed to grasp the kidnapperâ€™s motive and the reason for the arrest judged him to be â€œgood,â€ not â€œbad.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€111</ENAMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, weak government regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> TV means that without parental controls, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child viewers</ENAMEX> are exposed repeatedly to antisocial attitudes and behaviors. The average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> ï¬nishing elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> has seen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> televised violent acts that provide â€œan extensive how-to course in aggression.â<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">€112â</NUMEX>€‚Television also hardens <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to violence, making them more willing to tolerate it in others<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.113</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, although educational programming for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is highly sensitive to issues of equity and diversity, entertainment programming often conveys ethnic and gender stereotypesâ€”minorities as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villains</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of violence and in subservient roles; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> as dominant, powerful, and competent and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> as attractive, emotional, and submissive. The more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> view, the more likely they are to endorse such stereotypes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">114 Finally</ENAMEX>, as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are aware, television advertising manipulates childrenâ€™s beliefs and preferences. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can distinguish a TV program from a commercial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as age 3</TIMEX>, below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 8</TIMEX> they seldom grasp the selling purpose of the ads<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.115</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rather</ENAMEX>, they think that commercials are well-intentioned eorts to be helpful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX>.
These worrisome ï¬ndings are not an inherent part of the TV medium. Instead, they result from the way it is used in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture. In actuality, television has as much potential for good as it does for ill. For example, TV content depicting acts of cooperating, helping, and comforting encourages these behaviors in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.116</NUMEX> But most of the time, programs mix benevolent and hostile intentions in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are riveted by a characterâ€™s aggression and miss the caring message. Television promotes positive social behavior in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> only when it is free of violent content<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.117</NUMEX>
Despite widespread public concern about the impact of TV on childrenâ€™s development, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do little to regulate or guide their childrenâ€™s viewing. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do make an eort, preschoolers watch less TV, ï¬nd educational programs more appealing, and more often view shows with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.118 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parentâ€“child</ENAMEX> co-viewing creates conditions in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> can raise questions about the realism of televised information, assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in making sense of the story line, and express disapproval of negative on-screen behavior and commercial messages, thereby teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to evaluate TV content rather than to accept it uncritically.
Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who are warm, communicative, and ï¬rm but appropriate in their expectations have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who are less drawn to TV, particularly violent TV<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.119</NUMEX> Very likely, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> set an example through their own TV viewing, watch with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> whenever they can, and use TV programs in constructive ways, helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> move away from the set into worthwhile activities. A program about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, for example, might spark a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> for books about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, or new ways of observing and caring for the family pet. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> who intervene in their childâ€™s TV viewing so it is in keeping with the â€œzoneâ€ transform the TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> from a negative to a positive force in the childâ€™s mental life, and they promote favorable cognitive and social development in many other ways as well. 


dialogues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>: larger implications

Compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three generations ago</TIMEX>, contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> less often engage in the development-enhancing, joint activities discussed throughout this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, long before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> became preoccupied with the â€œtime bind,â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urie Bronfenbrenner</ENAMEX> reï¬‚ected that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> â€œused to be brought up by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â</ENAMEX>€120 Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronfenbrenner</ENAMEX> noted, continues to have primary responsibility for childrenâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> development, it lacks the strength needed to do the job because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> no longer spend enough time together. Ours is a split societyâ€”adults in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> world, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in another. Too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have separate adultâ€“child living areas, each equipped with its own TV and other leisure pursuits so that parentâ€“child dialogues seldom take place. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend most of their time apart, the result is a profound dampening of parentsâ€™ socializing power. 
In the past, extended family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in the neighborhood more readily stepped in when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, for one reason or another, could not invest enough time in their childrenâ€™s lives. Today, neighborhood experiences are much more restricted. Housing enclaves where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> know each other well and interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are available to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œmind childrenâ€™s businessâ€</ENAMEX> are rare. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who live close to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> beneï¬t greatly, enjoying aectionate, playful relationships with them at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early ages</TIMEX> and looking to them for information, role models, family history, and values later on. But greater family mobility means that more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> live a considerable distance from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>. And parental divorce, which will aect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 to 60 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the current decade</TIMEX>,121 lessens contact with the noncustodial parentâ€™s extended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. In childhood, physical distance makes for a psychologically distant relationship.
Remove <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> from active participation in the lives of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and the vacuum may be ï¬lled by unsupervised and ill-behaved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> and the moral vagaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> TV fare. Continued disengagement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> from childrenâ€™s lives, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronfenbrenner</ENAMEX> prophesied, will result in greater alienation, indierence, antagonism, and violence on the part of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from all sectors of societyâ€”a prediction that came to pass in the form of rapidly escalating youth crime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the 1970s and 1990s</TIMEX>, with an increasing number of oenders from privileged homes<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.122</NUMEX> 
As media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> try to make sense of the most heinous of these acts, including the recent spate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and neighborhood murders and maimings, parental retreat from a troubled childâ€™s life almost invariably surfaces as a contributing factor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> often appear to be good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, having provided their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with material comforts and having responded with anguish, remorse, and attempts to do the right thing in the face of their childâ€™s previous and current grievous behavior. But the cases suggest that stepping in only in at times of crisis cannot compensate for providing the ongoing togetherness and haven of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Such togetherness aects a childâ€™s development in countless ways, even through what appear to be triï¬‚ing pursuitsâ€”help with homework; outings to the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>; dinnertime conversations; discussions of exciting or scary TV shows; and bedtime stories. Yet these are the key experiences of childhood, through which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> appropriate mental tools from more capable and discerning social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, become enculturated and, thereby, humanâ€”intelligent, responsible, and caring. 
Of course, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> with preoccupied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do not become antisocial and violent. Yet over and over, commentary in the media and in the psychological literature conï¬rms that too many of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> are disaected in less intense waysâ€”self-absorbed, disgruntled, and lacking a clear sense of direction and purpose. In the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Damon</ENAMEX>, they are demoralized<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,123</NUMEX> a term that suggests a break with their social world, a deï¬ciency in internalization of worthwhile values and goals. 
A provocative question is whether a craving for connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and community is at the heart of the ï¬‚oundering of many of todayâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>, manifested in academic problems, poor peer relationships, low self-esteem, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>, angry, acting-out behavior, andâ€”with the arrival of young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">adulthoodâ€”inability</ENAMEX> to make vocational commitments, attain ï¬nancial independence, and forge healthy intimate relationships. Research documents that these diculties are magniï¬ed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to threefold in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> who have been exposed to marital discord and divorce<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,124</NUMEX> circumstances in which parentsâ€”at odds with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> anotherâ€”all too often are diverted from investing in their childrenâ€™s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> lives. 
Yet a certain number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX>, despite exposure to severe family adversity, escape these diculties and adjust well. A common element in the lives of such resilient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX>, as I noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX>, is an unusually warm, positive relationship with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or a close tie with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> outside the immediate family<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.125</NUMEX> What happens within these alternative relationships that shields the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> from problems or restores eective functioning? Although little systematic evidence exists on the precise ingredients of such ties, I recently became familiar with the bond forged between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21-year-old</TIMEX> college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, and her <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aunt Eva</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Charlie</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of my university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>. Hannahâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> divorced when she was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> and her older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>. Hannah related the story of her childhood and the genesis of her relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eva</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>, who oered insights as well. What they had to say is enlightening. 
â€œI canâ€™t remember much family togetherness when I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Hannah</ENAMEX> remarked. â€œOur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> couldnâ€™t talk things out with each other, and they rarely talked things out with us. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> and me to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girl Scouts</ENAMEX>, swimming, piano, and other lessons. We enjoyed the activities and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> we made, but they couldnâ€™t compensate for what was missing: warm, family time. We almost never sat down to a meal together or went places together; we each went our own way. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> started going o on vacations by himself when holidays rolled around, so family get-togethers were rare. 
â€œWhen our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> split up, we moved with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> worked all week, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>, and most evenings. She had to get a career going so thereâ€™d be money to live on and to send us to college. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> hung out with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the neighborhood. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A couple of times a week</TIMEX>, she had dinner and went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with them. Looking back, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iâ€™d</ENAMEX> say they were her substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>; she â€˜adoptedâ€™ them, and they â€˜adoptedâ€™ her. I was too young to go o on my own that way. When I didnâ€™t have after-school activities, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> insisted that I come home and do chores and homework. Sometimes I got to go to a friendâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to play, but many <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> Iâ€™d open a can of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spaghetti</ENAMEX> and have dinner by myself. I spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> daydreaming and looking at old pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX>, and me.â€
On ï¬nishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> chose a religiously aliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> of the same denomination as that of her â€œalternativeâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The year</TIMEX> after her college graduation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> married a devout <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmate</ENAMEX>, entering into a culture in which family life was pivotal. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six years later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah</ENAMEX> started college, but for her the road to maturity was rough. She had diculty concentrating, earned uneven grades, and accumulated so many incompletes in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her â€œunï¬nished business.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€ Frustrated with Hannahâ</ENAMEX>€™s undirectedness, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> withdrew ï¬nancial support and insisted that she get a job. Hannahâ€™s full-time waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œI</ENAMEX> was at sea,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Hannah</ENAMEX> recalled. â€œI didnâ€™t have any conï¬dence in myself, and I didnâ€™t think I could do anything. So I started visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aunt Eva</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Charlie</ENAMEX>, who lived <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> away.â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œWe hadnâ€™t</ENAMEX> known <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah</ENAMEX> well while she was growing up,â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eva</ENAMEX> continued, â€œso we were surprised but delighted when she started coming on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. It didnâ€™t matter what we were doingâ€”birthday celebrations, dinner with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, outings to movies and plays, shopping excursions, or leisurely breakfasts; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah</ENAMEX> hungered to be part of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. During those times, she asked lots of questions about our work and home lives, and also about her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, especially their early history: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€˜Was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> close to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>?â€™ â€˜Did you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> when they were in college<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">?â€™ â€˜What</ENAMEX> was my parentsâ€™ wedding like?â€™ I described these and many other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> events. We also did our best to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah</ENAMEX> that believing in herself grows out of trying hard, taking risks, and following through. We talked about how important it was for her to return to school, helped her think through a change of major, and advised on time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and study skills.â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hannah</ENAMEX> completed her degree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>. In a letter she wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eva</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> shortly after her graduation, she attributed her turnabout in motivation and self-conï¬dence to the connection, forged through dialogue, with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>:

Thank you for everything you have provided, the time and eort you shared with me and the conï¬dence you showed in me. It deï¬nitely enabled me to relocate all of that within myself <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and even be pleasantly surprised by how each accomplishment facilitates the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. This, and you, are among the greatest gifts I have ever received. The change in my ability to focus on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and the personal rewards have been immense. THANKS<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.126</NUMEX> 

What factors contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hannahâ</ENAMEX>€™s turnabout? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shared</ENAMEX> understanding (intersubjectivity) between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, scaolding of new competencies, narrative conversations prompting a redeï¬nition of self, and joint engagement in culturally meaningful activitiesâ€”the diverse experiences we have considered that create the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of proximal developmentâ€”appear to be at the heart of her success story. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hannahâ</ENAMEX>€™s tale suggests that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> denied these supports can still proï¬t from them later, if such supports are available and they have the fortitude to capitalize on them. But not all young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are as fortunate as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah</ENAMEX>. Some remain profoundly impaired by inadequate adult investment in their childhoods. And even those who fare reasonably well may carry with them inner woundsâ€”a sense of emptiness and regret at having missed self-deï¬ning, conï¬dence-inducing early experiences that cannot, in the ï¬nal analysis, be recaptured.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> asked to reï¬‚ect on the malaise and problematic behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> repeatedly comment that they lack sucient adult guidance and involvement<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.127</NUMEX> We have seen that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> come into the world marvelously prepared to enter into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnerships</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other caregivers. In the course of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, I have had much to say about just how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> can capitalize on childrenâ€™s natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">propensities</ENAMEX>. Vygotskyâ€™s concept of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€ clariï¬es</ENAMEX> for us the meaning of true â€œquality time.â€ What must we do to keep young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the â€œzone,â€ motivated, involved, and ever advancing to new heights? Here is a brief recap of the communicative principles we have considered:

â€¢Forge an adultâ€“child relationship based on shared understanding, or intersubjectivityâ€”one in which the adult strives to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œconnectâ€ with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> by â€œstretching downâ€ to his or her point of view, thereby helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> â€œstretch upâ€ to the adultâ€™s more mature perspective. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intersubjectivity</ENAMEX> is essential for all successful dialogue.
â€¢Oer a scaffold for mastery of tasks that teach culturally valued concepts and skills. Adjust the task to an appropriately challenging level, and tailor teaching and assistance to the childâ€™s changing needs. While supporting the childâ€™s eorts, ask questions and suggest strategies that help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> generate ideas and distance his or her thinking from the immediate features of the task. Turn over responsibility for the task to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> as soon as he or she can master it without assistance. Adultâ€“child collaboration through scaolding promotes self-regulation and independent accomplishment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢Communicate</ENAMEX> with high warmth, using a positive emotional tone and providing explanations and justiï¬cations for your expectations. When adultâ€“child relationships are sympathetic and caring, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> want to acquire skills and behave in ways that preserve those gratifying ties. They are also more willing to work toward goals that are rational and reasonable. Authoritative parenting, which combines the motivating power of warmth with the guidance inherent in scaolding, predicts many aspects of childrenâ€™s competence.
â€¢Engage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in narrative conversation about personal experiences, using an elaborative conversational style that poses many varied questions and that expands on the childâ€™s statements. Through narrative, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> build an autobiographical self permeated with cultural beliefs and values; come to understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have rich mental lives and may view the same events dierently; and acquire negotiation strategies for resolving disputes and getting along with others. Narrative conversation also fosters language development and emergent literacy, which greatly ease the task of learning to read and write when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. 

Through dialogues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> play a formative role in the development of childrenâ€™s self-conceptions, sensitivity to others, cognition, academic knowledge, morality, social skills, and capacity to use language to gain control over thought and behavior. Can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> actually witness young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> undergoing these social-to-psychological transformations? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Letâ€™s</ENAMEX> turn now to a consideration of childrenâ€™s inner mental lives, as manifested in the dialogues they carry on with themselves. In the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, I address a question that has long intrigued <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> and puzzled many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>: Why do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> talk to themselves?
