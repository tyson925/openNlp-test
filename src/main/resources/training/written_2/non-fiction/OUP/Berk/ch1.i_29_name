In my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</TIMEX> of teaching university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development, I have come to know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, many of whom were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> or who became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> soon after completing my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. I also served on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> and advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> for child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, preschools, elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. And my research continually drew me into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX>, where for countless hours I observed and recorded preschool and school-age children‚Äôs activities, social interactions, and solitary behaviors, in hopes of answering central questions about how they learn.
As a byproduct of those experiences, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> repeatedly approached me with concerns about how to foster their child‚Äôs development in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX>. Their fervent questions, at times riddled with doubt and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX>, revealed that creating optimum learning environments for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at home‚Äîand ensuring their access to development-enhancing experiences in child care, preschool, and school‚Äîhave become mounting parental challenges. 
Consider the following problematic situations that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> recently raised with me:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Bob</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 4-year-old</TIMEX>: Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia</ENAMEX>, could recite her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABCs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">count</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 20</TIMEX> by age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1/2</NUMEX>. When we looked for a preschool, many programs appeared to do little more than let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> play, so we chose one with lots of emphasis on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX>. To me, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lydia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs preschool seems like great preparation for kindergarten and Ô¨Årst grade, but <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia</ENAMEX> hates to go. Why is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia</ENAMEX>, who‚Äôs always been an upbeat, curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, so unhappy?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Angela</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 4-year-old</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-year-old</TIMEX>: My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and I have demanding careers and need to bring work home in the evenings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I‚Äôve</ENAMEX> read that it‚Äôs the quality of time we spend with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that‚Äôs important, not the quantity. We try hard to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Victor</ENAMEX> and Jeannine our undivided attention, but they‚Äôre often whiny, demanding, and quarrelsome. Many times we end up sending them to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> or letting them watch TV, just to get some peace after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long day</TIMEX>. What‚Äôs the best way to create quality parent‚Äìchild time?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Talia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 7-year-old</TIMEX>: My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anselmo</ENAMEX>, a Ô¨Årst <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grader</ENAMEX>, constantly asks us to help him with his homework. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> Ô¨Årmly insists that he do it by himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselmo</ENAMEX> tries, but he gets so frustrated and upset that I move in and help, even in the face of opposition from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>. By that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselmo</ENAMEX> is on such a short string that I do most of the assignment for him. Should we be helping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anselmo</ENAMEX> with his homework and, if so, how?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Noah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 2-year-old</TIMEX>: When our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were raising us, they seemed conÔ¨Ådent of their power and inÔ¨Çuence. Recently we read that how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> turn out is mostly written in their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; there‚Äôs little we as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can do about it. Does parenting really matter?


baffled, bewildered parents

Despite being well educated, intent on doing what‚Äôs best for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and enlightened by a vast literature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing advice, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> appear uneasy and unsure of their roles at best, baed and bewildered at worst. As the above sampling of concerns reveals, today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are not just worried about major transitions and traumas, such as the impact of marital breakup or community violence. They agonize over commonplace, recurrent, everyday situations‚Äîwhether intensive preschool academic tutoring is crucial for later success in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, the meaning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúquality time‚Äù</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and whether and how to help their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with homework. At an even more fundamental level, contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have begun to doubt their own ecacy in their children‚Äôs development. Why is this so?
The reasons, I believe, are twofold. First, rapid societal changes have complicated parents‚Äô task, making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing more challenging than in previous generations. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development disseminated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> is increasingly voluminous but at the same time contradictory. It fails to oer a clear, consistent vision of good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing to guide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> decision making and practice. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of parental frustration and confusion. 

Societal Changes

Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades</TIMEX>, external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> impinging on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have transformed parents‚Äô and, therefore, children‚Äôs lives. Overall, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> complain that they have less free time to spend with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witness</ENAMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> survey of a large, representative sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 25 percent</NUMEX> of whom expressed the feeling that the demands of their jobs left them with ‚Äúno time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù2 Compounding</ENAMEX> their worries, employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> must, out of necessity, turn over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Yet once their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are beyond their grasp, they are hardly o the hook! Conscientious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> face an added responsibility: monitoring their child‚Äôs whereabouts and activities, verifying from a distance that their youngster is physically safe, emotionally contented, and constructively engaged. 
Although many societal conditions heighten parents‚Äô struggle to rear psychologically healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are especially pernicious, aecting even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who manage to escape the trials and tribulations of divorce, single parenthood, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stepchildren</ENAMEX>, serious Ô¨Ånancial worries, and other family stresses. The Ô¨Årst is the dire shortage of acceptable child-care options in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is the parental dilemma of ‚Äúnever enough time.‚Äù In view of these diculties, it is little wonder that so many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> express a sense of powerlessness and inadequacy when it comes to aecting their children‚Äôs development. 

the problem of child care.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇIn 1970</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> with pre-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were in the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, a Ô¨Ågure that increased more than twofold, to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62 percent</NUMEX>, by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000.3</NUMEX> An obvious solution to reconciling parents‚Äô employment needs with young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rearing needs is to make high-quality, nonparental care, with characteristics known to promote healthy psychological development, widely available and aordable. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, child care is nationally regulated and liberally funded to ensure that it conforms to standards veriÔ¨Åed by research to foster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">children‚</ENAMEX>Äôs learning, social competence, and emotional security<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> 
Without a nationally regulated and generously subsidized child-care system, formal child care in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is in much shorter supply and considerably more costly for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> than it is in other industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. And as our discussion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 6</ENAMEX> will reveal, on the whole, the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> care‚Äîwhether <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>-based or home-based‚Äîis mediocre to abysmal<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> Indeed, so widespread is poor-quality child care in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have acclimated to it. In a recent survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were enrolled in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> randomly chosen child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 90 percent</NUMEX> believed that their preschoolers‚Äô experiences were far better than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in early childhood development judged those experiences to be<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parents</ENAMEX> seemed unable to distinguish ‚Äúgood‚Äù from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúsubstandard‚Äù care. 

the ‚Äútime bind.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇLike many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX>, who raised the question of quality time, complains of being ‚Äútorn in many directions.‚Äù Often she leaves work in a hurry in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the late afternoon</TIMEX> to pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeannine</ENAMEX> from child care, dashes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victor‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tumbling class or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeannine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs piano lesson, then stops at the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> to pick up something for dinner. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>, walk through their front door, they typically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to the phone or fax machine to take care of unÔ¨Ånished work while trying to quell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Victor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeannine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs hunger and irritability with a frozen dinner popped into the microwave and unlimited access to the TV set. Caught in a ceaseless sprint to reconcile job, marriage, and parenting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> feel drained at the end of the day‚Äîtoo tired to grant their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 or 15 minutes</TIMEX> of focused time. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeannine</ENAMEX> do get their parents‚Äô undivided attention, they are argumentative and unruly, compounding their parents‚Äô fatigue and impatience. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> represent a growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who try to pencil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> into busy schedules, much like a business appointment. They love their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, but they also love and need their work, for personal and Ô¨Ånancial reasons. Hence they Ô¨Ånd themselves in a juggling act between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, with work usually winning out. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX> will be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, they rationalize, but a business deal or a professional achievement, if not capitalized on at the moment, may evaporate. Their logic dovetails with the concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúquality time‚Äù</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. In its commonly accepted meaning, quality time refers to an intense but brief contact. The term is a ready salve for the consciences of conÔ¨Çicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, who squeeze in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few moments</TIMEX> with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, catch-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as</NUMEX>-catch-can, yet sense deep down that they are robbing their youngsters‚Äîand themselves‚Äîof something vital.
The expression ‚Äúquality time‚Äù dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> that witnessed the largest rise in women‚Äôs participation in the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>. The notion was bolstered by observational studies of parent‚Äìchild interaction. In these investigations, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> exchanged positive emotional signals with and verbally stimulated their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, and read to and conversed with their preschoolers. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> spent time with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> but were not actively engaged with them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> and time again, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> developed more favorably, cognitively and socially, than did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.7
A close look at the research reveals that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who fared well experienced eective interaction over an extended period. In studies following <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> from infancy into childhood and adolescence, early brief episodes of parental stimulation and sensitivity did not result in more competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX> Instead, positive, supportive parenting that endured, even when it marked a change from an early period of parental retreat or negative interaction, was linked to favorable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development, including persistence in problem solving, high self-esteem, socially skilled behavior, closer friendships, and better peer relationships<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> In sum, high-quality involvement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> requires a certain quantity of time‚Äîactually, a great deal, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">I‚Äôll</ENAMEX> argue in this book.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tom‚Äôs</ENAMEX> case, sandwiching concentrated time with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Victor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jeannine</ENAMEX> between work and other obligations, which often took precedence over family rituals, meant that routines that signal parental caring and that are major sources of development went by the wayside. For example, family dinnertimes and storybook reading at bedtime became rare events. So did the sheer enjoyment that comes from relaxed parent‚Äìchild play; a joint cooking, art, or construction project; and a conversation based on real listening and exchange of ideas. Because these experiences were so few and short-lived, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> were deprived of valuable opportunities to observe their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> closely and to become intimately familiar with their talents, shortcomings, preferences, styles of learning, and ways of coping with hardship‚Äîknowledge that is crucial for helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> develop into mature, competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
Furthermore, the ‚Äútime bind‚Äù stiÔ¨Çes an essential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing responsibility that I mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and will return to again: monitoring children‚Äôs experiences while they are both within and beyond parents‚Äô immediate reach. This includes frequently touching base with nonparental caregivers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> to Ô¨Ånd out what‚Äôs happening at child care or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>; looking in on sibling and peer interaction to make sure that it is positive and respectful; and controlling time spent watching TV and playing video games.
In a recent provocative study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlie Hochschild</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> getting to know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Midwestern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> she called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Americo</ENAMEX>. Whether clerical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>, the majority conÔ¨Årmed the parental state of mind just described: They complained of overly long workdays and frenetic home lives. A surprising Ô¨Ånding, however, was that few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> had taken steps to make work and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> more compatible. For example, even well-paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were not taking the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> of federally guaranteed, unpaid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> leave time, although they could aord to do so. Nor were they asking for job share or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ô¨Çextime</NUMEX>, prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> policies aimed at increasing the compatibility of work and home. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hochschild</ENAMEX> concludes, ‚ÄúMany working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> of the time bind in which they Ô¨Ånd themselves.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù10</ENAMEX> 
As <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> become frenzied places in which work encroaches on family time and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are too exhausted or preoccupied to be physically and psychologically available, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> quickly become discipline problems. Their disagreeable behavior often causes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to retreat further into the haven of work. On the job, such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> feel competent and gratiÔ¨Åed; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> has turned into a place where they are harried, annoyed, and must deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who sulk, complain, plead for gifts, and are obstinate until they get their way‚Äîreactions that cry out, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">‚ÄúFifteen minutes</TIMEX>, here or there, with an essentially distracted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, is not enough.‚Äù
Fortunately, not all reports are as disturbing as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hochschild‚Äôs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Psychologist Rosalind Barnett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caryl Rivers</ENAMEX> conducted extensive interviews with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> dual-earner <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> area and found that despite stress at work and at home, most were highly satisÔ¨Åed and found child rearing to be both manageable and pleasurable<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> And in a survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DuPont</ENAMEX>, nearly half‚Äîand only slightly more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than men‚Äîturned down upward career moves to remain in jobs that allowed for more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> commitment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnett</ENAMEX> believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> most prone to a time bind in which work robs family life are at higher socioeconomic levels‚Äîin more pressured jobs that have less clearly deÔ¨Åned limits and in which advancement typically depends on superlative performance. Ironically, she notes, economically less well o <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> Ô¨Ånd it easier to establish a viable dividing line between workplace and home<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>
Although the precise extent of family‚Äìwork conÔ¨Çict in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture is not clear, its presence and detrimental impact on parent-child interaction and children‚Äôs development are well founded. Consider a series of studies that examined length of maternity leave in relation to employed mothers‚Äô psychological well-being and parenting behaviors. Short leaves of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> or less (the norm in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>) were linked to maternal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> and depression and negative interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>. But longer leaves, of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 weeks</TIMEX> or more, predicted favorable maternal mental health and sensitive, responsive parenting. 14 
Furthermore, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long hours</TIMEX> in child care during infancy and the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> are linked to less favorable parent‚Äìchild interaction. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study included repeated observations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, of diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, playing with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 6 months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years of age</TIMEX>. The more time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spent in child care (which ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 50 hours</TIMEX> per <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>), the less positive and responsive their mothers‚Äô behavior tended to be. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> experiencing less positive interaction were less engaged with their mothers‚Äîmore negative in mood and less aectionate<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> Yet another study‚Äîthis time, of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3- to 5-year-old</TIMEX> Ô¨Årstborn sons‚Äîsuggested that long child-care <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> can translate into behavior problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX> in child care interacted less favorably with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>. And such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> reported more noncompliant, deÔ¨Åant child behavior. 16
These Ô¨Åndings are not an indictment of maternal employment or nonparental child care. Rather, they underscore the importance of considering the needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> when making work and child-care decisions. Studies carried out during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX> on the relationship of maternal employment to children‚Äôs development revealed many positive outcomes‚Äîhigher self-esteem, better grades in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, more positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and peer relations, and less gender-stereotyped beliefs. 17 But repeatedly, eective parenting mediated these favorable developments. 
Employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> of cognitively competent, well-adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> value their parenting role and succeed at coordinating it with job responsibilities. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> schedule regular times to devote to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and combine warmth with consistent expectations for mature behavior. 18 Consider a study of the relationship of maternal employment to Ô¨Årst graders‚Äô academic and social competence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> of working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were equally or more competent than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of homemakers only if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> frequently experienced mother‚Äìchild shared activities, such as warm conversation and play. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shared</ENAMEX> activities were especially crucial for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> who had increased their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of employment during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding 3 years</TIMEX>, often from part-time to full-time. When a change in employment status was associated with high mother‚Äìchild engagement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> fared well. When it led to reduced mother‚Äìchild engagement, children‚Äôs competence suered greatly<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX>
Fathers‚Äô involvement in child rearing is an additional route to positive outcomes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> devote more than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX> to child care as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> do, fathers‚Äô involvement has risen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> of highly involved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> score better on measures of intelligence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> achievement, mature social behavior, and Ô¨Çexible beliefs about gender roles‚Äîin short, on all the positive outcomes associated with maternal employment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX> When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> support each other and share child-rearing responsibilities, both engage in more eective parenting<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX>
In sum, increasingly pressured adult lives have contributed to parental diculties in granting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> the attention they need. When employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> spend generous amounts of time engaged with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, they safeguard the child‚Äôs development. Under these conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> often reap extra beneÔ¨Åts from more equitable involvement of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. In contrast, a pressured work life that pulls <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing undermines infants‚Äô and children‚Äôs well-being‚Äîcognitively, emotionally, and socially.
Probably because it reduces work overload, part-time maternal employment is associated with better academic and social development than is full-time employment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX> Unfortunately, most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> do not provide this option, and many parents‚Äîespecially, single parents‚Äîcannot aord it. Yet as noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, Ô¨Ånancially well-o <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are especially prone to the ‚Äútime bind‚Äù but do not necessarily take advantage of available workplace options aimed at lessening it.

Child-Rearing Advice

Almost all parents‚Äîespecially Ô¨Årst-time parents‚Äîfeel a need for sound advice on how to rear their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> advice is particularly great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, perhaps because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> perceive that children‚Äôs problematic behavior has increased. Widespread <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> opinion, gathered from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, revealed that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 13-year</TIMEX> period, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were viewed as more likely to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúdo poorly on schoolwork,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù ‚Äúhang</ENAMEX> around with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> who get into trouble,‚Äù and ‚Äúdestroy things belonging to others.‚Äù Fewer were seen as involved in worthwhile activities that truly engaged them<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX> A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> survey of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> of whom were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, echoed this disheartening trend. Most viewed today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> as too out-of-control and undirected<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.25</NUMEX>
The call for parenting advice has led to a proliferation of volumes, Ô¨Ålling shelf after shelf in virtually every general-purpose bookstore and public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcorrect methods‚Äù advocated</ENAMEX> in these books vary widely, with many addressing discipline and communication, thereby catering to rising numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> with undercontrolled, apathetic, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goal-directed children</ENAMEX>. Precious few of these parenting manuals are grounded in the explosion of contemporary research on child development that is of signiÔ¨Åcant applied value. Rather, a plethora of opinion is available, some of it playing on and exacerbating parents‚Äô self-doubts with such titles <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">as Parenting for Dummies and The Seven Worst Things Parents Do</ENAMEX>.26 

one-sided views.‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇWell-known theories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development‚ÄîFreud‚Äôs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skinner‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gesell‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, for example‚Äîprovide little comfort, since dramatic shifts in favored theories have occurred since the launching of systematic study of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 100 years ago</TIMEX>. Indeed, this waxing and waning of theories has contributed greatly to discrepancies in expert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing advice, which (like the theories) has Ô¨Çuctuated between extremes‚Äîswinging, like a rhythmic pendulum, from an adult-imposed, directive approach to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centered, laissez-faire approach, and back again. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> commented, theories and the popular literature for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> ‚Äúhave done their share to undermine the wavering self-conÔ¨Ådence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚</ENAMEX>Äù27 The roots of these polarized perspectives can be found in centuries-old, dramatically opposing philosophies about the nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adult Supremacy</ENAMEX>. Writing at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the seventeenth century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Locke</ENAMEX> characterized the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> as a tabula rasa. Translated from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>, this means ‚Äúblank slate‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúempty container,‚Äù a being who can be freely <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúwritten on,‚Äù or ‚ÄúÔ¨Ålled</ENAMEX>,‚Äù with socially acceptable knowledge and skills‚Äîin essence, molded in any way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> might desire through careful instruction, eective example, and rewards for good behavior. Lockean ideas provided the footing for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">behaviorism</ENAMEX>, launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Watson</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s</TIMEX> and built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. F. Skinner</ENAMEX> into a powerful mid-century theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> heralding the supremacy of environment in its belief that behavior is shaped by external stimuli. 
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s and 1930s</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> had adopted behaviorist procedures in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> form or another. The most committed were well-educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, who read about conditioning methods in magazine articles and government bulletins on child care. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heeding Watson‚Äôs</ENAMEX> warnings about the dangers of overindulgence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> mapped out schedules and routines for their young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and tutored them in all manner of skills and in self-controlled conduct. In preschools and kindergartens, behaviorist tenets were used to justify large<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> drill on letters, numbers, and general knowledge as well as repetitive worksheet practice that required young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to sit at their desks for long periods, Ô¨Ålling in blanks, coloring within the lines, and otherwise following <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> prescriptions. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> anxious for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to display mature behavior were convinced that these experiences would prime them for academic success. But research eventually documented otherwise‚Äîthat regimented tutoring not adjusted to the child‚Äôs interests and capabilities undermines rather than enhances learning, motivation, and self-control. In preschools and kindergartens where much time is spent sitting, listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and doing worksheets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> exhibit high levels of stress behaviors, such as wiggling, withdrawal, and talking out. They also show a decline in self-conÔ¨Ådence and motivation, expressing doubts about their own ability and retreating from challenging problems. Furthermore, when followed up during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ô¨Årst few years</TIMEX> of school, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who spent their kindergarten year in a highly teacher-directed classroom achieve more poorly than do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agemates</ENAMEX> who come from kindergartens emphasizing play and hands-on, small<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> projects<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.28</NUMEX>
Recall 4-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lydia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dislike of her academic preschool, described at the beginning of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>. Lydia‚Äôs negative reaction is certainly consistent with research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ô¨Åndings</ENAMEX>. The behaviorist presumption that development can be mechanically engineered by social input, guaranteeing brighter, socially more mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, is not borne out by the evidence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child Supremacy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Countering Locke‚</ENAMEX>Äôs image of an all-powerful adult tutor, eighteenth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Jacques Rousseau</ENAMEX> conceived of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúnoble savage‚Äù‚Äîuntamed</ENAMEX> but naturally good, with an innate plan for orderly, healthy growth. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rousseau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> training served only to thwart the child‚Äôs inherently perceptive intelligence and moral sense, which unfolded naturally as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> moved through a sequence of developmental stages. 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rousseauian</ENAMEX> view provided the substrate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">twentieth-century counterpoint</ENAMEX> to behaviorism: a belief in the powerful role of children‚Äôs inborn characteristics. At mid-century, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud‚</ENAMEX>Äôs psychoanalytic theory vied with behaviorism‚Äôs reinforcement principles for parents‚Äô and educators‚Äô attentions. In the tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rousseau</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychoanalysts</ENAMEX> argued that powerful biological forces channel development through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> psychosexual stages. Although psychoanalytic theory embraced a far less benign view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">child‚Äôs ‚Äúinstincts‚Äù</ENAMEX> than did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rousseau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs philosophy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freudian</ENAMEX> ideas were nevertheless strongly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centered in declaring that not much could be done about the child‚Äôs basic nature. According to this view, the child‚Äôs sexual and aggressive urges must be harnessed in the interests of society, but socializing too early or insistently can cause serious inner conÔ¨Çict and psychological disorder. Therefore, psychoanalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to avoid the trauma of heavy adult demands and accept children‚Äôs intrinsic dispositions and tendencies<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rousseauian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centered theme surfaced, as well, in the realm of the child‚Äôs intellect. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Piaget</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twentieth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> of cognitive development, proposed a theory in which an intrinsically motivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> acts on the world, noticing discrepancies between the environment and inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, or ways of thinking. Gradually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> transforms those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> so they better reÔ¨Çect reality and permit more Ô¨Çexible, ecient thinking and problem solving. 
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX>, as the brain matures and children‚Äôs experiences expand, they move through a sequence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cognitive stages, or reorganizations of thought: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) sensorimotor, the stage of infancy, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> use their senses and movements to explore the world; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) preoperational, the stage of early childhood, in which preschoolers use symbols, especially language and make-believe play, to represent their earlier sensorimotor discoveries, but thinking lacks the logic of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) concrete operational, in which cognition is well organized and logical but limited to coordinating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two or three</NUMEX> variables when solving problems; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) formal operational, the stage of adolescence, which opens up the capacity for abstraction, permitting young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to coordinate an increasing number of variables and to imagine all possible outcomes in a problem, not just the most obvious<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX>
In contrast to the behaviorist emphasis on adult tutoring, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piaget</ENAMEX> believed that since development follows a natural, internally controlled stage sequence, what comes from within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is paramount in guiding cognitive change. The environment, including the social environment, is available for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to interact with as they make sense of their experiences, but it does not determine the evolution of the child‚Äôs mind. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are in charge of changes in their own thinking and that biological readiness enables them to capitalize on a wider array of environmental opportunities, both physical and social, in revising inadequate, incorrect mental structures and creating new ones.
Piaget‚Äôs contribution to the Ô¨Åeld of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development is enormous. He inspired more research on children‚Äôs thinking than any other single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorist</ENAMEX>. Especially important, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget</ENAMEX> convinced the academic community‚Äîas well as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and teachers‚Äîthat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are active contributors to their own development, have their own ways of understanding the world, and must be developmentally ready if teaching is to be successful. 
In the Ô¨Åeld of early childhood education, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget‚</ENAMEX>Äôs theory sparked preschool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> emphasizing discovery learning through children‚Äôs spontaneous interaction with the environment. Rather than teaching didactically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piagetian</ENAMEX>-based settings provide a rich variety of hands-on activities and encourage children‚Äôs exploration and experimentation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Educators</ENAMEX> inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget‚</ENAMEX>Äôs work hope that by repeatedly applying cognitive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in stimulating environments, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will notice and amend deÔ¨Åciencies in their thinking. 
In a similar vein, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ideas served as a major impetus for the open education movement in elementary education, which rapidly gained ground in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1970s</TIMEX>. It arose in reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> passivity exacted in traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> sat at their desks, listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> transmit ready-made knowledge, and used textbooks as the main medium of learning<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX> A glance inside the door of an open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> reveals richly equipped learning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> working on tasks they choose themselves, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> who moves from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area to another, guiding and supporting in response to children‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> needs.
Furthermore, children‚Äôs progress is evaluated dierently in open education than in traditional education. Rather than tracking how well <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> keep pace with norms, or the average performance of same-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, open-classroom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> evaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> on an individual basis‚Äîin relation to their own prior development. Following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Piaget‚Äôs</ENAMEX> lead, this approach accepts the premise that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> develop at dierent rates, although it assumes that all follow the same stage sequence. Undoubtedly because open education minimizes the importance of meeting normative standards, open-classroom school-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> fall slightly behind their traditional-classroom agemates in achievement test scores. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in open settings display other beneÔ¨Åts, including gains in critical thinking, greater respect for individual dierences in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX>, and more positive attitudes toward school<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.32</NUMEX>
As our discussion already suggests, a central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piagetian</ENAMEX> tenet is that it is foolhardy to try to speed up development. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of their own learning, then adult eorts to teach them new skills before they indicate they are interested or ready are doomed to failure. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> stressed the supremacy of children‚Äôs engagement with their surroundings over adult teaching, parents‚Äô and teachers‚Äô contributions to development are severely reduced relative to the child‚Äôs. In sum, compared to the behaviorist, adult-supremacy perspective, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Piagetian</ENAMEX> view stands at the opposite pole.
Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget‚</ENAMEX>Äôs overwhelming legacy, his theory has been challenged. Recent evidence indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> underestimated the capabilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and preschoolers and the direct contribution of adults‚Äîboth <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and teachers‚Äîto cognitive change. To illustrate, let‚Äôs look at preschoolers‚Äô responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget‚</ENAMEX>Äôs conservation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">problems‚</ENAMEX>Äîthe best-known examples of the odd logic of his preoperational stage. Shown <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rows of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six pennies</NUMEX> each, after which the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pennies</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one row</TIMEX> are spread out in a longer line, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 4-year-old</TIMEX> is likely to say that the longer row has more pennies. Similarly, after a large ball of play dough is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> smaller pieces, a preschooler usually insists that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> pieces have more play dough than the ball, even though none was added during the transformation. Yet a wealth of research reveals that when such tasks are scaled down in diculty (for example, using rows of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> pennies rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or seven</NUMEX>) or made relevant to children‚Äôs everyday experiences (pretending the play dough is cupcake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> pieces are little cupcakes), <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preschoolers‚Äô understandings</ENAMEX> appear closer to those of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> assumed<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX>
Furthermore, in tribal and village cultures without formal schooling, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who are cognitively adept in many ways <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> Piagetian conservation tasks much later than do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>.34 This suggests that to grasp Piagetian concepts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must take part in everyday activities, such as transforming the appearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> and reasoning about the result, that promote this way of thinking. Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in preliterate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> who fail Piagetian tasks display other impressive cognitive capacities‚Äîones required by and promoted in their culture. For example, among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinacanteco Indians</ENAMEX> of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> weavers of complex garments through the informal guidance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.35 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> with little or no schooling display sophisticated concepts of classiÔ¨Åcation and equivalence as the result of buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX>, pricing it with the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, and bargaining with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> on city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Yet when tested for similar understandings on Piagetian problems, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do poorly<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.36</NUMEX>
Finally, many studies show that children‚Äôs performance on tasks such as conservation can be improved with training<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX> This, along with the cross-cultural Ô¨Åndings just described, raises doubts about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget‚</ENAMEX>Äôs assumption that discovery learning rather than adult teaching is the most eective way to foster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">development</ENAMEX>.

absence of a unified vision.<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇParents</ENAMEX> trying to make their way through these opposing theories, and their attendant advice about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing and educational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>, are likely to Ô¨Ånd themselves in a dim forest, without a discernible trail blazed before them. Those who respond with sympathy and patience to their child‚Äôs inclinations and demands are as taken to task as those who set clear expectations and relentlessly insist that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> ‚Äúshape up‚Äù and comply with them. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> who throw up their hands in desperation and search through their own parents‚Äô or grandparents‚Äô shelves for a more ‚Äútried and true‚Äù vision will Ô¨Ånd themselves mired in the same conundrum. They might, for example, run across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arnold Gesell‚Äôs</ENAMEX> books of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1950s‚ÄîThe Infant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Child in the Culture of Today, The First Five Years of Life, and The Child</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten38‚</NUMEX>Äîstill prominent in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX>. Oering a lock-step description of physical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual</ENAMEX>, and emotional milestones at each age, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gesell</ENAMEX> aimed to reassure uneasy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that children‚Äôs problematic behaviors were merely a phase‚Äîpart of a biologically based sequence requiring understanding, not correction. A search of the previous generation‚Äôs parenting handbooks might uncover other volumes of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centered wave, including <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In Defense of Children, Children Have Their Reasons</ENAMEX>, and even <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stop Annoying Your Children and Parents, Behave</ENAMEX>! 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Experts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gesell‚</ENAMEX>Äôs time complained that he went too far in downplaying the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. His advice was soon overshadowed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamin Spock‚</ENAMEX>Äôs standby, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Baby and Child Care</ENAMEX>, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX> and selling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of copies over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven</TIMEX> editions, the most recent appearing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1998.39</NUMEX> Providing answers to virtually any question about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing that might occur to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, from physical care to emotional, disciplinary, and educational issues, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spock</ENAMEX> seemed, on many fronts, to lean toward parental Ô¨Årmness and away from children‚Äôs rule-of-the-roost. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">closer</ENAMEX> look, however, indicates that even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spock</ENAMEX> felt torn between the embattled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of adult and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> control. He tried to grant legitimacy to both poles, commenting that perhaps it‚Äôs not what you do but how you do it: 

A strictness that comes from harsh feelings or a permissiveness that is timid or vacillating can each lead to poor results. The real issue is what spirit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> puts into managing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and what attitude is engendered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> as a result<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.40</NUMEX> 

Above all, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spock</ENAMEX> admonished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to trust themselves, to have the courage of their convictions. Yet many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parents ‚Äúat sea‚Äù‚Äîin</ENAMEX> search of a sound child-rearing ideology within the morass of clashing dictates‚Äîundoubtedly found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spock‚Äôs</ENAMEX> directive hard to follow.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The past three decades</TIMEX> have seen a continuation of this dichotomy of extremes in parenting advice and educational practice. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, titles appeared that blew the whistle on permissiveness and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centeredness, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don‚Äôt Be Afraid of Your Child and Power</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parents</ENAMEX>. As part of this rebound, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gordon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parent Effectiveness Training 41</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">oered</ENAMEX> to rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who had allowed their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to ride roughshod over them. In the realm of children‚Äôs learning, books in the behaviorist tradition, advocating intensive, early academic training, resurfaced. A prominent example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegfried</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Therese Engelmann‚</ENAMEX>Äôs blueprint for raising a brighter preschooler, Give <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Your Child a Superior Mind</ENAMEX>, appealed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> bent on boosting their child‚Äôs IQ or‚Äîeven better‚Äîproducing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX>. In spelling out the theory, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engelmanns</ENAMEX> dismissed the legitimacy of biological readiness and proclaimed,

Every single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> at the top end of the IQ scale received early training. Every single one was subjected to an extremely active environment, not one that folded its hands and waited for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúmature.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù .</ENAMEX> . . The environment has to be empowered with the capacity to transform the ‚Äúuniversal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù .</ENAMEX> . . A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is the product of what he learns. His intelligence, capacity and range of skills reÔ¨Çect his environment‚Äîhis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>.42

Educational practice followed suit, moving back toward traditionalism. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scholastic Aptitude Test</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX>) scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> plummeted and concern over the academic preparation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> became widespread, a ‚Äúback to basics‚Äù movement arose that, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, was in full swing. Academic preschools Ô¨Çourished, and kindergarten and primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> returned to whole-class, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>-directed instruction relying heavily on workbooks and frequent grading, a style still prevalent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.43</NUMEX> 
Bipolar tensions in parenting advice and in educational methods continue to the present day. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Elkind‚Äôs</ENAMEX> book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hurried Child44</ENAMEX> is among the best-known of parenting volumes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centered, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piagetian</ENAMEX> tradition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elkind</ENAMEX> appealed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> prone to live for and through their child‚Äôs accomplishments to give up their vain desire for a superkid, refrain from exaggerating the child‚Äôs competence, and stop rushing and pushing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> into adulthood. In keeping with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rousseauian</ENAMEX> ideals, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hurried Child</ENAMEX> advises <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> from the harsh realities of the grown-up world and not to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äústress them out‚Äù by expecting achievements beyond their biologically based limits. 
As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elkind</ENAMEX> illustrates, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year-old</TIMEX> with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult responsibilities‚</ENAMEX>Äîsuch as preparing breakfast, doing housecleaning after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, checking that a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sibling</ENAMEX> is all right, assisting with meal preparation, and washing dishes‚Äîbarely has time for her own personal, homework responsibilities and is in danger of excessive stress from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúresponsibility overload.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù45 Schools</ENAMEX>, too, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elkind</ENAMEX> maintains, hurry and stress <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> by assigning too much tedious work and rushing them from one subject to another, depriving them of time to think and a sense of completion.
Harshly critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centered tenor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elkind‚</ENAMEX>Äôs message and pulling in the reverse direction is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Damon‚Äôs Greater Expectations</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,46</NUMEX> an impassioned plea to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> to eradicate what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> characterizes as a rising, insidious ‚Äúculture of indulgence‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúToo many children‚Äîthe auent and the poor alike‚Äîare drifting through their childhood <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> without Ô¨Ånding the skills, virtues or sense of purpose that they will need to sustain a fruitful life.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù47</ENAMEX>
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damon</ENAMEX> explains, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centered philosophy was a major breakthrough when Ô¨Årst introduced, in that it made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have unique needs and beneÔ¨Åt from warmth and encouragement. But, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damon</ENAMEX> contends, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centeredness has been stretched to the point of unrestrained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> gratiÔ¨Åcation, resulting in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> culture in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> are less engaged, less purposeful, less accomplished academically, and more egoistic and antisocial than in previous generations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damon</ENAMEX> acknowledges that economic constraints and other family pressures play a part in this youth disaection. But he places most blame on how contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are reared. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child-centeredness</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damon</ENAMEX> explains, has become an excuse for a rudderless parenting and educational culture that makes few demands while fostering in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-free, ‚Äúfeel-good‚Äù attitude in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are told, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄùYou‚Äôre lovable,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚</ENAMEX>Äôre great,<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre terriÔ¨Åc</ENAMEX>,‚Äù regardless of what they do. But because these messages have no basis in meaningful attainment, they are counterproductive. Sooner or later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> see through them, come to mistrust the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who repeat them, and begin to doubt themselves.
Damon neither endorses the insensitivity of adult dominance nor the tumultuous reign of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Instead, he underscores that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are avid, active learners, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> must cultivate their drive toward mastery. They must induce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to develop talents, skills, good values, and a sense of accomplishment through engagement not just in activities that are easy and fun, but in ones that are meaningful and challenging‚Äîthat help them sustain eort in the face of diculty, overcome obstacles, and advance to greater heights. 
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs message suggests, in building an eective vision of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing, neither the child‚Äôs inner thoughts and feelings nor the role of adult guidance can be singularly extolled or wholeheartedly ignored. To do either leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">educators</ENAMEX> to become trapped in a false opposition, to vacillate, and to think in oversimpliÔ¨Åed ways about how best to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> realize their potential to learn and become personally and socially responsible. 

toward a balanced perspective.‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇThe popular parenting literature is notable for lagging substantially behind advances in child-development theory and research. Today, sound theories and educational strategies exist that are neither adult- nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-centered but, instead, portray both as participating actively, jointly, and inseparably in the process of development. 
On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> point is the popular parenting literature unanimous: the vital importance of getting development o to a good start during the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> begin and the more continuously they engage in eective practices, the more likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are to sustain eort, achieve in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, develop productive interests, and become responsible, caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The longer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> postpone and the more unpredictably and inconsistently they behave, the greater the chances that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will develop maladaptive habits and unfruitful interests, doubt their capacities, become dissatisÔ¨Åed with themselves, and despair about their prospects for the future. 
After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> and debate, a new, more complex view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development is coalescing in the Ô¨Åeld, supported by rapidly accumulating research evidence. The fragmented, polarized theories of the past are giving way to more equitable theories emphasizing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and the social environment interact and that the contributions of each to development cannot be separated and weighted in a simplistic, one-sided manner<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.48</NUMEX>
Understanding this new view can be immeasurably helpful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, caregivers<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,49</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> in providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with development-enhancing experiences, since it oers a way of thinking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing and education that they can call on to guide decision making in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life. But a vital prerequisite for enacting this perspective is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, especially, must arrange their lives in such a way as to invest time and energy in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Indeed, as we will soon see, some children‚Äîbecause of genetic background, biological risk, or previous inept caregiving‚Äîrequire more intensive investment of parental energies than do others. Before we take up this emerging theoretical consensus, let‚Äôs address the question of whether greater parental commitment, in the context of today‚Äôs demanding and stressful work lives, is possible.


reevaluating the time bind

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX>, as I noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, often complain that they have too little time for children‚Äîindeed, too little time to sleep, read, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX>, exercise, and socialize as well! Their sense of being overworked and overcommitted, with few moments to spare, must be taken seriously. Feeling constantly frazzled can, in and of itself, interfere with relaxed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
Yet how pernicious and unique to our lives is this time bind? To gain perspective on this question, I contacted a noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> of family life<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,50</NUMEX> who suggested that I consult <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ise‚Äôs</ENAMEX> book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sod</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stubble, in which Ide</ENAMEX> chronicles his mother <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rosie‚</ENAMEX>Äôs life on a homestead in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX> as she farmed, kept <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and reared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.51</NUMEX>
Settling with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>, on the land in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> cooked on a stove so small that she could bake <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">loaves</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> at a time, so she had to bake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost every day</TIMEX>. She sewed to make the family‚Äôs entire wardrobe‚Äîher own, her husband‚Äôs, and each of her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children‚Äôs</ENAMEX>. Keeping up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> posed constant diculties. Cracks in the Ô¨Çoor planks and in the log walls permitted various pests to enter, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> battled bedbugs, grasshoppers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX>, which required frequent searches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a kettle of hot water in one hand and a can of kerosene and a feather in the other. Always, preparations had to be made for the next season‚Äîin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX>, for example, cooking enough molasses to last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>, a task requiring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of work.
Outside, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie assisted Henry</ENAMEX> with myriad chores‚Äîherding and feeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">livestock</ENAMEX>; making lye from wood ashes to be used in hulling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> for hominy; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">browning rye</ENAMEX> for coee; harvesting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX>; and planting and caring for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, Ô¨Çowers, grapevines, and a vegetable garden. When she was not helping with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> and the garden, she could be seen washing and hanging out huge baskets of clothes. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rainy days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> grabbed pans from the shelves to catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that dripped through the cabin‚Äôs sod roof, remaining poised to shift the pans from place to place as new leaks sprang. 
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> had time for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, as well as time to participate in family gatherings, community events, and learning and literacy societies. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were small, they accompanied their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> on outings and during outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chores‚</ENAMEX>Äîfor example, riding in the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">husking wagon</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> could easily see and talk to them. As they grew older, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> played at adult tasks and soon joined in and helped with many of them. 
Despite grim work lives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>, who had little schooling themselves, sent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to college and some to graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. They managed to be involved and caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, without all the comforts and time-saving conveniences that we now take for granted‚Äîa water-tight roof; central heating; fast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>; microwaves; vacuum cleaners; washing machines and dryers; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX>; telephones; and much, much more.
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosie‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry‚</ENAMEX>Äôs way of life was hard, and we shouldn‚Äôt go too far in romanticizing it, their story helps us put the contemporary time bind in perspective. It suggests that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who feel overwhelmed by life‚Äôs demands ought to be able to free up more time for their children‚Äîthe Ô¨Årst step toward high-quality child rearing. Recent research by time-allocation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Robinson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georey Godbey</ENAMEX> substantiates this conclusion. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> perceive their work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> as excessive, squeezing out other aspects of their lives, a dierent picture emerges when they keep detailed diaries of how they spend their time. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every 10 years</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godbey</ENAMEX> have gathered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diaries</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, representing a cross-section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. They discovered that not only are people‚Äôs gross estimates of time per week devoted to work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 to 8 hours</TIMEX> higher than those recorded in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diaries</ENAMEX>, but free time‚Äîtime unencumbered by any obligations‚Äîhas actually increased! 
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are working less than they did in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1965‚</NUMEX>Äîabout <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> fewer <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> per week for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> fewer for women<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diary</ENAMEX>-obtained estimates of free time average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX> per week for employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> for employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Godbey</ENAMEX> note that compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a generation ago</TIMEX>, the free time of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> is more plentiful but also more disjointed‚Äîa <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour</TIMEX> here, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> there. How do they spend it? <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> report that TV viewing consumes nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 percent‚Äîabout 15 hours‚</NUMEX>Äîof their unallocated moments. It seems easier to watch the news or an episode of a favorite TV show than to go to a concert, enjoy a leisurely family dinner, or take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>-diary Ô¨Åndings also verify that time constraints are greater for higher-income <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. Yet the income gap in free time is not large; Ô¨Ånancially well-o <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 2 to 4 hours</TIMEX> a week less free time than do their less economically advantaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Weekly</TIMEX> free time for privileged <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> with demanding careers is still plentiful. 
If free time is so abundant, why do so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> say their lives are pressure cookers? The reason, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Godbey</ENAMEX> suggest, is that our pace of life is faster. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> expect to do more, to live more intensely. Hence, they try to speed up the yield of time, often by doing several things at once‚Äîin the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX>, attending to work tasks while Ô¨Åxing dinner, watching TV, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ô¨Åelding Victor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeannine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs urgent pleas for attention. The very activity of squeezing more into the moment exacerbates the belief that time is scarce. This ‚Äútime-famine‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> is the wellspring of parental eorts to create quality time in the absence of quantity‚Äîa contradiction in terms. 
How can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> beat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútime bind‚Äù</ENAMEX>? Rather than merely cultivating time-saving skills‚Äîa remedy that, by itself, may even further compress time spent with children‚ÄîRobinson and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godbey</ENAMEX> recommend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> Ô¨Ånd ways to meld time-saving with time-savoring. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have full-time jobs, some time pressure is bound to be present‚Äîin getting shopping, laundry, and cleaning done; meals on the table; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to and from child care, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and various activities. Yet to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> adequate attention and involvement, there is no substitute for slowing down and reexamining the pace of everyday life. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> must ask questions like these: 

‚Ä¢Does my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have a sit-down <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> together on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most days of the week</TIMEX>, free from the distractions of a blaring TV and a constantly ringing telephone? 
‚Ä¢Do I have time on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most days</TIMEX> to interact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-on-one</NUMEX> with each of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>? 
‚Ä¢Do I involve my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> positively and usefully in play and recreation and in accomplishing tasks of daily living‚Äîshopping, cleaning, gardening, cooking, decorating, and repairing? 
‚Ä¢Do I provide my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with predictable routines; clear, consistently enforced rules; and sucient oversight, while they are both within and beyond my immediate supervision‚Äîpractices that help ensure that the time I share with them is plentiful, pleasurable, and constructively spent?
Clearly, true quality time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is quantity time and more! Fashioning time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to be together is the Ô¨Årst step toward implementing the ideas and practices I‚Äôll discuss in this book. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> step is an appreciation of the multiplicity of factors that contribute to development‚Äîan understanding that spells out parents‚Äô vital role yet clariÔ¨Åes how it joins with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to aect children‚Äôs development and well-being. 


child development: a new consensus

At the dawn of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a new millennium</TIMEX>, a fresh set of theories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development has blossomed. The new approaches are numerous‚Äîsome more concerned with motor skills, others with cognitive competencies, and still others with emotional and social development. Yet they form a consensus, a set of variations on a uniÔ¨Åed theme<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.53</NUMEX> Each borrows features from past perspectives that have withstood the test of time and integrates them with current evidence. The result is a new outlook on how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> acquire more complex and eective skills. 

Many Factors Contribute to Development

The new view assumes that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, internal and external to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, work together as a dynamic, synergistic system to aect children‚Äôs thinking, feeling, and acting. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> include the child‚Äôs heredity and biological constitution; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in the child‚Äôs everyday settings of home, child-care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and neighborhood; community resources for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>-friendly workplace policies and high-quality, aordable child care); and cultural values and customs related to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development and education<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.54</NUMEX>
Look closely at these ideas‚Äîthat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are aected by interwoven factors in biology, everyday contexts, and culture‚Äîand you will see that contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> are no longer one-sided in how they view the power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> versus the adult, or heredity versus environment. Most have turned away from asking which inÔ¨Çuence is more important to uncovering how nature and nurture work together to aect the child‚Äôs traits and capacities.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> now realize that quite normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> show both similarities and dierences in pathways of change. A common human genetic heritage and basic regularities in children‚Äôs physical and social environments yield certain universal, broad outlines of development. At the same time, biological makeup, everyday tasks, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in mastery of those tasks vary greatly, resulting in wide individual dierences in speciÔ¨Åc skills<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.55</NUMEX> And because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> build competencies by engaging in real activities in real contexts, dierent skills vary in maturity within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>! Recall the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zinacanteco Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> weavers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, who are advanced in skills relevant to their own culture yet behind on tasks devised for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in Western industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. They oer a dramatic illustration of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">developmental variation‚Äîboth</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and within the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heredity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environment</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inseparable</ENAMEX> 

Within this dynamic system in which inner and outer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> jointly engender development, each contributing factor inÔ¨Çuences‚Äîand is inÔ¨Çuenced by‚Äîthe others. Therefore, the roles of heredity and environment, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in his or her life, so closely interconnect that according to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, their inÔ¨Çuence is inseparable<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.56</NUMEX> To illustrate, let‚Äôs take two vibrant, contemporary research topics relevant to young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children‚Äôs</ENAMEX> learning: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the dramatic growth of the brain during the Ô¨Årst <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</TIMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">children‚Äôs temperaments</ENAMEX>, or genetically inÔ¨Çuenced styles of relating to their physical and social worlds. 

brain development. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think of infancy and early childhood as a time when the human brain is especially sensitive to experience. In line with this view, although genes provide the code for basic brain structures and functions, heredity goes only so far in aecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the child‚Äôs brain and the rate at which it develops. The environment has a crucial, profound impact.
How does early experience join with biology to aect brain development? The cerebral cortex, seat of human intelligence, undergoes dramatic growth during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ô¨Årst few years</TIMEX>. Almost all its neurons‚Äîcells that store and transmit information‚Äîare in place by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> trimester of pregnancy. Once established, neurons begin to take on unique functions by sending out branching Ô¨Åbers, which form elaborate connections with other neurons. Formation of this complex communication system contributes to an enormous increase in size of the brain‚Äîfrom <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 30 percent</NUMEX> of its adult weight at birth to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 2</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> by age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.57</NUMEX>
As neurons form connections, a new factor becomes vital in their survival: stimulation. Neurons stimulated by the surrounding environment continue to establish new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>, which support more complex functions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neurons</ENAMEX> seldom stimulated soon lose their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> as their Ô¨Åbers atrophy. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how, for the biological side of brain development to go forward, appropriate stimulation is essential while formation of neural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> is at its peak<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.58</NUMEX>
During early childhood, the brain is highly plastic, or adaptable, in that many brain regions are not yet committed to speciÔ¨Åc functions. This means that if a part of the brain is damaged, other parts can usually take over the tasks that would have been handled by the damaged region, provided they are granted the necessary stimulation. In a study of preschool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with a wide variety of brain injuries sustained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ô¨Årst year</TIMEX> of life, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Stiles</ENAMEX> found that cognitive deÔ¨Åcits were milder than those observed in brain-injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. And by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 5</TIMEX>, virtually all impairments had disappeared! As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> gained perceptual, cognitive, and motor experiences, stimulated intact areas of the cerebral cortex compensated for the early damage<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.59</TIMEX> By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 8 to 10</TIMEX>, most brain regions have taken on speciÔ¨Åc functions, so brain plasticity declines. Because of rapid brain growth and gradual decline in brain plasticity, the Ô¨Årst <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 to 8 years</TIMEX> of life are regarded as a sensitive phase of development in which appropriate stimulation is necessary for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to reach their full genetic potential.
In describing the close connection between brain growth and experience, I have used the expression ‚Äúappropriate stimulation.‚Äù By this, I mean neither impoverished conditions nor excessive bombardment with sights and sounds but input that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can absorb, as indicated by his or her approach, interest, and concentration. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton White</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Held‚</ENAMEX>Äôs classic study of the impact of early stimulation on development, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> in a barren <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> given a moderate amount of stimulation tailored to their ability to handle it‚Äîat Ô¨Årst, a few simple designs on the side of their crib and later, a fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mobile‚</ENAMEX>Äîreached for and explored objects <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks earlier</TIMEX> than did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> given nothing to look at. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> group of babies given massive stimulation‚Äîpatterned crib bumpers and fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mobiles</ENAMEX> beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Ô¨Årst few weeks</TIMEX> of life‚Äîalso reached for objects sooner than did unstimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>. But this heavy dose of enrichment took its toll. The massively enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> looked away and cried a great deal, and they were not as advanced in reaching and exploring as the moderately stimulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.60</TIMEX>
Much research conÔ¨Årms that overloading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with input leads to disorganization of behavior. Excessive stimulation also causes them to withdraw as they try to shield themselves from a stimulus deluge, thereby creating conditions that, paradoxically, are much like stimulus deprivation!<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> These Ô¨Åndings help us understand, from a brain-development perspective, the detrimental impact of excessive adult tutoring on young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, described earlier in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>. They also raise grave concerns about the recent proliferation of expensive commercial early learning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> are barraged with letter and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number Ô¨Çashcards</ENAMEX> and slightly older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toddlers</ENAMEX> are drenched in a full curriculum of reading, math, science, art, music, gym, and more<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.62</NUMEX> Rather than optimizing early neurological growth (as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> claim), these eorts to jump-start young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can inÔ¨Çict considerable harm, robbing them of a healthy start on the road to maturity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.63</NUMEX>
Our rapidly expanding knowledge base on brain development and children‚Äôs learning reveals that a genetically inÔ¨Çuenced roadmap for brain growth and a developmentally appropriate environment go hand in hand; the impact of each depends on the other. Appropriate stimulation ‚Äúwires‚Äù the brain, prompting it to form new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> and its regions to specialize. As this process goes forward, the brain gradually becomes receptive to increasingly complex and varied stimulation. This fosters further elaboration and specialization of brain structures and ever more advanced knowledge and skills. 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperament</ENAMEX>.‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇFrom the earliest ages, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> vary greatly in preferences, interests, talents‚Äîand in temperament, or style of emotional responding, the most thoroughly studied of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of individual variation. Temperament encompasses activity level, ability to attend to stimuli, and capacity to adjust the intensity of emotions to a comfortable level so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can remain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adaptively</ENAMEX> engaged with his or her physical and social surroundings<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.64</NUMEX> 
Temperamental dierences among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are of great interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> because temperament is believed to form the cornerstone of the adult personality. A wealth of research reveals that for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to develop at their best, the experiences <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> provide must be adapted not just to children‚Äôs general neurological progress, but also to their unique temperamental needs. 
Temperamental traits most often studied include attention span, fear of novel experiences, irritability when desires are frustrated, and quality of mood (positive versus negative)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> can rate their children‚Äôs temperamental qualities fairly accurately; their judgments show a reasonable correspondence with researchers‚Äô observations of children‚Äôs behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.66</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teacher</ENAMEX> ratings are even more precise, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are familiar with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and therefore have a broader basis for judging whether a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is high, low, or intermediate on dimensions of temperament. 
Let‚Äôs see how temperament <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">combines</ENAMEX> with brain development and experience, forming a complex, dynamic system that shapes the course of development. Take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>, who when brought as an infant to a highly stimulating laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">playroom</ENAMEX>, was agitated and upset by all the new sights, sounds, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch</ENAMEX>, when introduced to the very same playroom, watched with interest, laughed, and eagerly approached the exciting toys and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> scores high on the temperamental dimension of fearful distress. On observing him, most of us would call him a very shy, inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Mitch, in contrast, scores low on fearful distress and high on positive mood. He is, in everyday language, an uninhibited, sociable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.
To chart the development of shy and sociable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Kagan</ENAMEX> followed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> from infancy into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the school years</TIMEX>, repeatedly observing their behavior and measuring their physiological responses to highly stimulating, unfamiliar events. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 percent</NUMEX> were easily upset (like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>), whereas <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> were comfortable, even delighted, at new experiences (like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitch</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.67</NUMEX> 
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagan</ENAMEX>, individual dierences in arousal of an inner brain structure called the amygdala, which controls avoidance reactions, underlie these contrasting temperamental styles. In shy, inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, novel stimuli easily excite the amygdala and its connections to the cerebral cortex and sympathetic nervous system (which prepares the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to act in the face of threat). The same level of stimulation evokes minimal neural excitation in highly sociable, uninhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Indeed, shy children‚Äôs physiological responses to novelty‚Äîa rise in heart rate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil dilation</ENAMEX>, blood pressure, and blood concentration of cortisol (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> that combats stress)‚Äîresemble the reactions of very timid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and are known to be mediated by the amygdala<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.68</NUMEX> When neural messages from the amygdala reach the cortex, they lead a shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to interpret new experiences negatively and a sociable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to interpret them positively. Indeed, brain waves in the cortex dier strikingly for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.69</NUMEX>
Are these early, biologically based temperamental styles destined to last, restricting learning opportunities for shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> while opening new doors for their sociable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>? The answer, once again, depends on experience‚Äîespecially, parenting practices. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> shield <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschoolers</ENAMEX> who dislike novelty from minor stresses‚Äîsuch as eating and sleeping in a new setting or meeting new people‚Äîthey make it harder for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to overcome the urge to retreat from unfamiliar events. Under these conditions, heredity and environment act in concert to maintain the child‚Äôs fear, increasing the likelihood that it will translate into long-term adjustment diculties, such as excessive cautiousness, social withdrawal, loneliness, and (by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">school age</TIMEX>) overwhelming anxiety in the face of academic challenges.
This does not mean that a shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> should be forced into new situations with coldness, harshness, and impatience‚Äîtactics that magnify their dread of new and unpredictable events. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who warmly, but consistently and assertively, require their inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to try new experiences and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> and support them in doing so actually reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">child‚Äôs physiological stress</ENAMEX> reactions, fostering a more adaptive style in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Indeed, adult eorts of this kind are believed to be largely responsible for the fact that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70 percent</NUMEX> of extremely inhibited babies cope with novelty more eectively as they get older (although practically none become highly sociable).
Shy and sociable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> also require dierent adult interventions to promote exploration of their surroundings‚Äîan activity that (as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piaget</ENAMEX> pointed out) is essential for optimal cognitive development. Vivacious, stimulating parental behavior, including frequent questioning, instructing, and pointing out objects, is beneÔ¨Åcial for reserved, inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>; it helps them become interested in and engaged with novel toys. Yet these same parental behaviors interfere with exploration in very active, outgoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.70</NUMEX> For these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX>, too much adult intervention is intrusive; it dampens their natural curiosity. Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúappropriate stimulation‚Äù varies</ENAMEX> for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
Finally, culture aects the likelihood that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> will respond to shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in ways that foster their development. In Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, shyness is regarded as a form of social maladjustment‚Äîa perspective that heightens the chances that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> will react negatively to inhibited children‚Äôs reticence and retreat. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> evaluate shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> positively, as advanced in social maturity and understanding! The high value placed on self-restraint in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> culture leads shy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to receive very positive feedback from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. Consequently, inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> appear particularly well adjusted during the school years‚Äîwell liked by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> and rated by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> as academically and socially skilled<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.71</NUMEX>

The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roles of Parents and Other Adults: Agents of Change, Buffers, Gatekeepers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conveyors of Culture</ENAMEX> 

Environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, from adult‚Äìchild interaction to cultural values, join with heredity to aect the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with other temperamental dispositions as well. Throughout this book‚Äîand especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX>, which addresses the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with physical and mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disabilities‚Äîwe</ENAMEX> will see many more examples of these synergistic eects. In each, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of change is vigorous and profound, although not sovereign and exclusive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> cannot erase their child‚Äôs genetic propensities, but they can alter many of them in a favorable direction, especially if they have access to knowledge about eective child rearing and they intervene in early childhood, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> of greatest neurological malleability. 
Furthermore, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> apply good rearing practices, they serve as buers, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of protection, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> against threatening forces in the wider world. A common thread in research on the impact of stressful life events and conditions (including poverty, divorce, abuse, community violence, and wartime trauma) is that a close relationship with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> who introduces aection, assistance, and order into the child‚Äôs life, fosters resiliency‚Äîmastery of cognitive and social skills that enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to withstand and even overcome adversity. To be sure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who are relaxed, socially responsive, and able to deal with change are more likely to elicit the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can develop more attractive dispositions and adaptive skills as the result of parental warmth, attention, and consistent guidance<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.72</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> also act as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gatekeepers</ENAMEX> for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Depending on the experiences they oer, they open up or close o a great many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> for learning. These include toys, books, television, computers, special lessons, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> outings, time with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> and other extended family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, as well as the quality of child care, schooling, and the neighborhood they choose to live in (depending, of course, on the extent to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> oer viable choices). 
In all the ways just mentioned, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are vital conveyers of culture, through direct teaching of attitudes and values and through the pervasive imprint of culture on the settings and activities they provide for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. In the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> lies the awesome responsibility of conveying to the next generation the intellectual, scientiÔ¨Åc, aesthetic, and moral achievements that dierentiate our species from others. From the simplest preliterate society to the most technologically advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are charged with ensuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> acquire competencies that enable them to assume a responsible place in their society and, ultimately, participate in transmitting its values and practices to future generations. 
Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have an important say in the socialization process. For example, they usually become more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> at those skills that complement their native talents. And depending on their dispositions, the road to maturity may be rockier, requiring greater investment of parental energies and distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing strategies. Moreover, without a doubt, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> contribute greatly to socialization‚Äîespecially by helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learn to resolve conÔ¨Çict, cooperate, share, form deep attachments beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and otherwise behave in ways that foster social harmony. But the recent, widely publicized claim of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Rich Harris</ENAMEX>, in her book entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Nurture</ENAMEX> Assumption73‚Äîthat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are minor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> who are overshadowed by children‚Äôs genetic makeup and peer culture‚Äîis not correct. 
Indeed, many eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> development <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have countered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris‚</ENAMEX>Äôs thesis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> do not supplant adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX>, aunts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX>, family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris</ENAMEX> draws on evidence suggesting that children‚Äôs inherited intellectual and personality attributes lead them to evoke particular responses from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, which further strengthen the child‚Äôs inherited traits. For example, a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> receives more social stimulation than a quiet, passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infant</ENAMEX>; a cooperative, attentive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">preschooler</ENAMEX> receives more patient and sensitive interaction than does an inattentive, distractible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>; and a bright, advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is praised and stimulated more than a child developing more slowly. Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> concludes, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> follow a genetically preordained developmental course, regardless of parental inÔ¨Çuence.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> is correct that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> often evoke behaviors from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and others that strengthen their genetic tendencies, research clearly shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can, and often do, uncouple these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-to-parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">eects</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the substantial malleability of temperament in infancy and early childhood is explained, in large measure, by the fact that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are successful in guiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with maladaptive tendencies toward more eective functioning. Moreover, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of research on intelligence show that IQ, although not inÔ¨Ånitely pliant, varies greatly with the stimulating quality of children‚Äôs experiences<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.75</NUMEX>
Furthermore, no conclusive evidence exists for the assertion that the most consequential environment for children‚Äôs development is the peer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. It is based on an array of selective and equivocal Ô¨Åndings, mustered to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> that parenting eects are conÔ¨Åned to how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> behave in parents‚Äô presence and do not extend beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. I will show repeatedly in this book that just the opposite is so‚Äîthat parenting practices have much to do with children‚Äôs competence at language and communication; sensitivity to others‚Äô feelings and needs; capacity to get along with others within and beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>; achievement in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>; and guiding values, beliefs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX>.
In fact, this overriding emphasis on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> as a source of positive development is itself a product of our culture. Compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is more peer-oriented; it places greater value on gregariousness and being liked by agemates<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.76</NUMEX> As more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> with busy, stressed lives retreat from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> take over. Without a constructive link between the values taught at home and the values of the peer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the consequences of high peer orientation are decidedly negative‚Äîa rise in school failure, aimlessness, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use, teen pregnancy, antisocial behavior, and other youth problems of current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
Downplaying the role of parents‚Äîsuggesting that they are relatively unimportant in socialization‚Äîdoes both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and society a disservice. It leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne</ENAMEX>, who are on the cusp of a dramatic period of development in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their 2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son‚</ENAMEX>Äôs life, to express grave doubts about their own importance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Gardner</ENAMEX> notes:

These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who run them, sustain civilization and provide the disciplines‚Äîhowever fragile they may seem‚Äîthat keep our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> from reverting to barbarism<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.77</NUMEX>


sociocultural theory: dialogues with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> 

This book takes its inspiration from sociocultural theory, one of the dynamic, synergistic perspectives that has recently captivated the Ô¨Åeld. The central idea of sociocultural theory is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and his or her social surroundings join to provide direction to development; participation in social life guides and energizes the child‚Äôs mastery of new, culturally adaptive skills. Because sociocultural theory focuses on children‚Äôs access to and interaction with cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, it has much to say to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> about how they can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> develop into responsible, contributing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of society. 
Sociocultural theory originated with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lev Vygotsky</ENAMEX>, who carried out his highly innovative research during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1930s</TIMEX>, writing proliÔ¨Åcally on the contribution of social experience to children‚Äôs learning. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> Union‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-year</TIMEX> ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky‚</ENAMEX>Äôs writings was lifted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1950s</TIMEX>, his major works reached the West. They began to be translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1970s.78</TIMEX> By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> and educators‚Äîdoubting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Piagetian</ENAMEX> view of development and desiring to account for wide variation in children‚Äôs competencies‚Äîembraced Vygotsky‚Äôs ideas with enthusiasm<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.79</NUMEX>
According to sociocultural theory, cooperative dialogues between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and more knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> are necessary for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to acquire the ways of thinking and behaving that make up a community‚Äôs culture. These dialogues occur frequently and spontaneously as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend time together‚Äîin everyday situations such as household chores, mealtimes, play, storybook reading, outings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, and children‚Äôs eorts to acquire all sorts of skills. Although interactions that arise between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> may seem mundane and inconsequential at Ô¨Årst glance, sociocultural theory emphasizes that they are powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of children‚Äôs learning.
Consider the following conversation between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX> and his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> took a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer-evening</TIMEX> walk on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> beach near their home. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX> had brought along a plastic bag, as the beach was often littered with trash after a busy day.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>: (running ahead and calling out) Some bottles and cans. I‚Äôll get them. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX>: If the bottles are broken, you could cut yourself, so let me get them. (Catches up and holds out the bag as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ben</ENAMEX> drops items in)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>, look at this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a whole <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, really big. Colors all inside! 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel: Hmmm</ENAMEX>, might be an abalone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>: What‚Äôs abalone?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX>: Do you remember what I had in my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX> on the wharf <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>? That‚Äôs abalone.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>: You eat it?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX>: Well, you can. You eat a meaty part that the abalone uses to stick to rocks. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ewww</ENAMEX>. I don‚Äôt want to eat it. Can I keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX>: I think so. Maybe you can Ô¨Ånd some things in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to put in it. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Points</ENAMEX> to the shell‚Äôs colors) Sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make jewelry out of these shells. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>: Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mom‚Äôs necklace</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX>: That‚Äôs right. Mom‚Äôs necklace is made out of a kind of abalone with a very colorful shell‚Äîpinks, purples, blues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Paua</ENAMEX>. When you turn it, the colors change.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>: Wow! Let‚Äôs look for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Paua shells</ENAMEX>!
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX>: You can‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd them here, only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX>: Where‚Äôs that? Have you been there?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX>: No, someone brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> the necklace as a gift. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I‚Äôll</ENAMEX> show you <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> on the globe. It‚Äôs far away, halfway around the world.
In this dialogue, which lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few minutes</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mel</ENAMEX> conveyed important social values and a wealth of information to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ben‚</ENAMEX>Äîabout responsibility for preserving the environment, about safety precautions, about the wonders of an unusual sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>, about the beauty and utility of natural objects, and even about world geography.
According to sociocultural theory, as adults‚Äîand more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert peers</ENAMEX> as well‚Äîhelp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> participate in culturally meaningful activities, the communication between them becomes part of children‚Äôs thinking. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> internalize essential features of these dialogues, they use the language within them to accomplish new skills and to gain control over their own thought and behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX> The young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> speaking to herself when tempted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">forbidden object (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch!‚Äù</ENAMEX>), solving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dicult puzzle (‚ÄúWhere</ENAMEX> does this piece go?‚Äù), Ô¨Ånding an interesting shell on the beach (‚ÄúLooks like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mom‚</ENAMEX>Äôs shiny necklace.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX> ), or acting out a scene in make-believe play (‚ÄúWhat would you like for lunch? An abalone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich?‚Äù</ENAMEX>) has started to produce the same kind of guiding comments that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> previously used to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> think about the world and engage in important tasks. 

A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Socially Formed Mind</ENAMEX>

Sociocultural theory is unique in viewing inner mental activity as profoundly social. The thoughts and imaginings that make us distinctly human are not regarded as independently constructed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Rather, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> derives them from his or her history of relations with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. 
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vygotsky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologically</ENAMEX> endowed with basic perceptual, attentional, and memory capacities that they share with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. These undergo a natural course of development through direct contact with the environment during the Ô¨Årst <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> of life, similar to the process of exploration and discovery described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piaget</ENAMEX>. For example, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> gradually distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in their surroundings and realize that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> continue to exist when out of sight. They also merge objects that are alike into categories (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, and eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utensils</ENAMEX>), laying the foundation for mentally representing their experiences and thinking eciently. And they become adept at imitating others, a powerful means for acquiring new skills. These and other infant capabilities set the stage for language, which develops with extraordinary speed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year of age</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 2 to 3</TIMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conversationalists</ENAMEX>; by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 6</TIMEX>, they have mastered most of the grammatical rules of their language and have vocabularies as large as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> words<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.81</NUMEX> 
The milestones just cited are broad universals of development. They characterize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> everywhere, as long as they are biologically prepared to learn and live in stimulating physical and social surroundings. But once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> become capable of representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and events with symbols, especially language, their ability to participate in dialogues is greatly enhanced. This leads to a crucial change in development. The natural line of development makes closer contact with its surrounding social context, merges with it, and is transformed by it<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.82</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children‚</ENAMEX>Äôs social exchanges begin to inÔ¨Çuence their ways of thinking more profoundly than before, permitting them to acquire competencies in keeping with the requirements of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
A basic premise of sociocultural theory is that all uniquely human, higher forms of thinking‚Äîincluding controlled attention to tasks, memory strategies, reÔ¨Çections on experiences and ideas, techniques for solving problems, and imagination‚Äîare deeply aected by children‚Äôs social experiences. For example, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> suggests to a young ball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúWatch me, keep your eyes on the ball!‚Äù the adult helps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> control attention, essential for mastering any complex task. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> says, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs</ENAMEX> write the names of our snack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">helpers</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>,‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúPut all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> together and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> together,‚Äù she teaches vital strategies for remembering. And a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> who asks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúIs Brenda</ENAMEX> crying because you took her colored pencils? What can you do to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> again?‚Äù encourages <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to reÔ¨Çect on their experiences and to think of eective techniques for solving social problems.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> emphasized that to understand children‚Äôs development, it is necessary to understand the social situations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> devise for them. Any higher form of thinking, he pointed out, Ô¨Årst appears in social communication, between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of his or her culture as they engage in a joint activity. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only later</TIMEX> does it appear within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, as an individual capacity or skill<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.83</NUMEX> The child‚Äôs mind, then, is a profoundly social organ. Through social life, it makes contact with and is inÔ¨Çuenced by other, more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> minds, permitting transfer of the values, knowledge, and skills essential for success in a particular culture.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Importance of Language</ENAMEX>

Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> regarded language as the major bridge between our social and mental worlds, he viewed language acquisition as the most signiÔ¨Åcant milestone in children‚Äôs cognitive development. Language is our primary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> of communication with others and means through which we represent our experiences. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> start to think with words, language becomes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">indispensable ‚Äútool</ENAMEX> of the mind.‚Äù Just as a hammer is a tool used to gain control over and transform physical objects, so we call on language to inÔ¨Çuence the thought and behavior of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and ourselves<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.84</NUMEX> 
Language not only conveys culturally meaningful ideas but is itself deeply imbued with culture. It‚Äîalong with other symbolic tools, such as gestures, aids to memory, systems for counting, works of art, diagrams, and maps‚Äîis the product of the social history of a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the result of members‚Äô eorts to create a communal way of life. Indeed, the central purpose of language, from its moment of emergence, is ‚Äúcommunication, social contact, inÔ¨Çuencing surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù85</ENAMEX> Then it becomes an individually applied tool for governing our own thoughts and actions.
To illustrate how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vygotsky</ENAMEX> envisioned this close connection between social interaction and children‚Äôs thinking and behaving, let‚Äôs look in on another verbal exchange between a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> is pulling <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> in the garden while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 1/2-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggy</ENAMEX> follows along, alternately digging with her small spade and holding a toy telephone to her ear. Soon gray clouds appear along the horizon, and thunder can be heard. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggy</ENAMEX>, frightened by the booming sounds, whimpers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb, ‚ÄúScary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mommy</ENAMEX>. Go inside!‚Äù
‚ÄúThat thunder is way up in the sky, far away,‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> explains, pointing o in the distance. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt hurt you. We need to get these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> out before the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> comes. Just a little longer, and then we‚Äôll go inside.‚Äù
Maggy listens and responds, ‚ÄúNot scary, far far away,‚Äù and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> nods in agreement. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggy</ENAMEX> waits, she paces back and forth near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX>, speaking into her toy phone, ‚ÄúNot scary thunder. Far away. Get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>. Not scary, boom boom! Like a big drum.‚Äù 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggy</ENAMEX> has taken the communication jointly generated with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and turned it toward herself. She uses speech derived from that conversation to reÔ¨Çect on the thunder, allay her fear, and help her wait until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb‚</ENAMEX>Äôs task is Ô¨Ånished and they can go inside. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggy ‚Äúthinks</ENAMEX> aloud‚Äù with words, she converses with herself, in much the same way that she interacted with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. Over time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maggy</ENAMEX> will start to interact with herself silently, ‚Äúinside her head.‚Äù And as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maggie‚</ENAMEX>Äôs social experiences expand and become more complex, she will continue to weave aspects of them into her inner dialogues, acquiring new, more advanced ways of thinking.
A Ô¨Ånal point about thinking as internalized social interaction: Note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maggy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs telephone conversation with herself is not a simple copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb‚</ENAMEX>Äôs remarks to her. The sociocultural vision is very dierent from behaviorism, which views development as directly imposed, or shaped, by external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, contributing to the creation of their own thought processes by collaborating with more experienced cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in meaningful activities. The combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and adult leads to the communication between them. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> actively take over this interaction and gradually adapt it for ecient and eective self-communication, shortening and personalizing it. 
To capture this idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> selecting from social interaction in ways that Ô¨Åt their goals, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> like to say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Äúappropriates‚Äù‚Äîor adopts‚Äîtools</ENAMEX> of the mind<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.86</NUMEX> Others continue to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> as ‚Äúinternalizing‚Äù social experience but emphasize the child‚Äôs unique contribution to both adult‚Äìchild interaction and its internalization. Whatever label is applied, active engagement on the part of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, resulting in a ‚Äúmeeting of minds,‚Äù is central to this process.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purposeful Activities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culturally Adaptive Competencies</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> learn and practice thinking by participating in purposeful activities, organized by their cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. This ensures that they will acquire competencies that are adaptive in their culture. 
At very young ages, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are just beginning to acquire culturally valued skills, they depend almost entirely on interactions with more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to make sense of their experiences. For example, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year-olds</TIMEX> to Ô¨Ånd out what they remembered about a visit to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> recalled only information they had talked about with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>; everything else had been forgotten<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.87</NUMEX> 
When young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do not understand a concept or how to solve a problem, most often they lack experience in relevant activities with more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert individuals</ENAMEX>. For example, some ethnic minority <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, who grow up in more ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúpeople-oriented‚Äù than ‚Äúobject-oriented‚</NUMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, do less well than they otherwise would on academic tasks because they rarely participate in activities involving ‚Äúeducational‚Äù toys, games, and a question‚Äìanswer style of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adult‚Äìchild interaction (‚ÄúWhat</ENAMEX> color is that?‚Äù How many wheels on that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck?‚Äù</ENAMEX>), which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime children</ENAMEX> for academic success<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.88</NUMEX> Yet these very same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who do poorly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> can be seen telling complex stories, engaging in elaborate artistic activities, competently watching over younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and accomplishing athletic feats in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life.
The importance of activity contexts reminds us that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do not face identical tasks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cultures</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> within them responsible for socialization, select dierent tasks for children‚Äôs learning. As a result, children‚Äôs cognition is contextualized; it emerges and derives meaning from particular activities and social experiences. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> who spend little time in joint pursuits and conversation with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> convey to them a very dierent set of cultural values, practices, and cognitive strategies than do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who involve their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in constructive play and projects; encourage them to participate in family routines and duties, such as meal preparation and cleaning; and plan parent‚Äìchild outings. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> who require mostly solitary desk work from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, isolating the skills taught from their everyday use, promote values and competencies strikingly dierent from those cultivated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> who embed teaching and learning in meaningful collaborative activities.
The core lesson to be learned from our discussion so far is that development is a matter of children‚Äôs genetic/biological potential undergoing a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">metamorphosis</ENAMEX>, a process that cannot take place without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> as thoughtful and committed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in children‚Äôs lives. From the sociocultural perspective, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in awakening children‚Äôs minds and fostering their development; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are apprenticed to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>. 
Hence, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, posed at the start of our discussion: Should she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX>, respond to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anselmo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs pleas for help with his homework? Given what we currently know about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> develop, the answer is a resounding yes. Rather than promoting dependency (as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talia</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> fear), assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anselmo</ENAMEX> is the surest route to competent functioning, provided parental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">interaction</ENAMEX> builds on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anselmo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs current capacities and remains sensitive to his unique characteristics. Now let‚Äôs turn to just how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> can advance children‚Äôs knowledge and skills.
