In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, I take up dilemmas that todayâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> face in rearing young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Throughout this book, we have touched on myriad forces that make contemporary parenting highly challenging. These include one-sided, contradictory messages in the parenting-advice literature; career pressures that impinge on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> involvement in childrenâ€™s lives; abysmally weak <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> child-care services to assist employed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing roles; cultural violence and excessive materialism permeating childrenâ€™s worlds; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> with less than optimal conditions for childrenâ€™s learning; and impediments to granting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with deï¬cits and disabilities social experiences that maximize their development. 
Contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do not just ï¬nd <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing more difficult; they feel more uncertainty than their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX> about whether and how to intervene in their childrenâ€™s activities and behavior. In the pages that follow, I draw on major themes of this bookâ€”the power of adult warmth, appropriate expectations, narrative conversation, make-believe play, and teaching in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€â€”to</ENAMEX> show how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vygotskyâ</ENAMEX>€™s sociocultural approach can serve as a guide for resolving a great many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing concerns. 
This chapter answers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> questions drawn from a survey of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over four hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2- to 8-year-olds</TIMEX> living in a Midwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred thousand</NUMEX>. In that survey, I asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to list any questions about young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ</ENAMEX>€™s development and learning that interested or worried them. The questions I answer here address issues that appeared most often in parentsâ€™ responses. Each represents a concern that surfaced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more parental replies.
I intend these answers to parentsâ€™ questions to reï¬‚ect a way of thinking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing, not a set of recipes for dealing with speciï¬c events. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are familiar with principles that are grounded in contemporary theory and research on childrenâ€™s development, they can better deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quandaries</ENAMEX> generated by the changing home, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and community contexts in which todayâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> grow up. Although adverse cultural trends have complicated and threatened good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing, parentsâ€”as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of change, buffers against stressful life circumstances, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gatekeepers</ENAMEX> of learning opportunitiesâ€”can do much to protect, restore, and reshape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childrenâ€™s</ENAMEX> experiences.

My <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doesnâ</ENAMEX>€™t think very well of himself. Is poor self-esteem a major cause of learning problems? How can I increase my childâ€™s self-esteem? Should I be praising him more?

When we speak of self-esteem, we refer to the judgments we make of our own worth and the feelings associated with those judgments. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> with high self-esteem, although recognizing their limitations, are fundamentally satisï¬ed with their characteristics and competencies. Their self-conï¬dence, self-respect, and realistic appraisal of their current skills fortify them in the face of failure, motivating them to try hard to surmount challenges. 
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the school years</TIMEX>, individual differences in self-esteem are clearly evident and strongly related to childrenâ€™s everyday behaviors. That is, most school-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are quite good at judging their own strengths and limitations. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who agree with such statements as, â€œIâ€™m good at schoolwork,â€ tend to achieve well academically; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who concur that â€œmost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> like meâ€ get along well with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who say that theyâ€™re â€œusually the one chosen for gamesâ€ are more advanced in physical skills<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> sense this strong link between childrenâ€™s self-esteem and accomplishment. Consequently, they may try to build their childâ€™s self-esteem with praise and reassuring comments.
Although self-esteem and favorable development are related, high self-esteem does not necessarily cause effortful behavior and achievement. Rather, to help sustain good outcomes, self-esteem must be earned through commitment, responsibility, and mastery of meaningful skills<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> combine warmth with reasonable expectations for mature behavior feel especially good about themselves.3 Warm parenting lets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> believe they can succeed. And ï¬rm but appropriate expectations prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to strive for attainable goals and to use those goals as reasonable standards against which to evaluate their behavior.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> who deliver praise not based on real attainment actually undermine their childâ€™s development. It does not take long for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to see through these false compliments and to question their self-worth. For others, this unconditional parental acceptance may contribute to an unrealistic, overly inï¬‚ated sense of self-esteem, which is also linked to adjustment problems. In one study, second and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graders</ENAMEX> identiï¬ed by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> as frequently teasing, starting ï¬ghts with, and excluding other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were far more likely than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> to rate themselves as perfect on a self-esteem questionnaire<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> Their distorted view of their own competence appeared to undermine any motivation to improve their social behavior.
Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> canâ€™t solve a childâ€™s motivational and self-esteem difficulties through indiscriminate praise, they also canâ€™t do so through critical, impatient remarks or harsh, forceful tactics, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œYouâ€™re lazy!â€ â€œWhy donâ</ENAMEX>€™t you try hard like your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sister!â€ â€œDo</ENAMEX> that homework or youâ€™ll be punished!â€ These strategies spark anger and resentment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and undermine a positive parentâ€“child relationship, on which motivation and effort thrive. And they destroy self-esteem by conveying a sense of inadequacy to childrenâ€”that their behavior needs to be controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> because they are unable to manage it themselves. 
Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can foster high but realistic self-esteem by asking themselves three crucial questions:

â€¢Are the demands I make of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> within his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">â€œzoneâ€â€”neither</ENAMEX> too high nor too low?
â€¢Have I forged a warm parentâ€“child relationship so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is fueled with the desire to meet my expectations?
â€¢Have I used ï¬rm but encouraging tacticsâ€”scaffolding of academic tasks to promote autonomous mastery; narrative conversation about the importance of trying hard to convey strong work-ethic values; and joint participation in routines and duties, such as meal preparation and household chores, to assist in developing responsibility?

Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> donâ€™t need to feel great about everything they try. None of us is adept in every area. Rather, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the school years</TIMEX>, self-esteem differentiates into an array of self-evaluations. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children judge</ENAMEX> themselves to be good at some school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and physical skills but not so good at others. Eventually, they combine these separate self-evaluations into a general appraisalâ€”an overall sense of self-esteem. It remains positive so long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> feels that he or she is competent at some worthwhile skills<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> 
In sum, the route to favorable self-esteem lies in parentsâ€™ encouragement of achievement and responsibility. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have something worth feeling good about. Praise should be tied to real progress and attainment. Encouraging words are particularly helpful when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are trying their best but gains in performance are hard won. And most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> greatly appreciate a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parentâ€™s congratulations</ENAMEX> for a job well done. Positive self-judgments formed in these ways foster continued effort and mastery, which in turn promote high self-esteem.

How much television and what kinds of programs should I permit my preschool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to watch? 

The typical preschool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> devotes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 13 percent</NUMEX> of his or her waking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to watching television, a ï¬gure that rises to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> by school age. Clearly todayâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend far too many <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in front of the TV set, a circumstance that restricts time available for joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parentâ</ENAMEX>€“child activities, play, reading, and other worthwhile pursuits. Television is so pervasive an inï¬‚uence in childrenâ€™s lives that I discussed it at length in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> are wise to limit childrenâ€™s access to TV to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> to one-and-a-half <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours a dayâ€”no more than 10 hours</TIMEX> a week. Following that guideline would cut the exorbitant number of hours <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> spend watching TV by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 to 75 percent</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> also need to prohibit violent TV and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orient children</ENAMEX> toward educational programs that inform them about their world and toward entertainment shows that teach positive values and social skills. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>, I explained how readily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can pick up negative attitudes and behaviors from television. Fortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can just as easily absorb worthwhile messages and information from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX>, so parental guidance in this area can have great beneï¬ts for development.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>, I also noted that it is crucial for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to model good viewing practices; to watch TV with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, helping them understand and evaluate what they see; and to use televised content as inspiration for make-believe play and other enriching activities. Another suggestion: Try not to use television to reward or punish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. This increases its attractiveness, making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> want to watch all the more.

My <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-month-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> enjoy going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Broadcasting System</ENAMEX> website. Iâ€™m delighted that they spend time together, but the whole computer concept makes me nervous. Already, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> bangs on the keys and uses the mouse. How much is too much and how young is too young? 

<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> own a personal computer, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of these have access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internetâ</ENAMEX>€”rates that are growing rapidly<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itâ</ENAMEX>€™s not surprising that even very young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are attracted to the computerâ€”often more so than to television. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> school-age child commented, â€œItâ€™s fun because you can control it. TV controls itself.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â</ENAMEX>€7 Your key-banging, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>-clicking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-month-old</TIMEX> already seems to appreciate this sense of electronic control!
As I noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>, the computer, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV</ENAMEX>, has just as much potential for good as for ill. Hence itâ€™s another alluring device that requires close parental monitoring and interventionâ€”to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> from becoming addictive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX>; from immersing themselves in violent, gender-stereotyped video games; and from accessing websites and web pages with sexual, aggressive, or other inappropriate content.
Undoubtedly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> are beneï¬ting greatly from their time together at the computer. The warmth, exploration, conversation, and fun involved in this and other joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parentâ</ENAMEX>€“child activities strengthen emotional bonds and foster both cognitive and social development. But such an early introduction to the computer is not necessary. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> orient to computers because they frequently see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> using these stimulating devices, so they want to do so, too.
Almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">public-school classrooms</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> computer<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,8</NUMEX> and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preschools</ENAMEX> have them as well. But for the computer to enhance learning in early childhood, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> must guide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in its constructive use and help them acquire computer-literacy skills. Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 years of age</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can type in simple commands and play educational games. Although they like the computer, most preschoolers do not ï¬nd it so captivating that it diverts them from other worthwhile activities. 
A common parental worry is that computers will channel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> into solitary pursuits and disrupt their social development. To the contrary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> generally prefer to use computers socially. At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, they often like to engage in computer activities with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or older sibling because they can do much more with the help of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert partner</ENAMEX>. And at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> often gather around the machine to solve problems collaboratively.
How can parents capitalize on the computerâ€™s potential for spurring their childâ€™s development? A variety of educational software is available that permits <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to practice academic skills and acquire new knowledge through discovery learning, reasoning, and problem solving. As soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> begin to read and write, they can use the computer for word processing. It permits them to write freely without having to struggle with handwriting, and they can plan and revise their work easily. As a result, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> worry less about making mistakes, and their written products are longer and of higher quality<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> However, computers by themselves do not help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> master the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of writing, such as spelling and grammar<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consequently</ENAMEX>, they are best used to build on, not replace, other writing experiences.
Beginning in the late preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can learn to program. Specially designed computer languages, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LOGO</ENAMEX>, are available for this purpose. As long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> provide the necessary scaffold, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> beneï¬t greatly from programming experiences. They not only acquire a valuable new skill but master new concepts, become better problem solvers, and think more creatively<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> Also, since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must detect errors in their programs to get them to work, programming helps them reï¬‚ect on their thinking and regulate their own behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX>
How much is too much and how young is too young? Thereâ€™s no evidence that computer experiences make toddlers more skilled computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> or thinkers. By kindergarten and primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can gain much from computer activities. As far as how much computer time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> should permit, the answer depends on what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are doing. When they are involved in writing, problem solving, or other educational pursuits, thereâ€™s no special reason to be very restrictive. But not all software called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œeducationalâ€</ENAMEX> is the same quality, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are wise to evaluate what their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are learning. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> must ensure that time at the computer does not interfere with the variety of experiences <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> need to learn at their best. And playing violent video games and freely accessing the Internet should be prohibited.

How many and what kinds of toys does a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> need? My <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> is attracted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and war toys. How should I handle this type of play?

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha Bronsonâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Right Stuff for Children Birth</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">813</NUMEX> is as an excellent resource for selecting play materials that provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of varying ages with both pleasure and an appropriate challenge. On pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">138 to 141</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>, I provided an overview of play-material suggestions for stimulating make-believe and game play in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2 and 8 years of age</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronsonâ</ENAMEX>€™s book, youâ€™ll ï¬nd additional recommendations, organized into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> broad play-activity categories: social and fantasy play; exploration and cognitive mastery; music, art, and movement; and gross motor play.
Childrenâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and play spaces need not be ï¬lled with every toy imaginable. A modest number of toys is sufficient. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who have too much typically care little for what they have. When given a chance to acquire something new, they usually donâ€™t react with much excitement or selectivity. For materially indulged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, new toys are such a common event that a complacent attitude sets in. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> comes to think, if I donâ€™t like what I just got, I can always discard it for something else. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playroom</ENAMEX> heaped high with a jumble of toys, many broken and mistreated, also teaches <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX> need not be cared for and respected. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> often assume that the play materials <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> choose are the ones that are best for their development. To some degree, this assumption makes sense: If a toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">isnâ</ENAMEX>€™t appealing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> isnâ€™t going to spend time with it. So itâ€™s important to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with a variety of play materials responsive to their interests.
Nevertheless, preference is not the same as appropriateness. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> sometimes choose toys with very limited play possibilities and soon ignore them. Other toys should not be given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> because they encourage undesirable play behaviors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Guns</ENAMEX> and other forms of weaponry fall into this category. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>, I pointed to research demonstrating that these aggressive play materials promote both make-believe and real hostility in childrenâ€™s interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>.
When thinking about purchasing a new toy for your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, ask yourself these questions: 

â€¢Does my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> already have too many toys, and am I adding to this overabundance? 
â€¢Is the toy responsive to my childâ€™s interests, and is it likely to sustain his or her involvement over time? 
â€¢Do I want my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to acquire the values and skills the toy teaches? 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€¢How</ENAMEX> will the toy help provide a foundation for my childâ€™s future learning and development?

Iâ€™m expecting a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>. How much is too much information for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 4-year-old</TIMEX> about pregnancy and childbirth?

Itâ€™s easy to tell preschool and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">school-age children</ENAMEX> too much about pregnancy and childbirthâ€”more than they are capable of understanding. The best approach is to respond to their questions with simple, direct answers. The younger the preschooler, the less likely he or she is to notice the pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motherâ</ENAMEX>€™s growing tummy and to be interested in how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> got in there. Such questions as, â€œWhere do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> come from<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">?â€ â€œWhere</ENAMEX> did I come from<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">?â€ and â€œHow</ENAMEX> does a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> get born?â€ rarely occur before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 5</TIMEX>. 
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do ask these questions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> vary widely in how much information they are comfortable in providing. Up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 8</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are satisï¬ed with such general explanations as it â€œstarts as a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, which grows into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â€œgrows</ENAMEX> in a special space in the motherâ€™s tummy called a uterus,â€ and â€œwhen the babyâ€™s ready to be born, the motherâ€™s uterus squeezes and squeezes, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> comes out.â€ Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> show their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> books with pictures of fetuses, identifying those that are about the same age as the forthcoming sibling and discussing the babyâ€™s development as it progresses. Thereâ€™s no evidence that this is in any way harmful or that itâ€™s necessary during early childhood; rather, itâ€™s a matter of parental choice.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eight- to 9-year-olds</TIMEX> are ready for more detailed knowledge about how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> are conceived and grow, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of this age are getting closer to puberty. A variety of well-written and illustrated books are available to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> discuss love between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, conception, birth, and rearing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> need to select carefully, making sure they agree with the bookâ€™s values. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> books that I like are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How Babies Are Made</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Audrey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Schep</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,14</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Where Did I Come From</ENAMEX>? by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Mayle</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How I Was Adopted</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joanna Cole,16</ENAMEX> is an excellent starting point for discussion with preschool and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">school-age children</ENAMEX> who are adopted.

I donâ€™t believe in spanking. We do time outs, which seem to work for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our 4-year-old</TIMEX>. How long is time out effective, and whatâ€™s the next step?

Although spanking has declined over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 50 years</TIMEX>, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> admit to slapping or hitting their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> for misbehaving.17 There is good reason not to believe in spanking. A great deal of research shows that it promotes only temporary compliance, not lasting changes in childrenâ€™s behavior. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who are repeatedly criticized, shouted at, and slapped are likely to display the unacceptable response again as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are out of sight and they can get away with it. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of harshly punishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> develop into especially disobedient and aggressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX>. In a study of a national sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over twelve hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6- to 9-year-olds</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Straus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sugarman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Giles-Sims</ENAMEX> found that the more spanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> reported, the more antisocial behavior their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> displayed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> laterâ€”cheating, telling lies, being mean to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX>, and disobeying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>.18
Why doesnâ€™t spanking work? First, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> spank, they often do so in response to childrenâ€™s deï¬ance and aggression<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX> Yet the punishment itself models aggression! <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who are frequently punished soon learn to avoid the punishing adult. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> evade their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, they reduce parentsâ€™ opportunity to teach desirable behaviors. Finally, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spanking â€œworksâ€</ENAMEX> to stop childrenâ€™s misbehavior temporarily, it offers immediate relief to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, which rewards them for spanking. For this reason, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> is likely to spank with greater frequency and intensity over time, a course of action that can spiral into serious abuse.
This does not mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> should never express anger at or punish a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. An otherwise warm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> who is disappointed and disapproving lets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> know that the transgression is serious. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> realize that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> regard their misdeed as very important, they listen more closely<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.20</NUMEX> And punishment is warranted after repeated infractions. 
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have far better ways to punish than spanking. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these is time outâ€”requiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to sit aside or to go to his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Another is withdrawal of privileges, such as a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> or a weekly allowance. These mild punishments derive their potency from warm parentâ€“child bonds. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> of involved, caring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> ï¬nd the interruption in parental affection that accompanies punishment to be very unpleasant. As a result, they want to regain the warmth and approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> as quickly as possible.
An important preventive of misbehaviorâ€”and a vital element of effective punishmentâ€”is explanation. Pairing reasons with mild punishment (such as time out) leads to a far greater reduction in rule violations than using punishment alone.21 The reason the adult gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> must match the childâ€™s capacity to understand. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 2 to 3</TIMEX>, referring to simple, direct outcomes works best, as in, â€œIf you keep pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy</ENAMEX>, heâ€™ll fall down and cry.â€ By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can give more complex and subtle explanations. For example, they can refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">othersâ€™ intentions (â€œDonâ€™t yell</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>. She was only trying to helpâ€), to othersâ€™ feelings (â€œHeâ€™s proud of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, and you knocked it down; now heâ€™s very sadâ€), and to issues of rights and fairness (â€œThat toy belongs to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudy</ENAMEX>, so you must ask for a turnâ€)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX>
Explaining to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> what they did wrong, why it was wrong, and how they should have acted helps them recall the misdeed and relate it to expectations for future behavior. Furthermore, by pointing out the impact of the childâ€™s actions on others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> prompt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to feel empathy and sympathyâ€”emotions that motivate concern for others<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX> And giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> reasons for changing their behavior invites them to judge the appropriateness of parentsâ€™ expectationsâ€”to see that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are not being arbitrary or autocratic. Explanations lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to strive to meet parental standards because those standards make sense.
In sum, when time out is combined with reasoning, it remains effective through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the school years</TIMEX>. You can tell that your approach to discipline is working when time out and other punishments become less necessary as your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> shifts from externally controlled responses to behavior based on inner standards and compassion for others. Typically this shift is well under way between ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 7.24</NUMEX> 
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> ï¬nd themselves punishing frequently, then they need to reconsider the basis of their discipline. When sensitivity, cooperation, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> of affection are evident in parentâ€“child interaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as young as 2 years of age more often follow parental directives<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> with an affectionate, mutually gratifying parental tie want to heed parentsâ€™ demands because they feel a sense of commitment to the relationship. This reduces the need for punishment, freeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to focus on encouraging childrenâ€™s competent behavior.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> additional ways to avoid excessive punishment are worth mentioning. First, changing aspects of the environment can reduce childrenâ€™s problematic behavior. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> arranged for her younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to play at a friendâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> during his sisterâ€™s birthday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, realizing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> wasnâ€™t yet ready to join in the partyâ€™s activities and would likely disrupt them. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a close look at the reasonableness of the rules can be helpful. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> caught herself before yelling, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œDonâ€™t</ENAMEX> roll down that hill!â€ at her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. She realized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was unlikely to hurt herself on the gentle, grassy slope and that any grass-stained clothing could easily be washed. With a moment of reï¬‚ection, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> backed off from an almost-delivered rebuke to allow a pleasurable play activity. Finally, sensitivity to childrenâ€™s physical and emotional resources helps prevent inappropriate punishment. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are tired, ill, or bored, they are likely to engage in attention-getting, disorganized, or otherwise improper behavior as a reaction to discomfort rather than as an affront to authority. In these instances, meeting the childâ€™s needs makes more sense than punishing. 

Whatâ€™s the best way to deal with repeated tantrums in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 3-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who gets so enraged that he hits and throws things at you? How can you calm a preschooler when the situation requires him to listen and pay attention?

When a tantrum occurs, time out is usefulâ€”transferring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to an unstimulating area where he canâ€™t throw things until the emotional storm is over. If he tries to throw anything or to hit you, you need to prevent him from doing so, gently but ï¬rmly. Itâ€™s crucial to remain calm and to avoid harsh, coercive tactics, which will only fuel the childâ€™s rage and poor emotional control.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itâ€™s</ENAMEX> also important to ï¬gure out why these persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tantrums</ENAMEX> are occurring. As the often-heard phrase â€œterrible twosâ€ suggests, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> assume that tantrums are a fact of life for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>- and even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year-olds</TIMEX>. Once toddlers acquire the ability to follow adult directives, one way they assert their autonomy is by resisting parentsâ€™ requests and demands, using the familiar refrain, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œNo!â€</ENAMEX> And from time to time, toddlers lose control. When frustrated, they havenâ€™t yet developed many techniques for regulating their emotions. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who take mental notes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> on the number of compliant acts versus the number of tantrums are likely to gain a new appreciation for how infrequent their childâ€™â€™s tantrums really are. For most young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, eager, willing cooperation is much more common than opposition<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX>
If your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> has been emotionally reactive and difficult to soothe since infancy, then temperament is probably a signiï¬cant contributor to his behavior. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Youâ€™ll</ENAMEX> also want to consider whether any changes in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or the childâ€™s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life might be sparking intense anxietyâ€”marital conï¬‚ict, divorce or remarriage, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby brother</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, starting preschool or child care, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> going to work when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is used to having him or her at home. Parenting practices can modify childrenâ€™s temperaments and assist them in coping with stressful life events. Protection from family discord; extra parental warmth, affection, and pleasurable time together when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is behaving well; and ï¬rm, calm, and consistent discipline will help. 
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> build up to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tantrum</ENAMEX> gradually. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> can tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">itâ</ENAMEX>€™s in the offing, and sometimes they can distract the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> before it reaches a peak. For example, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is about to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œblowâ€ while youâ€™re out shopping, try involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">experienceâ</ENAMEX>€”pointing out things of interest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>; asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to help you select and carry purchases; and reminding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> that after the shopping is ï¬nished, you are going to do something the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> enjoys. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> interrupt a tantrum on the rise by redirecting the childâ€™s attention, they provide strategies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> can use on their own to regulate emotion. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> always wait to intervene after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> has become intensely distressed, itâ€™s harder not only for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> to calm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> but for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to learn to calm down. And once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> regains emotional control, reassuring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of parental love with hugs and comforting words restores the parentâ€“child relationship and strengthens the childâ€™s sense of security.
Make-believe play is an effective context in which preschoolers can practice what to do when frustrated. Parent and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can take turns acting out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œparentâ€ and â€œchildâ€</ENAMEX> roles. While playing the â€œchild,â€ the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> can get upset. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can come up with ways to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">â€œchildâ€</ENAMEX> control intense feelings. Occasionally during make-believe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> send <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> clear messages about disciplinary tactics they want and need to quell tantrums. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonja</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> at witâ€™s end over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her 4-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredithâ</ENAMEX>€™s frequent ï¬ts of kicking and screaming, consulted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child psychologist</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith</ENAMEX> play the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œmotherâ€</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonja</ENAMEX> play the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œchild</ENAMEX>.â€ 
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œchildâ€</ENAMEX> asked for a cookie, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œmotherâ€</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œNo cookies</ENAMEX> before dinner. You can have a cookie after dinner.â€
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonja the â€œchildâ€</ENAMEX> began to mimic her daughterâ€™s tantrums. â€œI want a cookie. I want <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX>! Gimme my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies!â€</ENAMEX> she shouted.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œNo!â€ Meredith the â€œmotherâ€</ENAMEX> answered, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œNo cookies</ENAMEX> until after dinner.â€
â€œI want <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> now!â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonja the â€œchildâ€</ENAMEX> wailed while thrashing about in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Meredithâ</ENAMEX>€™s usual fashion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith</ENAMEX> looked on, dismayed by her motherâ€™s unruly behavior. Then she stepped out of the play and instructed, â€œYouâ€™re supposed to say, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€˜No cookies â€˜til</ENAMEX> later,<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€™ Mommy</ENAMEX>.â€
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonja the â€œchildâ€</ENAMEX> continued her screaming and crying, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith</ENAMEX> stated more insistently, â€œMommy, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€˜No cookies</ENAMEX>! You canâ€™t have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> before dinner!â€™â€
With the psychologistâ€™s help, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonja</ENAMEX> reï¬‚ected on the play episode, realizing that sheâ€™d been inconsistent in handling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredithâ</ENAMEX>€™s outbursts, sometimes resisting, at other times giving in. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith</ENAMEX> continued the tantrums to get her way, yet she desperately wanted to stop these explosions and to follow sensible, consistent rules. To do so, she needed her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to send a clear, rational, and steadfast message that tantrums are inappropriate and ineffectual and that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> are eaten after dinner.

What suggestions do you have for disciplining a strong-willed, stubborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>? Nothing seems to work, including time out and loss of privileges.

As this question makes clear, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are far harder to discipline than others. A childâ€™s temperament affects the ease with which he or she will follow parental directives and listen to explanations. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX>, I indicated that the impulsivity and emotional reactivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with ADHD make them very hard to rear and often lead to strife-ridden adultâ€“child relationships, which further reduce childrenâ€™s cooperation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willful</ENAMEX>, stubborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are also challenging to discipline. They tend to evoke harsh punishment, which heightens their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. 
A seemingly stubborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> may feel so little anxiety that parental disapproval and mild punishment do not spark enough inner discomfort to motivate compliance. Consequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of headstrong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> must use ï¬rm, consistent discipline and repeatedly explain how to behave and why. At the same time, such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> must resist the temptation to engage in carping criticism, harshness, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. A warm parentâ€“child bond based on cooperation is especially vital for helping recalcitrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> internalize parentsâ€™ standards. It provides the obstinate youngster, who feels little or no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> when reprimanded, with an alternative foundation for meeting parentsâ€™ expectations: a desire to preserve a spirit of affection and harmony with the parent<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.27</NUMEX>
Because parentsâ€™ communication with noncompliant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is often riddled with negativity, it can take time to get the relationship on a better track. Arranging regular times for joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parentâ</ENAMEX>€“child pleasurable activities is vital. Making sure to notice and praise the childâ€™s favorable behavior also reduces the negative cloud hanging over parentâ€“child interaction. 
Finally, looking for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œsilver liningâ€</ENAMEX> in the childâ€™s difficult disposition can help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> muster the fortitude needed to rear a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with a difficult disposition. Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX>, one of the most obstinate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in a study of the combined impact that temperament and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing have on long-term development<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beginning in infancy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX> rejected many routines and experiences, including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, bedtime, and new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>. He shrieked, cried, and struggled to get away. Yet his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> regarded his emotional intensity as a sign of inner strength and vigor. They believed that if they were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and ï¬rmly insistent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX> would, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, adapt positively.
By the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX> reached school age, he was doing remarkably well. The energies he had previously invested in stubborn rebellion were channeled constructively. He did well in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and became enthusiastically involved in several activities. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these was playing the pianoâ€”lessons that he had asked for but (in his typical fashion) at ï¬rst disliked intensely. Carlâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had granted his request for piano instruction under one condition: that he stick to the lessons for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>. She held him to this agreement despite his protests, which gradually subsided. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl</ENAMEX> came to love his introduction to music. His parentsâ€™ warmth, determination, and consistency had helped him gain control of his behavior and beneï¬t from new learning opportunities.

How can you get an inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who loves quiet play to be more active and sociable?

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> of quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> often wonder whether their youngster is developing normally. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Preschoolers</ENAMEX> whose play and behavior are typically mature for their age but who prefer solitary, tranquil activities are probably doing just ï¬ne, both cognitively and socially. As I indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 3</ENAMEX>, only certain kinds of nonsocial activityâ€”aimless wandering; immature, repetitive motor action; and anxious hovering around <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> without joining in their playâ€”are cause for concern<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX> Most play of quiet preschoolers is not of this kind. Instead, it is positive and constructive, consisting of such activities as art, make-believe play, puzzles, and block-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
Our society places such a high value on sociability that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> often regard quiet reserve as a sign of maladjustment. Yet not all cultures see things this way. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, for example, view quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> very positivelyâ€”as advanced in social maturity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> primary-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> also value restrained, persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> behavior, and they regard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who would be average in activity level in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as poorly behaved and unmotivated<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equating</ENAMEX> an energetic pace and gregariousness with normality is a Western cultural phenomenonâ€”one that does not match what we know about quiet, nonanxious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Most are bright <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> with intense interests who, when they do play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, show socially skilled behavior<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.32</NUMEX>
Nevertheless, you might want to encourage a quiet, inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to engage in active play from time to timeâ€”to ensure healthy exercise and to broaden the childâ€™s experiences. The best way to do this is to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in active games, such as tag, relay races, hide-and-seek, and throwing and catching. Creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€</ENAMEX> for learningâ€”by ensuring that active play is fun, provides plenty of opportunity to practice physical skills, and is not overstimulating for the quiet childâ€”will increase the success of these efforts. You wonâ€™t be able to transform a quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> into a physical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynamo</ENAMEX>, but you can help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> learn to enjoy moderate physical activity. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> may be gratiï¬ed to learn that a calm, less active nature typically makes a child easier to rear.

How does a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> gain respect from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who sees the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> acting disrespectfully toward his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX>?

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> learn much about how to relate to others by observing their parentsâ€™ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> communication. Marital conï¬‚ict is linked to hostile behavior and poor emotional adjustment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, including feeling sad and engaging in aggressive acts<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.33</NUMEX> Hearing one or both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> berate the other leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to act similarlyâ€”toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>. If disrespect between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> includes physical harm, then childrenâ€™s difficulties can escalate further<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX>
Besides modeling destructive forms of interaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who behave hurtfully toward each other generally interact hostilely with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> They also tend to use inconsistent disciplineâ€”alternately strict and lax<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.36</NUMEX> When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> scold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> on some occasions but permit them to act inappropriately on others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are confused about how to behave and engage in especially high rates of disobedience.
In sum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> behaving insolently to each other are up against a brick wall in getting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to behave respectfully. They need to repair their relationship. Seeking the help of a marriage and family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselor</ENAMEX> without delay is the best way to prevent the childâ€™s emotionally despondent and angry reactions from spiraling into lasting adjustment problems. 

Any tips on raising an only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>?

The best way for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to ensure that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> fare well is to engage them in development-enhancing dialogues, to impose reasonable expectations for mature behavior, and to discipline effectively. Overall, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are quite successful in attaining these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing goals. Contrary to popular belief, only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are not destined to become spoiled and selï¬sh. Instead, research consistently shows that they are as well adjusted and as socially competent as other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. And they form just as close and as rewarding friendships as do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, suggesting that they can and do learn to share and to be considerate of othersâ€™ needs. Furthermore, only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have a more positive sense of self-esteem and do better in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> than do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> growing up in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX> 
A major reason for these positive outcomes is that having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> generally means a closer parentâ€“child relationship; more time for high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parentâ€“child interaction</ENAMEX>; and greater encouragement for mastery and accomplishment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38</NUMEX> But because only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> lose the lifelong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneï¬ts</ENAMEX> of positive sibling ties, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> might take steps to enrich the childâ€™s life with sibling-like relationshipsâ€”for example, by cultivating warm bonds with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of close family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. In sum, with good parenting, only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> fare extremely well.

How can you keep a childâ€™s self-esteem high while still praising a siblingâ€™s achievements and good behavior? When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> â€œacts outâ€ because of sibling jealousy, whatâ€™s the best way to handle it? 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> display wide individual differences in the quality of their sibling ties. Once again, temperament makes a difference. For example, arguments between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> increase when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is emotionally intense and highly active<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.39</NUMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can do much to foster favorable sibling interaction. During the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> tend to be more positive and playful with <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-borns than ï¬rst-borns, and they discipline the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> more<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.40</NUMEX> This differential treatment is understandable, in that older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are more competent and capable, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> expect more. But being older also means more privilegesâ€”for example, being able to stay overnight at a friendâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or enroll in certain after-school activities and lessons. These advantages may help compensate for an older childâ€™s perception that a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sibling</ENAMEX> is receiving better treatment. 
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> experience intensifying sibling conï¬‚ict, they may want to reevaluate their communication with each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warmth</ENAMEX> and frequent expressions of affection are associated with positive sibling interaction, whereas harshness and coldness are associated with sibling antagonism<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.41</NUMEX> Once established, this link between parentâ€“child and sibling relationships is self-perpetuating. Warm parenting fosters considerate sibling interaction, which prompts positive parental communication in the future. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are hostile and coercive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> act similarly toward their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, and parental anger escalates.
The elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> are a time when sibling conï¬‚ict can increase. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> get feedback about how well they are doing in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and in other activities (such as sports and music lessons), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> may compare their accomplishments, especially when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> are close in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> and the same gender. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who feels less valued is likely to resent a sibling whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> seem to prefer. Therefore, when praising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> should try not to diminish the merits of another. If a sibling expresses jealousy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can remind the envious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of an admirable personal trait or a recent commendable performance. But be careful not to give empty praise (not based on real accomplishment), which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> quickly come to mistrust. It may fuel jealousy of a sibling, whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> concludes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> really appreciate.
In sum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can foster positive sibling ties through expressing warmth and affection, stressing each childâ€™s positive qualities and achievements, and refraining from making comparisons. When sibling relationships are friendly and sympathetic, they bring many beneï¬ts, including gratifying companionship, emotional support, and assistance with everyday tasks.

Should you try to curb bossy behavior when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> are playing together? If so, at what age?

Yes, you should step in and teach alternative, cooperative modes of interactionâ€”at as early an age as you observe bossiness. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> who has trouble engaging in give and take during play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> will quickly become embroiled in conï¬‚ict.
As I noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 4</ENAMEX>, pleasurable, rewarding play depends on attaining intersubjectivity, or shared understanding. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> must resolve differences of opinion and ï¬nd ways to meet both their own needs and those of their playmates. When domineering, uncooperative behavior is extreme, the bossy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is likely to be rejected by agemates. Long-term peer rejection, as I indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX>, not only leads to an unhappy social life but to serious adjustment problems in adolescence and early adulthood.
When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> uses bossy tactics, interrupt the play and ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to think of a better way to get others to cooperate, such as making requests and taking into account the playmateâ€™s preferences. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> canâ€™t think of alternatives, suggest and model several. If bossiness continues unabated, insist that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> leave the play area, explaining why he or she must do so. During times when youâ€™re alone with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, talk about problems that have arisen in peer and sibling play and help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> think of good social problem-solving strategies. Then act out these situations in make-believe, granting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> plenty of practice in applying effective social skills and showing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> how others are likely to react if bossy behavior returns.

How can a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> identify the difference between a language disorder and normal language development? What resources are available?

If your childâ€™s language development is delayed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> when compared to norms for early language milestones, then your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> might have a language disorder. But keep in mind that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> vary greatly in their pace of language learning. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are slightly ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> in early vocabulary growth, and reserved, cautious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> often wait until they understand a great deal before trying to speak<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.42</NUMEX> When they ï¬nally do speak, their vocabularies grow rapidly. 
Here is a summary of major language milestones for the ï¬rst <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 years</TIMEX>:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Approximate AgeMilestone</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 months</TIMEX> Coos, or makes pleasurable 
vowel sounds, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œaaaaaâ€</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œoooo.â€
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> monthsBabbles, or repeats consonantâ€“vowel sounds 
in long strings, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œbabababababa</ENAMEX>.â€
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6â€“14</NUMEX> monthsBabbled sounds expand greatly; 
around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX>, they reï¬‚ect the sounds 
and rhythms of the infantâ€™s language 
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8â€“12</NUMEX> monthsUnderstands some words. 
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 monthsSays</TIMEX> ï¬rst recognizable word.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18â€“24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monthsVocabulary</ENAMEX> expands from about 
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 to 200</NUMEX> words.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20â€“26</NUMEX> monthsCombines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27 months</TIMEX> and onSpeaks in longer sentences; 
participates easily in a conversation 
with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>. 

Because of wide individual differences, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">itâ€™s</ENAMEX> sometimes hard to tell a language disorder from normal variation in language development. If youâ€™re concerned about your childâ€™s language progress, consult a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">speechâ€“language pathologist</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Speechâ€“Languageâ€“Hearing Association</ENAMEX> (ASHA) maintains a list of certiï¬ed speechâ€“language pathologists for referrals. You can contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> at (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">638-8255</ENAMEX>.
The most common cause of early language problems is a hearing loss. Typically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">impairments</ENAMEX> are not identiï¬ed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 to 25 months of age</TIMEX>, when speech and language development is already delayed. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASHA</ENAMEX> recommends that all newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> be screened for hearing disorders before they leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. Newborn testing takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few minutes</TIMEX> and permits problems to be addressed early, preventing negative consequences for all aspects of psychological development.
Hearing loss can also emerge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>. The most common cause during toddlerhood and the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> is repeated otitis media, or middle ear infection. Some episodes are painful, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> detect them, but many are accompanied by few or no symptoms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> with recurrent otitis media bouts have trouble making out what others are saying. Hence they are distractible, behind in language progress, and socially isolated; and they also achieve poorly in school<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.43</NUMEX> 
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> begin preschool or child care, they are more susceptible to otitis media because of close contact with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Therefore, frequent screening for the disease, followed by prompt medical intervention, is vital. Interestingly, verbally stimulating adultâ€“child interaction and high-quality child care help reduce developmental problems associated with otitis media<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.44</NUMEX> When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults converse</ENAMEX> often with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and keep environmental noise to a minimum, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with persistent ear infections have more opportunities to hear and respond to spoken language.

Iâ€™m trying to decide whether to enroll my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> in kindergarten or wait until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>. How can I tell if heâ€™s ready for kindergarten? If he doesnâ€™t do well in kindergarten, should he repeat it or go into a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œtransitionâ€ class</ENAMEX>?
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> struggle with the decision of whether to enroll their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in kindergarten once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> meets the age requirements. Most often, they consider delaying the start of school for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, who as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> tend to lag behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in cognitive and social development. At the heart of parentsâ€™ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is whether their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> will be able to meet the academic and social demands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kindergarten classroom</ENAMEX>.
Although many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> believe that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whoâ</ENAMEX>€™s on the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">side</ENAMEX> can beneï¬t from waiting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another year</TIMEX> before enrolling in kindergarten and advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> out, research has not revealed any advantages for delayed entry. A host of studies indicate that younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> make just as much progress, academically and socially, as do older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> enrolled in the same grade. No difference exists between younger and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> in achievement test scores<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.45</NUMEX> 
A related dilemma involves whether to retain a kindergartner for a second kindergarten year if he or she is not progressing well. More than a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">half-century</TIMEX> of research has failed to show any learning beneï¬ts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> retained in grade, and mounting evidence indicates that retention can be harmful, prompting negative attitudes toward school and a drop in self-esteem and in academic motivation, even as early as kindergarten<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.46</NUMEX> In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study, retained kindergarten <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, despite the extra year of school, scored lower than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> in academic achievement after entering the primary grades. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> recommended for retention but who nevertheless went on to ï¬rst grade were doing just as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> who had been promoted in the standard fashion<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.47</NUMEX>
Yet another alternative is to place a poorly performing kindergarten <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œtransitionâ€ classâ€”a waystation</ENAMEX> between kindergarten and ï¬rst grade. Transition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, however, are a form of homogeneous grouping that gathers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> judged by the school system as less likely to succeed. As with other â€œlow-abilityâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> often have lower expectations for transition-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and teach them in a less stimulating fashion than they do other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.48</NUMEX> 
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> that each of the options just mentioned assumes that readiness is inherent in the childâ€”that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 5-year-old</TIMEX> must have reached a certain level of development to proï¬t from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> experiences. Consider, once again, the concept of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œzone,â€</ENAMEX> in which teaching leads development. It tells us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> donâ€™t just grow into school readiness. Rather, they acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for successfully participating in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> life through the assistance of others. This means that readiness is not something we must wait for. Instead, we can cultivate it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school systems</ENAMEX> can work together to ensure that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> takes the next appropriate steps toward mastering the range of capabilities needed for school success.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association for the Education</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Children</ENAMEX> (NAEYC) recommends that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of legal age start kindergarten. It also recommends against school readiness testing as a means for deciding whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> should be admitted to kindergarten, be retained in kindergarten, or enroll in a â€œtransitionâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> rather than a ï¬rst-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class</ENAMEX> after completing kindergarten<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.49</NUMEX> School readiness tests are poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predictors</ENAMEX> of childrenâ€™s future school performance and identify many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unready</ENAMEX> who are quite ready to handle school experiences<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.50</NUMEX> 
As long as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are sensitive to childrenâ€™s diversity and work with small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> within their â€œzones,â€ there is no reason to hold a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> out of kindergarten. Deciding not to enroll a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and opting for an alternative experience is justiï¬able only when the kindergarten environment is so rigid and unaccommodating to individual differences that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> would be frustrated and unhappy and would have an unproductive year. 

My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first grader</ENAMEX> has homework to do several times a week. Should I help her with her homework, and if so, how should I do so?

<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> often express uncertainty about helping their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with homework. They worry that by providing help, they will discourage self-reliance in thinking and problem solving. Vygotskyâ€™s concept of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzoneâ€ underscores</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> acquire the many capacities they need to learn autonomously from the assistance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>, and other more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert adults</ENAMEX>. By collaborating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> on a challenging task, the adult assesses what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> can already do and what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is ready to learn, providing a support system for mastery.
The metaphor of a scaffold, discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 2</ENAMEX>, is an excellent guide for how to help your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with homework. Scaffolding involves varying your assistance to ï¬t the childâ€™s changing competence. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> says, â€œI donâ€™t understand,â€ you can adjust the task, breaking it into smaller parts. You can also provide prompts, hints, and explanations, increasing the amount and directiveness of your guidance until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> makes progress. As you do so, you can assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in analyzing why certain problem-solving approaches work and others do not, encouraging her to come up with ideas for surmounting difficulties. As she starts to apply the strategies derived from your dialogue, you can reduce the intensity of your intervention, letting her take over responsibility for the task.
Too often, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> imagine that their childâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classmates</ENAMEX> can do the homework assignment independently. After all, they say to themselves, why would the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> have assigned it if this werenâ€™t so? This pattern of reasoning leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> down a counterproductive path. â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>?â€ they say to themselves. â€œShe should be able to do the assignment, just like everyone else!â€ But recall that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the same age differ widely in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzones</ENAMEX>.â€ And rooted in the very idea of the â€œzoneâ€ is that learning requires teaching! <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> in our culture frequently are rebuked for seeking help, a response that promotes dependency, helplessness, and retreat from challenge, not competence and autonomy. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> spend a great deal of time helping their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with homeworkâ€”far more than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> also communicate often with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> about how to help their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> learn at his or her best. Rather than being dependent, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> develop into well adjusted, excellent students51â€”at the top in academic achievement in the world. 

When does math become a greater problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> than for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>? What can be done to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> do well in math?

Throughout elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> get better grades in mathâ€”and other academic subjectsâ€”than do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>. At times, school-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> outperform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> on math achievement tests<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,52</NUMEX> but boysâ€™ advantage in math <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isnâ€™t</ENAMEX> clearly evident until secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. A close look at childrenâ€™s performance on speciï¬c test items reveals that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genders</ENAMEX> do equally well in basic math knowledge, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> do better in computational skills. Boysâ€™ advantage appears on tests of math reasoning, primarily on complex word problems and in geometry<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.53</NUMEX>
The cause of boysâ€™ late-appearing math advantage is a matter of controversy. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> believe the difference is rooted in boysâ€™ superior ability to reason about spatial relations. Gender differences in spatial skills are present by elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and persist throughout life<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Young people</ENAMEX> who are good at spatial reasoning are, indeed, better at solving complex math problems<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.55 One</NUMEX> conjecture is that male (androgen) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> may play some role in enhancing boysâ€™ spatial skills. But evidence favoring this idea is inconsistent<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.56</NUMEX>
Although heredity may contribute to boysâ€™ spatial superiority, experience also makes a difference. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who engage in manipulative activities involving spatial relations, such as block play, model <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, and carpentry, do better on spatial reasoning tasks. Also, playing video games that require rapid mental rotation of visual images enhances the spatial test scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> alike<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.57</NUMEX> Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> spend far more time at all these pursuits than do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>.
Furthermore, childrenâ€™s and adolescentsâ€™ attitudes toward math and their belief in their capacity to do well at it affect their math achievement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys</ENAMEX> feel more conï¬dent about their math ability, even when their grades are poorer than girlsâ<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">€™.58</NUMEX> Why might this be so?
Shortly after entering primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> regard math as a boysâ€™ subjectâ€”a stereotype that prompts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> to like math less than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> do. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girls</ENAMEX> also predict poorer math performances for themselves than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> predict for themselves<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.59</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> derive these views from their social surroundings. They listen to what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> say about who is â€œgood at math,â€ and they see more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in math-related careersâ€”from math <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> in the upper school grades to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> in the wider <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
Also, subtle feedback from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> undermines girlsâ€™ conï¬dence in their ability to do well at math. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> believes that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is not very capable at a school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX>, the adult may act surprised when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> succeeds, ascribing good performance to luck by saying something like this: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œGee</ENAMEX>, you did a lot better than I expected!â€ And when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> fails, the adult may explain the failure by referring to mediocre ability: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œYouâ</ENAMEX>€™re not very good at that, are you?â€ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girls</ENAMEX> get much more of this type of feedback than do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, especially in math<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.60</NUMEX> In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> often attribute boysâ€™ poor performance to misbehavior and lack of motivation. â€œIf only youâ€™d listen and try,â€ they say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œyouâ€™d</ENAMEX> do much better.â€
As a result of these messages, too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> come to believe that when they succeed at math, their ability didnâ€™t help them. And after failure, they reason that weak ability, not insufficient effort, was at fault. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who hold these discouraging explanations for their performance often come apart with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anxiety</ENAMEX> when a task is difficult. They say to themselves, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œI canâ€™t</ENAMEX> do this! Itâ€™s too hard!â€ before they have really tried<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.61</NUMEX> Although eventually young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ï¬gure out that effort can compensate for low ability, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> may conclude that mastering complex math is not worth the costâ€”extremely high effort<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.62</NUMEX> So in high school, they retreat from advanced math <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and math-related careers.
Fortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can do much to foster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">girlsâ€™</ENAMEX> self-conï¬dence and achievement in math. Beginning in the preschool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, they can provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> with toys and activities that promote spatial reasoning and scaffold their mastery of those tasks. And they can assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of both genders in interpreting their math successes as due to both effort and ability, in understanding that ability accrues from trying hard, and in taking failure as a sign that more effort and better problem-solving strategies are needed. 
A positive sign is that the gap between boysâ€™ and girlsâ€™ math achievement is declining. In addition, more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are enrolling in advanced math and science <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> in high school, and slowly but steadily, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are entering male-dominated math-related professions<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.63</NUMEX> The more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> hold nonstereotyped values about what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> can and should do, the more likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are to sustain their high elementary-school math and science achievement in secondary school<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.64</NUMEX>

Why do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> lag behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in reading and writing in primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>? Do they catch up later?

Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the school years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> attain higher scores on reading and writing achievement tests and account for a lower percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> referred for remedial reading instruction<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.65</NUMEX> Part of the reason for girlsâ€™ advantage in literacy development is that they undergo a faster rate of physical maturation, believed to promote slightly earlier development of the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex, where language functions are housed for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.66 In addition, many types of developmental problems are more common among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, including speech and language <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>, reading disabilities, and inattention and hyperactivity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boysâ€™</ENAMEX> and girlsâ€™ differing genetic makeups probably underlie these gender differences, which affect reading and writing performance<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.67</NUMEX> 
By secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, girlsâ€™ advantage on tests of general verbal ability is so slight that it is not really meaningful<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.68</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consequently</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> who are free of reading disabilities have the potential to achieve just as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in reading and writing. Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> continue to outperform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Home</ENAMEX> and school experiences contribute, although less is known about them than those that underlie boysâ€™ advantage in mathematics. 
Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> think of math as a masculine subject, they regard reading and writing as feminine subjects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> rate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> as more capable at reading than they rate sonsâ€”beliefs that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> adopt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">69 Furthermore</ENAMEX>, traditional primary-school <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>-directed, whole-class lessons are the major activity, require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to sit still and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concentrate</ENAMEX> for long periods of time on academic tasks that often are irrelevant to their interests. In previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, I indicated that such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> are poorly suited to the learning needs of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> adapt especially poorly to the regimentation of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> because of their generally shorter attention <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spans</ENAMEX>, higher activity levels, and less compliant dispositions.Consequently, they often are targets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> disapproval, which sparks negative attitudes toward school and dampens their enthusiasm for learning<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.70</NUMEX>
In a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> study carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freda Briggs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolchildren</ENAMEX> were asked for their views on school and classroom activities. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 5 and 9 years of age</TIMEX> expressed dissatisfaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and said that their favorite activities were recess and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX>. But in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX>, distinguished by an activity-center curriculum offering opportunities for individual choice, small<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> work, and literacy experiences responsive to childrenâ€™s interests, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> reported strong liking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. And they named reading and writing as their favorite activities. They particularly enjoyed making their own books, based on themes of sports and hobbies<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.71</NUMEX>
Although more evidence is needed to be sure, perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> that create â€œzonesâ€ for learning, with many of the features I described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 6</ENAMEX>, spark sufficient enthusiasm for literacy pursuits among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> that they reduce the well-known gender gap in reading and writing achievement. Finally, the trend for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> to learn to read more slowly than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> is less pronounced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where reading is not stereotyped as feminine but regarded as well suited to the masculine gender role<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.72</NUMEX>

Is learning and development affected if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> becomes less involved or absent after a divorce? 

Divorce is invariably painful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and learning and development can be affectedâ€”temporarily and long term<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.73</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preschool</ENAMEX> and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">school-age children</ENAMEX> are often profoundly upset. Because they have great difficulty grasping the reasons for their parentsâ€™ divorce, they may blame themselves and take the marital breakup as a sign that they could be abandoned by both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. As a result, they may cry and cling, refuse to go to school, and show a drop in enthusiasm for play and learning. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> need extra affection and reassurance along with gentle reminders that their parentsâ€™ separation is permanent. Of all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, preschoolers are most likely to have trouble accepting the reality of divorce and to fantasize that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> will get back together<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.74</NUMEX>
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">school-age children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adolescents</ENAMEX> also react strongly to the end of their parentsâ€™ marriage, particularly when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> conï¬‚ict is high and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> involvement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is low. Around the time of divorce and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to several years after</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> tend to be emotionally volatile, displaying both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> and demandingness, noncompliance, and aggression<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boys</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-custody <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> seem to have the hardest time. Research reveals that before the marital breakup, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> of divorcing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> were impulsive and deï¬antâ€”traits that may have contributed to as well as been caused by their parentsâ€™ marital problems. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> often enter the period of family turmoil surrounding divorce with behavior problems and a reduced capacity to cope with stress<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.76</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Custodial mothers</ENAMEX> tend to have difficulty handling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> on their own. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> show declines in academic achievement during the aftermath of divorce, but school problems are greater for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>.77
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> improve in adjustment by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years after</TIMEX> divorce. Yet for some, emotional distress and poor school performance persist, contributing to lasting problems into adolescence and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adulthood</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> divorced during their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">childhoods</ENAMEX> tend to do less well in terms of educational, vocational, and economic attainment than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> from stable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.78 Regardless of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> remain salient ï¬gures in childrenâ€™s lives, the strongest predictor of good outcomes following divorce is effective parentingâ€”combining warmth with reasonable maturity demands, limiting family conï¬‚ict, and using consistent, nonpunitive discipline<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.79</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fathers</ENAMEX> who remain involved and who use good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rearing techniques contribute greatly to the psychological well-being of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of both genders, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> showing special beneï¬ts<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.80</NUMEX>

I have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> with physical disabilities (cerebral palsy) but whoâ€™s very smart. Will his intellectual growth continue as long as itâ€™s promoted?

Your childâ€™s intellectual growth will deï¬nitely continue as long as you and other important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> in his life promote it. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX> of this book is devoted to the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with deï¬cits and disabilities. Although I donâ€™t discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with cerebral palsy speciï¬cally, the same general principles for fostering continued learning in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> apply to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Childrenâ€”with</ENAMEX> and without disabilitiesâ€”acquire new competencies through dialogues with more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert partners</ENAMEX>, who are sensitive to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is ready to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> and foster it in culturally meaningful activities.
All too often, childrenâ€™s disabilities are viewed as entirely biological, much like an incurable disease. Vygotskyâ€™s theory emphasizes that the most serious consequence of a physical or mental defect is not the biological impairment itself but the disruption it causes in the childâ€™s social relationships. You can help your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> compensate for his physical limitations through social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> and communication aimed at strengthening the higher thought processesâ€”voluntary attention, deliberate memory, concept formation, logical reasoning, problem solving, and imagination. â€œThe mightiness of the mind,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Vygotsky</ENAMEX> wrote, â€œhas virtually no limits.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€81</ENAMEX> 
When cerebral palsy results in speech, hearing, or visual impairments, promoting language proï¬ciency through alternative means is crucial for enhancing development. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> who maximize childrenâ€™s communicative capabilities, through sign language, ï¬nger spelling, special computer technology, and other symbolic innovations, grant them access to the minds of others and to tools for collaborating with more capable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œzonesâ€â€”sure</ENAMEX> routes to realizing their potential.
