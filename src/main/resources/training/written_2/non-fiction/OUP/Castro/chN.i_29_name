<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nacimiento</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nativity Scene</ENAMEX>)
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word nacer, nacimiento is the name for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> nativity scene. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> the creation of nacimientos has been a tradition since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventeenth century</TIMEX>. A nacimiento may resemble a religious altar in that it is an assemblage of many articles and objects, all depicting the recent birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX> in the manger, but a nacimiento can also include other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>-related images, biblical scenes, and possibly artifacts relating to the life experiences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX>. The set of the nacimiento can vary in size from a small table to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, or to the whole front yard of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nacimientos</ENAMEX> will have life-size figures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> and various other biblical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. This custom is not particular to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, and nativity scenes can be found throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</TIMEX>. It is thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Francis of Assisi</ENAMEX> is the saint responsible for much of the veneration of the infant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, and the custom of creating nativity scenes or monuments to the birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> has been going on for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
In private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> nacimientos are usually set up for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first night</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Posadas</ENAMEX>, which starts on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 16</TIMEX> and continues until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 24</TIMEX>. A nacimiento is left in place until <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El D√≠a de los Reyes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epiphany</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 6</TIMEX>, when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> arrive to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naranja Dulce</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sweet Orange</ENAMEX>)
A very popular old children‚Äôs game and song frequently recited in novels and poems. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> form a circle with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and they sing this song:
Naranja dulce
Lim√≥n partido
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√°me un</ENAMEX> abrazo
Que yo te pido.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX> fueran falsos
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Mis juramentos,</ENAMEX>
En algun d√≠a se olvidaran.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweet</ENAMEX> orange
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sliced lemon</ENAMEX>
Give me a hug
That I ask of you.
If my promises were false
Someday they will be forgotten.)
After this verse is sung, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> chooses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that is forming the circle and embraces that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> picked enters the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> moves out. While this is going on they keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> moving around, and clapping hands, they sing the following verse to a fast beat:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toca la Marcha</ENAMEX>
Mi pecho llora
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> adi√≥s Se√±ora
Yo ya me voy.
(Play the march
My breast [heart] cries
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good-bye my Lady</ENAMEX>
I am leaving.)
For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations mothers</ENAMEX> have sung this little verse to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> as they lull them to sleep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Girls</ENAMEX> play this game in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> also, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> as the center <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inez Cardozo-Freeman</ENAMEX> interprets as a portrayal of betrayal and abandonment preparing little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> for marriage.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico Folklore</ENAMEX>
Of all the areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> have settled and lived, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Mexico‚Äôs</ENAMEX> culture and folklore that has been historically studied the most. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aurelio M. Espinosa</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispano</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> heritage born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>) to conduct research into the culture and language of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Mexicans</ENAMEX>. His most important work was published during the early part of the nineteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1910‚Äì1916</NUMEX>, with a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of American Folklore</ENAMEX>. He collected folktales, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> songs, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">proverbs, superstitions</ENAMEX>, riddles, children‚Äôs games, and much more. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> who were trained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espinosa</ENAMEX> and who later continued folkloric work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Campa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan B. Rael</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espinosa‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Manuel Espinosa</ENAMEX>, who published <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish Folk</ENAMEX>-tales from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rael</ENAMEX> published <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuentos Espa√±oles de Colorado y Nuevo Mejico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>, which is considered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am√©rico Paredes</ENAMEX> to be one of the best collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> folk narrative. Campa‚Äôs work includes collections of folk poetry, riddles, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> songs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> drama from the late nineteenth and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early twentieth centuries</TIMEX>, published mostly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s and 1950s</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Donald Robb</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1892‚Äì1989</ENAMEX>) collected folk songs throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1950s</ENAMEX> using wire recorders. He came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New Mexico</ENAMEX> as chair of the music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>. He was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> and educator but always had an interest in folk music. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Donald Robb Archive</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Music</ENAMEX> is located at the university‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. His <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> books on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> Folk Songs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic Folk</ENAMEX> Music of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Self Portrait of a People</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have always been involved in creative and artistic work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> even up until contemporary times. Although there have been many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> about the santeros (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>-carvers, tinsmiths, and other male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, very little has been written about the work accomplished by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> have created religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">santos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>), retablos (religious paintings), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw appliqu√© crosses</ENAMEX>, and tinwork. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women wove</ENAMEX> blankets and embroidered colchas (blankets). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitewashing</ENAMEX> and plastering of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> have always been women‚Äôs work. Those who do it are called enjarradoras, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> they continue this work, also making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adobe hornos</ENAMEX> (ovens) and fireplaces for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Folk Art</ENAMEX> located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Fe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marianne Stoller</ENAMEX> writes of the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women artists</ENAMEX> and why they have been left out of history.
Several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who descended from the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> of the region wrote personal life histories that incorporated the traditional way of life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of the late nineteenth and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early twentieth centuries</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fabiola Cabeza de Baca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Otero-Warren</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleofas Jaramillo</ENAMEX> each produced several books that present the folklore, rituals, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Mexicans</ENAMEX>. Rebolledo discusses how these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> used their writings as ‚Äúnarrative strategies of resistance‚Äù because they saw their culture and way of life slowly eroding away and being assimilated by a dominant and foreign culture. Because they all came from upper-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, they were educated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> traditions and language and consequently ignored the mestizo (mixed-race) and indigenous aspects of the culture, often depicting their past in romantic pastoral terms. Nevertheless, they all wrote of the loss of land and loss of culture, and sought to preserve the folklore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, and stories of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX>, close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, and those who worked for them.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penitentes</ENAMEX>, the ancient religious brotherhood, have attracted much research and been scrutinized by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Cordova</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henderson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sprott</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weigle</ENAMEX> have conducted the most perceptive and sensitive writing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penitentes</ENAMEX>. The popular arts of colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, particularly the santos and santeros, have received a lot of attention by such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Boyd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marta Weigle</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Wroth</ENAMEX>.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> Chicano <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> have collected folklore from their ancestors and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasario Garcia</ENAMEX> has published several collections depicting the way of life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio Puerco Valley</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudolfo Anaya</ENAMEX> has written several children‚Äôs books that bring forth the folklore of the region. Because of its long history <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> will always be a bountiful reservoir for the serious folklorist.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nichos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niches</ENAMEX>)
A nicho is a nook or niche built into a wall that is similar to a shelf inside of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. It can be as small as <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six inches</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as high as one</NUMEX> foot or even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> feet. Anything can be placed in a nicho, from books to knickknacks, but the usual purpose is to house a holy picture or statue of a saint. Consequently in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> homes the word carries almost the same meaning as altar or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>. A nicho decorated with votive candles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> becomes the site for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> devotional prayers. Nichos are also constructed as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard shrines</ENAMEX> to house a favorite saint or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> or another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Yard shrines</ENAMEX> that incorporate a nicho are set up as a place of worship in the yard to commemorate a deceased relative or as a fulfillment of a vow. In some parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> these outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> are also called grutas, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúgrottos,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> words are often used interchangeably. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery shrine</ENAMEX> may also incorporate a nicho or a gruta. Since a gruta is primarily outdoors it can be constructed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery shrine</ENAMEX>. Nichos that are found in front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> may be constructed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, and may appear as a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, chapel-shaped, or as a small <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>. A wrought-iron door may be installed for privacy or to prevent vandalism. Yard nichos can vary in size from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foot to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six or eight feet</NUMEX> high. Invariably they are decorated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and are often painted in pastel colors.
