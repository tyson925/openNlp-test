<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachuco Cross</ENAMEX>
A design in the form of a small cross that is tattooed on the left hand, between the thumb and forefinger, with lines, or dashes, radiating out from it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Carpenter Barker</ENAMEX> states that it must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> rays, or lines, that radiate from the cross. It is a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> and has been traced to the era of the pachucos (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1940s</NUMEX> urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>), hence its name. It is also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cruz del</ENAMEX> barrio (cross from the neighborhood) and has been found throughout major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. Tattoos of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> images have always been popular among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, and the custom of tattooing images of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX>, crucifixes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madonnas</ENAMEX> has a long history. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> cut a cross into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris</ENAMEX>-tian converts on the hand a little above the wrist. Some social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> believe that the pachuco cross was meant to symbolize violence and membership in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>. But it is known that it was used as an initiation ritual among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, to show solidarity and allegiance to a particular barrio. In describing the tattooed cross <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haldeen Braddy</ENAMEX> is of the opinion that each ray jetting out from the cross represented a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-month</TIMEX> stay in jail. In his view, pachucos liked to stay in the jaula (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>) so that they could ‚Äúaccumulate these ‚Äòrays‚Äô as souvenirs of their imprisonment‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">142</NUMEX>). There is no evidence to support this speculation.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachucos</ENAMEX> (-as) (1940s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Youth</ENAMEX>)
A name adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> to designate those who make up a fascinating urban subculture, detached from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> culture and from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> urban life also. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appearance of pachucos was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Paso‚ÄìJu√°rez</ENAMEX> area during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1930s</TIMEX>. It is thought the word pachuco was a colloquial way of referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX> was referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del</ENAMEX> pachuco. Sometimes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> considered a pachuco was called a chuco. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haldeen Braddy</ENAMEX> discusses the origin of the word pachuco, providing several theories. One is that the pachucos of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1930s</NUMEX> came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachuca</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hidalgo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. He also pre-sents the definition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Diccionario General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Americanismos</ENAMEX>, stating that pachuca is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-card poker hand in which all the cards are of different suits, or in other words, a poker hand with no value, a losing hand. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braddy</ENAMEX> believes this well describes the pachucos of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>). The other theory is that pachuco comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Nahuatl</ENAMEX> word pachtli, which refers to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass like hay</ENAMEX> that grows parasitically on <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
Pachucos were identifiable by their clothing, hairstyles, and a distinct language with its own vocabulary. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> wore ‚Äúzoot suits,‚Äù that is, pegged pants, long coats with padded shoulders, and pancake hats. Their hair was worn long and slicked back with a ducktail effect. Some also wore a long chain hanging from their pants, well displayed and connected to a belt. Pachucas were the girlfriends of the pachucos, but they also had a dress style all their own. They wore short, very tight skirts, with their hair high and long. Makeup was heavy, especially around the eyes. Supposedly they were very streetwise and liked to hang out with their pachuco <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriends</ENAMEX>.
Large numbers of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>, speaking the pachuco argot, settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1940s</TIMEX>, and it was there that they became recognized as an identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and considered to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang members</ENAMEX>. Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who relocated and settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, even for short periods of time, upon returning home to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, would spread the pachuco beliefs and jargon to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. In this way pachuquesmo, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> subculture, became known throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>.
The pachuco speech, a combination of English and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, also called cal√≥, was a fascinating fusion drawing from many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic sources</ENAMEX>. Cal√≥ was originally the language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsies</ENAMEX>, or a dialect of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> showing traces of many languages acquired by the gypsies throughout their world wanderings. The pachuco argot utilized several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">linguistic sources</ENAMEX> in developing a vocabulary or jargon. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> were southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, the older archaic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> slang, standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>, and also words invented by the pachucos themselves. The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment, and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Carpenter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barker</ENAMEX> pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated, from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">7-X</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> who first met in the neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eighth Streets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Campa</ENAMEX> believes that pachucos originated as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">linguistic group</ENAMEX> first and had no distinctive dress style. That came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resources.
Expressions and vocabulary used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> today come from the pachuco argot of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>. For example, such words as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">√≥rale</NUMEX> (what‚Äôs happening, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.K.</ENAMEX>), bato (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, as in bato loco), califas (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> te wuacho (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I‚</ENAMEX>Äôll be seeing you), and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la pinta</ENAMEX> (jail/<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>) have been used for generations. The film <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoot Suit</ENAMEX>, written and directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Valdez</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, depicts the dress, language, and problems of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> youth and especially pachucos in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>.
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> a caricature of the pachuco was created for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tin Tan</ENAMEX>, whose real name was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germ√°n Vald√©z</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1919‚Äì1973</ENAMEX>). He was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer</ENAMEX> who dressed as a stereotypical pachuco and zoot-suiter. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tin Tan</ENAMEX> made several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> films portraying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pocho</ENAMEX> who code-switches between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and speaks cal√≥.
The pachuco was disdained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, and likewise in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> by the media and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Octavio Paz</ENAMEX>, much quoted, disparagingly discusses the phenomenon of the pachuco in his book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Labyrinth of Solitude</ENAMEX>, published in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>. Although almost any urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chicano</ENAMEX> who was young in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> was affected by the style and language of the pachuco, the stereotypic pachuco was often associated with violence and deviancy. The zoot-suit riots of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX> are held up as the epitome of the pachuco experience, totally disregarding previous and later experiences. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfredo Mirand√©</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúThe pachuco</ENAMEX> has been an especially visible symbol of cultural autonomy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. His distinctive dress, demeanor, mannerism, and language not only express his manhood but set him off culturally from the dominant society. To be a chuco is to be proud, dignified, and to uphold one‚Äôs personal integrity as well as the honor and integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. It is at once an affirmation of one‚Äôs manhood and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">one‚Äôs culture‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">179‚Äì180</NUMEX>). The pachuco is the precursor to the bato loco, the cholo, and the low rider of more contemporary times.
The pachuca was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> of the pachuco of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> but also the home-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> archetype that comes together in the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chicana</ENAMEX> growing up in an urban ghettoized environment. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>, pachucas were the girlfriends of or those who hung around with pachucos. They developed their own style of dress, wearing very tight short skirts and sweaters and doing their hair in a pompadour style. Their behavior was loud and brash: they smoked cigarettes in public, wore lots of eye makeup, and supposedly were quick to fight. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachucas</ENAMEX> knew the vernacular of the times, speaking pachuco and scandalizing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. They were not necessarily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang members</ENAMEX>, but they can be considered the precursors of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> cholas.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palomilla</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Friends</ENAMEX>)
A term used primarily in south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s and 1950s</TIMEX> to describe an informal group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that hung around together. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paloma</ENAMEX> means ‚Äúdove,‚Äù so a palomilla is a flock of doves. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> rarely hears the expression <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, but it is occasionally used in literature, such as the short stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Suarez</ENAMEX>. A palomilla would be one‚Äôs peer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, or a very close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, but not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>. Consisting of a core of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, with a few fringe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, a palomilla was an important socialization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> that provided a safe space for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to joke and express themselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Rubel</ENAMEX> writes about the supportive social environment provided by the palomilla of young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coming-of-age Chicanos</ENAMEX> in the barrio of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Lots</ENAMEX> in south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Spielberg</ENAMEX> describes the quick wit and aggressive bilingual humor found among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of his palomilla during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>, and how their jostling and jesting allowed for the full bloom of each person‚Äôs personality.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papel Picado</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cut Tissue Paper</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> and final product of cutting out intricate designs and patterns on sheets of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> who do this work have been doing it for several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> and can cut through fifty or more sheets at a time. A pattern is made and used as the top sheet while the outline design is cut out with different-sized chisels. Most often the small banner-sized sheets are made to decorate altars and nacimientos (nativity scenes), or for such celebrations as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinco de Mayo</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Diez y Seis de Septiembre</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sixteenth</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> are often decorated with streams of colorful papel picado. Some of the cutout designs are scenes related to specific holidays, such as skeletons for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D√≠a de los Muertos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Day of the Dead</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, floral patterns, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> flag, and other patriotic scenes. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, experienced paper cutters can make large wall hangings and tablecloths out of papel picado. Papel picado is often taught in public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, although on the small <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight-by-eleven-inch</NUMEX> paper.

Paredes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am√©rico</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1915‚Äì1999</ENAMEX>)
Considered the foremost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am√©rico Paredes</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> emeritus of English and anthropology at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>. His classic work, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">With His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero</ENAMEX>, first published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, has become a standard work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> studies and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> folklore. A whole generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> regard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paredes</ENAMEX> as their intellectual role model and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX>, and his original research on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore engendered a new wave of scholarship and academic achievements.
As a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paredes</ENAMEX> was always interested in music, corridos (ballads), and singing. His early published scholarship focused on ballads and ballad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border, and through this research he developed a theory about the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> to an encroaching foreign culture, the loss of political and economic power, feelings of social marginality, and the resulting conflict of cultures all contributed to the creation of folklore in the form of legends, jokes, and songs by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. His research and publications encompass various disciplines from anthropology to literature to social history.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Am√©rico Paredes</ENAMEX> was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brownsville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 3, 1915</TIMEX>. He attended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brownsville Junior College</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1930s</TIMEX>, earning an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.A.</ENAMEX> degree in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> he joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>, wrote for the military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stripes</ENAMEX>, and worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX>. Returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, he earned a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.</ENAMEX> degree from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.A.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>, and a Ph.D. in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX>.
The distinguishing feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paredes‚</ENAMEX>Äôs scholarship has been his humanistic approach to conducting research. Besides knowing and studying his own culture and ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, he was able to bring another consciousness to the study of folklore in general and to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> folklore in particular. He taught that the examination of a cultural or folkloric phenomenon cannot be divorced from the social context in which it is performed or expressed. Before the publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paredes‚</ENAMEX>Äôs work, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore collected was classified, published, and placed on a library shelf. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paredes‚Äôs</ENAMEX> research emphasized the importance of the informant‚Äôs culture, and the social setting and history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of the informant. It was in his book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">With His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paredes</ENAMEX> proposed his theory of the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore through a process of cultural conflict generated by the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> culture and values into south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1800s</TIMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> have dedicated their books to him, and the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√°n</ENAMEX> devoted a double-issue volume to him in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>. Besides publishing over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> articles in academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX>, he was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of American Folklore</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968 to 1973</TIMEX> and published <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Folktales of Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> and A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> Cancionero: Folksongs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Border</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>.
Besides his scholarly writings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paredes</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelist</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Pastores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shepherds‚Äô Play</ENAMEX>)
A religious medieval nativity folk play. Also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Pastorela</ENAMEX>, the complete title of this folk drama is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Coloquio de los Pastores</ENAMEX>, and it is written in verse and performed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</TIMEX>. It is an ancient mystery play, brought to the New World by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Franciscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, and is performed throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> production, it is performed for entertainment, but it is also a religious presentation that is maintaining a long tradition. The full title means ‚Äúthe dialogue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and it is an interpretation of the dialogue and reaction the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> may have had when they learned of the birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX>. It narrates the story of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> who are visited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael the Archangel</ENAMEX> who informs them of the birth of the infant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> and urges them to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bel√©n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX>). Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> decide what to do, they are visited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucifer</ENAMEX>, who is angry about the birth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucifer</ENAMEX> tries to challenge the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael the Archangel</ENAMEX> returns just in time to defeat him. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> then continue on their journey to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> bringing gifts for the infant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the play is formulaic, and so the sequence of acts can be rearranged into many different patterns, with jokes, songs, speeches, and other events added at different points. The underlying story of the drama is the universal battle between good and evil. It has evolved from the literature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteenth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and the indigenous traditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and for this reason the play has provided a political format for the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 400 years</TIMEX>.
Because of its ancient history there are many variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Pastores</ENAMEX>, and several versions have developed a comic dialogue between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucifer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuchar√≥n, Bartolo</ENAMEX>, and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bato</ENAMEX>, as in bato loco (crazy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>), a phrase of contemporary usage among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Variants of this play have been collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, and it has been performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixteenth century</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Pastores</ENAMEX> at Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe Church</ENAMEX> as been ongoing since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Flores</ENAMEX>, both as an ethnographer and as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer</ENAMEX>, presents a thorough analysis of the historical conditions that continue to provide an environment for the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Pastores</ENAMEX> as both ritual and drama. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Teatro Campesino</ENAMEX> produced a video film of their production of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Pastores</ENAMEX> titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Pastorela‚ÄîThe Shepherds‚Äô Tale</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Urdemalas</ENAMEX>
Also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro di Urdemales</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Ordimales</ENAMEX>, meaning ‚ÄúPeter of the holy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> font,‚Äù he is a rogue folk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of tales to his name. This trickster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is known throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spanish-speaking world</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. He is the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">picaro</ENAMEX> (rogue), who incorporates <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúthree ancient literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>, the wanderer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX>, and the have-not,‚Äù according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio Guillen</ENAMEX>. He is the trickster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> who is constantly dissatisfied, always wanting more, yet is always outwitting everyone and acting as the social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> along the way. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Urdemalas</ENAMEX> lives by his wit, has no shame, and at different times makes a pact with the devil, God, the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX>. Tales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Urdemalas</ENAMEX> collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aurelio M. Espinosa</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> were published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of American Folklore</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ram√≥n Laval</ENAMEX> gives a brief literary history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Urdemalas</ENAMEX> and publishes a small series of tales collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chile</ENAMEX> in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cervantes</ENAMEX> wrote a play about him in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1615</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Comedia Famosa de Pedro de Urdemalas</ENAMEX>, so we know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Urdemalas</ENAMEX> was already a folkloric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventeenth century</TIMEX>. Wardropper <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúPedro de Urdemalas</ENAMEX> is a shadowy, even elusive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> in the oral tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folktales</ENAMEX>. Because these tales were not‚Äîas far as we know‚Äîcollected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and because, like ballads and songs, they must have been subject to endless variation and mutual interference, we cannot now know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Urdemalas</ENAMEX> who endeared himself to the folk‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">218</ENAMEX>). But it is clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro de Urdemalas</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispano</ENAMEX> precursor to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Cacahuate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> pelado, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tin Tan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cantinflas</ENAMEX>, and an antecedent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> joking behavior.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Pelado</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Plucked One</ENAMEX>)
Literally, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúplucked,‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúbald,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù el pelado</ENAMEX> was a designation used for a clownish performer, an improvised character type developed by performing theater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. Also known as peladito, this comic hobo is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underdog</ENAMEX>, a nobody who is criticized and made fun of by the whole world. The pelado was a verbal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> who, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Ramos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúhas</ENAMEX> created a dialect of his own, a diction which abounds in ordinary words, but he gives these words a new meaning.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> His terminology abounds in sexual allusion‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>). Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carpas</ENAMEX> (tent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>) featured pelado or peladito <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, and the agringado (anglicized) and the pocho (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>) were special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of his comic wit and satire. Beloved by working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>, the peladito, using cal√≥ (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX>) and pochismos (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americanisms</ENAMEX>), particularly poked fun at the acculturation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> who couldn‚Äôt speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> and pointed out to them <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>. Similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Chaplin</ENAMEX>, and later developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cantinflas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> pelado was a homeless type who in dialogue could state the unthinkable and mock everything and everybody. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, who may not have known the appellation pelado, nonetheless became familiar with the comic vagabond through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> films. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Teatro Campesino</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Farmworkers‚Äô Theater</ENAMEX>) effectively used this character type in skits and actos (dramas) and succeeded in intensifying, with humor, the serious social issues presented in their performances.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Penitentes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Penitents</ENAMEX>)
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> fraternal order of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, formally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Fraternidad Piadosa de Nuestro Padre de Jesus Nazare√±o</ENAMEX>, or informally as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Penitentes</ENAMEX>. This lay religious society related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic Church</ENAMEX> is still found in rural northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>. Originally it was organized for religious observances and practices, including pious prayer and bodily penance, but the society eventually became very important in providing mutual aid to the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Penitentes</ENAMEX> cared for the sick, arranged funerals, and conducted the religious rituals associated with wakes. Their social role in contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> is not as pronounced but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moradas</ENAMEX> still remain active.
Their primary religious ceremonies commemorated the passion and death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX>, during the celebrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Semana Santa, ‚ÄúHoly Week</ENAMEX>.‚Äù It is speculated that the starting date of the brotherhood is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">somewhere between 1790 and 1810</NUMEX>. The origins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Penitentes</ENAMEX> have been debated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, but it is likely they were heavily influenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> Third Order, who were the friars in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> separated from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Penitentes</ENAMEX> became a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> because there were too few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> to oversee the religious life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early nineteenth century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> chapters governed themselves without benefit of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. Consequently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Penitentes</ENAMEX> had strong influences in conserving the language and culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Americans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. Membership consisted of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between thirty and fifty</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult men</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> (called moradas) and were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, called hermanos disciplantes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> who discipline), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, called hermanos de luz (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> of light). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early twentieth century</TIMEX> the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> had become secret <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> with restricted membership.
Journalism about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Hermanos Penitentes</ENAMEX> has been sensationalistic, with lengthy descriptions of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semana Santa</ENAMEX> rituals, especially when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo Americans</ENAMEX> migrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> during the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX>. Their custom of self-punishment, in the form of flagellation during the Holy <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Week</ENAMEX> ceremonies, aroused much interest and was reported widely in many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>. The most sensitive and nonjudgmental writing and research have been conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Cordova</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henderson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sprott</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weigle</ENAMEX>. A worthy, contemporary (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1970‚Äì1986</ENAMEX>), descriptive account of the ritual ceremonies associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Week</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cordova</ENAMEX> can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Briggs</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>).

Pichilingis are similar to duendes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goblins</ENAMEX>) and are possibly the indigenous version of a duende, and have only been found in the folklore literature of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. Duendes are very common in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> folktales, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still believe in them.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pil√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonus</ENAMEX>)
A custom, often expressed only after it occurs, of giving a little extra when making a transaction or closing a bargain. For instance, when buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> may add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> extra piece, de pil√≥n, to surprise and make a child happy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bourke</ENAMEX> writes about an ancient custom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> still used in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX>: a merchant kept a tin cylinder for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX>, and after each purchase he‚Äôd drop a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean</ENAMEX> into it. After the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen or eighteen</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> was given <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six cents</NUMEX> in money or goods. This was the pil√≥n, a type of dividend given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">client</ENAMEX> for purchasing from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX>.
The phrase de pil√≥n is used when referring to the occurrence of an unplanned episode or accident. In narrating a personal story with an unhappy ending, an individual might add, ‚ÄúY de pil√≥n me ca√≠‚Äù (and to top it off, I fell down). Although it is not found in common usage among contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, many will remember how their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> used this expression. The word has several meanings, including <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúa heap of stuff,‚Äù such as a heap of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX>, a heap of mortar, a heap of something, but it also means a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lump</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. In her personal memoir <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Place</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria Lopez-Stoppard</ENAMEX> has a delightful de-scription of the use of pil√≥n during her childhood. Thus de pil√≥n may express something positive, or something unexpectedly negative.

Pi√±atas
A colorfully decorated clay pot or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">papier-m√¢ch√</NUMEX>© figure filled with toys and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candies</ENAMEX>, confetti, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> favors that is brought to celebrations such as birthdays, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> festivities, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. Often it is decorated as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>, such as a burro or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>, but it can also be a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> or a puppet. The size varies from small to very large. Pi√±atas have traditionally been a part of birthday and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> celebrations, but are now also brought out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other holidays</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> a pi√±ata was always broken on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</TIMEX>, especially among the poorer classes, so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> would receive small inexpensive gifts from the pi√±ata. The real <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> gifts were not presented until <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D√≠a de los Reyes</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 6</TIMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epiphany</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> calendar.
A game is made of breaking the pi√±ata, and a song accompanies the game. The pi√±ata is hung from a tree, with a long rope that is manipulated by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>, who is able to move the pi√±ata up and down, so it won‚Äôt be broken too quickly. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is blindfolded, twirled around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, handed a bat, and led to the pi√±ata. Everyone will usually have a turn or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, and finally the manipulator allows someone to break it. The candy and prizes fall to the ground and everyone jumps to grab some.
The custom of breaking a pi√±ata during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> celebrations was introduced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Augustine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventeenth century</TIMEX>. Later the custom of celebrating <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Masses</ENAMEX> evolved into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Posadas</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> pageant). The pi√±ata was considered to be a symbol of evil, with the clay pot representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satan</ENAMEX> or his spirit and the colorful decorations serving to tempt humanity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candies</ENAMEX> and goodies inside the pi√±ata were the unknown pleasures that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satan</ENAMEX> held out to attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. The blindfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was supposed to represent innocence and faith, which must be blind to combat the evil spirit. The breaking of the pi√±ata symbolized the struggle that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> must sustain to destroy evil and receive the gifts and pleasures of God (the candy).
The word pi√±ata derives from the verb api√±ar, which means to cram, tie, or join together. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> pignattas were hung from the ceilings during masquerade balls. It is accepted that there is an oriental influence, since pi√±atas are always decorated with colorful crepe paper. It is thought pi√±atas originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and were brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sicily</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> and to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pintos</ENAMEX> (-as) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prisoners</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinto</ENAMEX> is a term used for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> and also for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX>. A pinto is a male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>, a pinta a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Pinta</ENAMEX>, referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, is believed to come from the word penitenciaria, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúpenitentiary.‚Äù Other common words for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> are bote, meaning ‚Äúcan,‚Äù and corre, which is short for ‚Äúcorrectional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>,‚Äù referring specifically to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúJoint‚Äù</ENAMEX> is another word frequently used to mean <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>.
There has been a lot of sociological literature written about the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> as a means of surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">incarceration</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The media, including <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX>, has done stories about the activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mafia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Familia</ENAMEX>. Often ignored is the subculture of the pinto experience that is exhibited in behavior, art expression, and published poetry. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX> several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> devoted whole issues to literature and art by pintos, always referring to it as pinto art and pinto poetry. A combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and prison cultural values dictates the behavior of pintos inside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> and out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. Chicano <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> have a strong sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and community and feel they are constantly being watched by their barrio, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and their home-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> peer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">convicts</ENAMEX> have little education, speak primarily in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, and have a strong sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> nationalism. Regardless of place of birth, mexicanismo and machismo are a very important part of being a pinto. Ex-pintos are often identifiable by their mannerisms, gestures, language, haircuts, and dress. They are usually extremely clean and well groomed, have very short hair, wear well-pressed pants, and are in excellent physical shape. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> world pintos have established a well-defined and -structured social environment, which they carry to the outside world when released. In discussing the film <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American Me</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa Linda Fregoso</ENAMEX> states that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward James Olmos</ENAMEX> depicts extremely well the expressive behavior of pintos both in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> and outside. In her words, ‚ÄúBesides rendering a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> pinto presence in the rhythms of speech, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santana</ENAMEX> [the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>] represents it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stylized</ENAMEX> walk and prose of a pinto, a stance honed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX> behind <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> walls or in the barrios of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East L.A.‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX>).
The pinto experience is a subculture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> experience. Because of the low socioeconomic status of a large percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and the lack of equal opportunities in education and employment, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have been inadvertently introduced to this subculture. A special issue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Colores</ENAMEX>, vol. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, was devoted to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúLos <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pintos de America</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and the issue was published as a separate monograph in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pajarito Publications</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Female Chicana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> also undergo the pinta experience, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Letticia Galindo</ENAMEX>, has written about the specialized language use and street experiences of pachucas, cholas, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang members</ENAMEX>, and female prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insignias</ENAMEX>)
The word placa means ‚Äúan insignia of an order,‚Äù and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> it also means the license plates of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. But within cholo and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth gang</ENAMEX> culture it refers to the sign and name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> as it appears on the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the barrios of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. What may appear as graffiti is actually the placa of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, or of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>. Where the placa appears signifies that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> as belonging to that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>, and it may also serve as a challenge to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX>. The use of public walls for asserting a fraternal identity is really an ancient tradition, and within <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture it can be traced back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the 1930s</TIMEX>. Chicano <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> culture uses plaqueasos as a system for conveying information about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> socialization <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> placa is written over by the placa of another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>, it is accepted as a challenge to a confrontation.
A placa also refers to the individual name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang member</ENAMEX>. Nicknames are very common among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, but a placa is specifically a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>-related name and often very well describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> as perceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang members</ENAMEX>. Names, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúSad Girl</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚ÄúDiablo‚Äù</ENAMEX> (devil), <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúJoker,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMalo‚Äù</ENAMEX> (bad) could be names used within a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX>, and may signify sadness, wildness, or craziness. Sometimes the writing of names on walls is referred to as plaqueasos, or in contemporary terms, ‚Äúbarrio calligraphy.‚Äù In more recent times the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> who writes on walls has been called a tagger, and the art of writing is tagging. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> taggers use a stylized medieval writing, such as Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> forms.
Sanchez-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tranquilino</ENAMEX> has analyzed the displacement of graffiti by murals in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicano communities</ENAMEX> and finds that murals can be an extension of the barrio calligraphy rather than an attempt to control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gang vandalism</ENAMEX>, as is sometimes assumed.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pochismos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americanisms</ENAMEX>)
A term that describes the use of English expressions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, or Americanisms interjected into conversations when speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. Sometimes this kind of speech is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spanglish</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano Spanish</ENAMEX>, or just pocho talk. Examples of some pochismos are words such as parkear, meaning to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>), and wachar, meaning to watch (<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay te wacho</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúI‚Äôll</ENAMEX> see you‚Äù), also spelled guachate, meaning ‚Äúwatch out.‚Äù Other simpler examples are dona for doughnut, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> dompe for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dump</ENAMEX>, troque for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>, and yarda for yard. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Pe√±a</ENAMEX> the word jait√≥n, meaning ‚Äúsnobbish,‚Äù evolved from the words ‚Äúhigh tone‚Äù when one was discussing music. It came to be used to mean pretentious high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, as in ‚Äúse crea muy jaitona‚Äù (she thinks she‚Äôs real high-class), but at the same time it can mean that one has elegance or style.
Various dictionaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chicano Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slang</ENAMEX> have been compiled that list many other pochismos. Chicano novelists and poets have consciously incorporated the use of pochismos in literary works to reinforce the precarious cultural and linguistic status of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocho</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>)
A pocho is a term used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to describe a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> heritage born and raised in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. It is meant to describe a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who may not be fully fluent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúMexican enough,‚Äù culturally and linguistically. The word can also mean <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúdiscolored,‚Äù ‚Äútruncated,‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúsmall.‚Äù It has been adopted by some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> to describe and ridicule themselves as they survive within an antagonistic and discriminatory environment. The word became more nationally known in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX> with the publication of the novel Pocho by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Antonio Villarreal</ENAMEX>, which depicted the coming-of-age of a Chicano growing up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara Valley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> like to call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX> pocho, ridiculing their sometimes poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and their lack of knowledge about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> customs. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> who have spent time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and have acquired the mannerisms, values, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language may be considered pochos because they‚Äôve become agringados (anglicized). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s and 1960s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> produced several films depicting the lives of pochos, from both sides of the border, but emphasizing the importance of maintaining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mexi-canidad</ENAMEX>. Titles of some of these films are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Soy Mexicano de Ac√° de Este Lado</ENAMEX> (I Am a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Side</ENAMEX>) (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Desarraigados</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Uprooted</ENAMEX>) (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©xico de Mi Coraz√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mexico of My Heart</ENAMEX>) (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Pocho</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Half Mexican</ENAMEX>) (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>).
As with the word cholo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> have attempted to find the origin of the use of the word pocho in reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>. In his autobiography, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Barrio Boy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernesto Galarza</ENAMEX> writes about the pochos he found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second decade</TIMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twentieth century</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúThey</ENAMEX> had learned to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of sorts and could still speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, also of sorts.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> Concerning the pochos, the chicanos suspected that they considered themselves too good for the barrio but were not, for some reason, good enough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</NUMEX>).
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lalo Lopez</ENAMEX> has created a comic industry based on pocho caricatures that includes a comic strip, political cartoons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocho Productions</ENAMEX>, an Internet web page, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocho Magazine</ENAMEX>, a political satire zine, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a calendar</TIMEX>. He refers to a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> calendar as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pochteca</ENAMEX> calendar, which features wisdom from the ‚Äúwise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> ancestors of the modern day <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pocha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocho</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The whole <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> is referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pocholandia</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> who does not speak fluent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> may be said to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">pocho Spanish</ENAMEX>, but the reverse is never stated about a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> who cannot speak fluent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> words that have become altered by the opposite language, through cultural contact, are called pochismos. Some examples of pochismos are yonque for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äújunk,‚Äù tichar for ‚Äúto teach,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and carro for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcar</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Posadas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmas Pageant</ENAMEX>)
A tradition marking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the Christmas season</TIMEX> with the dramatization of the search for lodging in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>. It always includes a procession with singing and music and starts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine days</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>. The story, in the form of a novena (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-days devotion), is based on the gospel of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Luke</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine consecutive nights</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">la Noche Buena</ENAMEX> (the good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">los</ENAMEX> peregrinos (the pilgrims) representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> visit a different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each night</TIMEX>, reenacting the search for an inn by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Los</ENAMEX> mesoneros, those who portray the innkeepers, keep refusing them lodging. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Los</ENAMEX> peregrinos form a procession, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and angels hand-carry the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Family</ENAMEX>. When they arrive at a home they ask for shelter and sing carols. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Posadas</ENAMEX> occurs from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 16 through December 24</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are opened to the pilgrims and food and drink are offered after the peregrinos have been denied lodging. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> will have a nativity scene, a nacimiento, set up for the prayers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX>. An important tradition of these festivities is the pi√±ata that is brought out and broken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. There is evidence that pi√±atas originated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this Christmas</TIMEX> celebration.
Posadas are still held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Some are organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church groups</ENAMEX>, but recently others have been organized for commercial purposes by city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. The reenactment of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Posadas</ENAMEX> is an ancient tradition that can be traced back to the early conquest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and to the christianization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Augustine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>. They originated in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Augustin Acolman</ENAMEX> located near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teotihuac√°n.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aztecs</ENAMEX> celebrated the birth of their god <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huitzilopochtli</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX>, and celebrations were held all of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX> in every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. This occurred about the same time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> celebrated the birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Augustine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> saw the similarity between these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> celebrations and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas</TIMEX> festivities and chose this opportunity to teach the new religion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX>. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> were celebrating the birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huitzilopochtli</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> reenacted the pilgrimage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> journeys symbolize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nine months</TIMEX> of pregnancy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Christmas Masses</ENAMEX>, as they were called, were celebrated in the convents and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, but eventually were moved to the haciendas, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX>, and finally to the neighborhoods. The celebrations ended with firecrackers and the breaking of a pi√±ata. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> reenact this pilgrimage for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> with a procession winding through city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> comes out for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Posadas</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, a posada is held during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fiesta de las Luminarias</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonfires</ENAMEX>) that includes a procession on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paso del Rio</ENAMEX> (river pass).
