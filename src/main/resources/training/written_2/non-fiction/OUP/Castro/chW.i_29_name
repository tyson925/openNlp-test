<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedding Customs</ENAMEX>
Chicano wedding rituals vary from state to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, often incorporating emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> customs, but there are still common traditions that originate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> heritage that are shared from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to community. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word for a wedding is boda, meaning ‚Äúnuptials,‚Äù and often <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> will call a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">wedding celebration La Boda</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southwestern region</ENAMEX> with the most researched and documented wedding customs is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, because the descendents of the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanos</ENAMEX> have been conscious of describing and writing down their traditions. For instance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabiola Cabeza de Baca, Cleofas Jaramillo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Otero</ENAMEX> all wrote about the weddings of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. In her book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Good Life, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca</ENAMEX> has a brief chapter on wedding traditions, including recipes and a detailed description of the preparation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
When a couple married, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main ceremonies took place. These were initiated after the groom and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> had asked the girl‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for her hand in marriage. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> refused the offer, she would send a letter to her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suitor</ENAMEX> with her negative response. This was termed as giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cala-bazas</ENAMEX> (squash or pumpkin) and was a great insult to the wooer. Of the ceremonies, first there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el d√≠a del</ENAMEX> prendorio (day of the engagement), when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> and groom came together publicly for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time. A <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">great</ENAMEX> celebration would take place, usually in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>, and music. This festivity would be equivalent to an engagement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day of the wedding</TIMEX> was called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">el d√≠a del casorio</ENAMEX> and could last from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three days</TIMEX>. The upper classes held lavish wedding ceremonies that would last for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> with lots of music and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for their many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>; the poorer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> also followed many of the same traditions, although in a more modest fashion. It was the tradition that the bridegroom‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> hosted the celebration after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church service</ENAMEX>. There was always an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> that played while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> ate, and a big dance on the eve of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wedding day</TIMEX>. After the dance, or at the conclusion of the feast, there was the entrega de novios (delivery of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wedding couple</TIMEX>), when the wedding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> was formally returned to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and placed under their guidance. Songs from this ritual were collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Rael</ENAMEX> and reveal the solemnity of the ceremony.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispano</ENAMEX> folklore does not specify the actual religious sacramental rituals, but more recent publications do describe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> ceremonies that are still observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. In very traditional weddings, the arras, thirteen coins or pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, are given by the groom to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> as a symbol of security. After the wedding vows are stated during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX>, a lazo, a cord with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> connected loops, is draped over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>, to symbolize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> and groom. Just before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>, or sometimes a designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, will pay tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> by placing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> at the foot of her statue or picture. There are always lots of padrinos (godfathers) and madrinas (godmothers), bridegrooms and bridesmaids, and of course <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> music.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frances Toor‚</ENAMEX>Äôs classic book on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> folklore, A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> Folkways, relates wedding customs of the various regions and indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. A not-so-typical Chicano wedding from southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> is depicted in the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Wedding by Mary Helen Ponce</ENAMEX>.

With <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">His Pistol in His Hand</ENAMEX>
The title of a book by the eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am√©rico Paredes</ENAMEX> that has become a classic in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> folklore and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> studies. With <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">His Pistol in His Hand: A Border Ballad and Its Hero</ENAMEX>, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas Press</ENAMEX>, is not only one of the most important academic works on the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX>, but it is also respected as major scholarship in the field of folklore studies, and specifically on the genre of the ballad. It is a study of a border <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ballad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúEl Corrido de Gregorio Cortez</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which looks at the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border and the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gregorio Cortez</ENAMEX>, and presents an analysis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> as a ballad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. As stated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paredes</ENAMEX> himself in the introduction, ‚ÄúIt is an account of the life of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, of the way that songs and legends grew up about his name, and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who produced the songs, the legends, and the man‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It was in this work that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paredes</ENAMEX> proposed his theory of the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore, and especially the border <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ballad</ENAMEX>, as a result of a process of border conflict generated by the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> culture and values into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> region in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early nineteenth century</TIMEX>. The balladry of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> border was ‚Äúone of resistance against outside encroachment‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">244</NUMEX>). There was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúinner need‚Äù</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to compose ballads that sang of the deeds of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> standing up for his rights, who in the process is transformed into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. Often, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is nonviolent, but is coerced through persecution or abuse into killing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>, often a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Ranger</ENAMEX>, and must escape to the border. ‚ÄúHis defeat is assured;¬†.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> often he is killed or captured. But whatever his fate, he has stood up for his right‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">149</ENAMEX>).
When the book was published it caused quite a stir in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> because of its negative portrayal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX>. The chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas Press</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paredes</ENAMEX> to delete his critical references to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Prescott Webb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Frank Dobie</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX>. The book was eventually published in spite of his refusal to make any changes. The timing of its publication was crucial, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, for its powerful influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>, since it came out just before the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. Its intellectual and political impact on a whole generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> cannot be overstated. Almost all publications on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos and Mexicanos</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to that date</TIMEX> had been written by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sociologists</ENAMEX> or anthropologists, and the few published Hispano <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aurelio Espinosa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Campa</ENAMEX>, were only known within a narrow circle of folklore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregorio Cortez</ENAMEX>, the border <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am√©rico Paredes</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar hero</ENAMEX>, both became figures that young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> could respect and emulate.
