<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaqueros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX>)
The vaquero was the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispano</ENAMEX> cowboy and the antecedent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> cowboy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> were brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hern√°n Cort√©s</ENAMEX> landed on the eastern shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, he had with him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> breeds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>. Cattle breeding was a tradition <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cort√©s</ENAMEX> brought this tradition to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and eventually to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> introduced the system of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el rancho</ENAMEX>, with vaqueros being the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> who herded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> and conducting cattle drives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaca</ENAMEX> means ‚Äúcow‚Äù and a vaquero is ‚Äúone who works with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> mission padres recognized this labor and conscripted mestizos (mixed-race <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> to take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>. It was these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who developed the system, equipment, practices, and traditions that have lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these past few hundred years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> cowboy learned everything about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> from the vaquero.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> vaquero was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborer</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peon</ENAMEX> who was used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> to ride the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>. So it was the culture of the vaquero that became the basis for the romantic cowboy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. The ensemble, equipment, and clothing of the vaquero evolved through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> as a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> leather and regional indigenous fabrics. He always wore a sombrero with a wide brim, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather chaqueta</ENAMEX> (jacket), tight-fitting knee-length sotas (breeches), and botas (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather leggings</ENAMEX>) for protection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vaquero</ENAMEX> also wore iron spurs, like those worn by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conquistadores</ENAMEX>, which are still worn to this day. The various styles of saddles, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> war saddle, eventually changed when the vaqueros began making their own saddles, more suitable for riding hard and for quick mounting and dismounting.
The early vaqueros, those of the sixteenth and seventeenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, were mestizos, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Negroes</ENAMEX>, and mulattos. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo Americans</ENAMEX> moved into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and bought enormous tracts of land, they established huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> and hired <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> vaqueros to work them. They recruited and moved whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to work and live on their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east Texas</ENAMEX> are contemporary examples of this tradition and have many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vaqueros</ENAMEX> still living on their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX>. A social historical study of the vaquero life on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kennedy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early nineteenth century</TIMEX> to the present, has been written by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colley</ENAMEX>.
The vaquero from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> also worked on very large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tejon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> in the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Joaquin Valley</ENAMEX>. This way of life has been memorialized in the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Rojas</ENAMEX>, who was a vaquero and has written about his life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twentieth century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojas</ENAMEX> makes a distinction between the cowboy, the vaquero, and the buckaroo. The vaquero was originally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>, and herded <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far West</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX> who herded <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> in the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were usually <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negro</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>. The vaquero or buckaroo is a westerner and the cowboy is a southerner. The definition is a territorial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, with the cowboy working east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> and the vaquero west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>. It is this difference that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojas</ENAMEX> writes about in his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-volume memoir of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">California vaquero</ENAMEX>. Anglos coined the word buckaroo, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vaquero</ENAMEX>, because they disliked the word cowboy and did not want to call themselves by that name. Somehow when they pronounced vaquero, it came out of their mouths as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúbuckaroo</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> were trained by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herd cattle</ENAMEX>, and they were the primary vaqueros until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1800s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> took over as vaqueros when they started migrating into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth century</TIMEX>. The style of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> riding instituted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> was called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la jinete</ENAMEX>, a term that relates to the equipment used in riding. It not only includes the bits, spurs, and the saddles, but also the length of the stirrups, how the reins are held, and the amount of pressure of the knees on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojas</ENAMEX> was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, as was his mother, who as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> had a pleasant encounter with the bandit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiburcio V√°squez.</ENAMEX> He spent his whole life working as a vaquero and he states, ‚ÄúI speak as a vaquero‚Äîand I know whereof I speak‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojas</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119</NUMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V√°squez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiburcio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1835‚Äì1875</ENAMEX>)
A legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> folk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> who roamed through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California‚Äôs San Joaquin Valley</ENAMEX> during the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX>. He came from an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Californio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> who owned extensive property and a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX>. But he also lived during a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo Americans</ENAMEX> were becoming dominant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, when overt discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> who were considered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> was on the rise, and he fell into a life of crime. Compared heroically to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta, Tiburcio V√</ENAMEX>°squez is regarded as a proud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who resisted social domination and fought to maintain and preserve his culture. He actually lived fairly long but was eventually captured, tried, and hanged at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX>.
He was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey County</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1835 or 1837</TIMEX>, where he was raised and attended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, becoming fluent in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. His career of flight and lawlessness started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1851</TIMEX> when, with several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> at a fandango, he witnessed or was involved in the death of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">constable</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardimount</ENAMEX>. Not expecting to be treated justly, he fled to the hills, and from then on, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√°squez</ENAMEX> led a life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> stealing, robbery, and hiding out in the foothills of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. The legend states that he shared his stolen goods with the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salinas Valley</ENAMEX>. He was well liked and depended on the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to hide him from the posses that were continually after him. He was captured several times and actually spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost nine years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Quentin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different occasions, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1857</TIMEX>, then again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1867</TIMEX>. After being released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January of 1870</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√°squez</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next four years</TIMEX> in a life of banditry but also one of romance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> were attracted to him and he frequently fell in love, and he had a special weakness for married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. He claimed to have never killed a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and when he robbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and stagecoaches, he‚Äôd tie them up and lay them face up on the ground, a tactic he used often during this period. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> refers to his ‚Äúhog-tied‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captives</ENAMEX>. He was shot and survived several times but was finally caught in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May of 1874</TIMEX>. While awaiting trial in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√°squez</ENAMEX> appealed for funds for his defense. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> came to visit him in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX>, bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and other gifts. With the funds raised he was able to hire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two well</NUMEX>-qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX>. Even so, he was found guilty by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> and sentenced to death. He was publicly hanged on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 19, 1875</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.
There are many stories recounting the legendary exploits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√°squez</ENAMEX>, especially those dealing with his romantic life, as he was considered a true <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Juan</ENAMEX>. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> occasions it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> that saved him from the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> by helping to hide him. Once, at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> or fandango, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> hid him under her great hooped dress, where he crouched silently until the constable gave up his search of the premises. Another anecdote of narrow escape tells the tale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√</ENAMEX>°squez being hidden in the bed, under the covers, of a newly birthed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> offered to hide him by letting him crawl under the covers at the foot of the bed while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> showed off her newborn to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheriff</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Valdez</ENAMEX> wrote and directed a play about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√</ENAMEX>°squez titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bandido</ENAMEX>!, performed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark Taper Forum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valdez</ENAMEX> stated, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúAll I‚</ENAMEX>Äôm doing is raising <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Tiburcio V√°squez</ENAMEX> to his appropriate mythic status in the mythology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old West</ENAMEX>.‚Äù

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Vida Loca</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crazy Life</ENAMEX>)
An expression that describes the urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> in large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> vida loca alludes to a way of life of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who are submerged in a fast drug-using life, depending mostly on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX> for support and loyalty.
The dress style of the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, sometimes called batos locos, usually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pendleton</ENAMEX> shirt; perfectly pressed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">loose khaki</ENAMEX> pants; a bright white undershirt; and shiny shoes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, rucas (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> girls) or cholas (mestizo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>), may wear the same khaki pants or short tight skirts, highly teased long hair, and lots of eye makeup. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> vida loca is often romanticized, but it is the hard life of survival in an economically depressed environment and relying on a drug culture and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang members</ENAMEX> for support.
In the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maravilla</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Del Fuego</ENAMEX> shows <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la vida</ENAMEX> loca of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX> in the barrio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maravilla</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar ‚ÄúZeta‚Äù Acosta</ENAMEX>, in his Autobiography of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Buffalo</ENAMEX>, shows the life of batos locos in the barrios of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, also during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Rodriguez</ENAMEX> has written a wonderful memoir, dedicated to his son, that depicts the crazy life he led in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gus Frias</ENAMEX> presents a much more somber picture of the violent way of life led by those in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la vida loca</ENAMEX>.
A film titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mi Vida Loca</ENAMEX>, produced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, depicts the life of a group of homegirls, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">las locas</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Echo Park</ENAMEX> area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. Teenage single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are portrayed as independent and strong, struggling with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriends</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, but also the friendships and strong relations among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are presented realistically. Several of the actresses in the movie were actual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang members</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky Martin</ENAMEX> popularized the expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> popular culture by using it as the title of a song.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Vieja In√©s y Los Listones</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Old Mother Game</ENAMEX>)
A very old game played by little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> that is known by various names. It is called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Colores</ENAMEX> (the colors), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Listones</ENAMEX> (the ribbons), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan Tan</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la mam√°</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúSaint Inez</ENAMEX>,‚Äù who may also be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Vieja In√©s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Old Lady In√©s</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Virgen In√©s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Maid In√©s</ENAMEX>). All of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> are given a color by the mam√°: red, yellow, green, blue, or they may choose their own color. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Vieja In√©s</ENAMEX> comes and pretends to knock on the door, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan</ENAMEX>, tan. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> asks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúQui√©n es?‚Äù</ENAMEX> (Who is it?) and the answer is ‚ÄúLa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieja In√©s.</ENAMEX>‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> asks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúQue quieres?‚Äù</ENAMEX> (What do you want?). ‚ÄúQuiero colores‚Äù is the answer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúQue</ENAMEX> color quieres?‚Äù (What color do you want?) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúQuiero verde‚Äù</ENAMEX> (I want green), or any color is mentioned. The little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> whose color is mentioned runs away and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Vieja In√©s</ENAMEX> tries to catch her before she reaches a spot designated as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home base</ENAMEX>. The game goes on until all of the colors have been chosen and all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are caught. In some versions the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> carry ribbons, each of a different color. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholars</ENAMEX> who have analyzed the game point to the socialization of gender roles for little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, and the game serves as a lesson in the inevitable eventual separation from the safety of home. This was one of the games collected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Writers‚Äô Program</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. Although there were many games played by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, this one appears to be one with a long historical tradition.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Lim√≥n</ENAMEX> has written about a version found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. It is an ancient game that can be traced to medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, to a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Zafra</ENAMEX>. In the version from Zafra <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are involved, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> representing evil, the other goodness. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is led by the devil, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> demonio, and the other by an angel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√°ngel de la</ENAMEX> guarda (angel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> is named a color, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, the devil and the angel, try to gain the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>. In this version it is a battle between good and evil to see who can win the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX>.

She identified herself as the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother of God</ENAMEX>, and speaking in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nahuatl</ENAMEX>, she asked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Diego</ENAMEX> to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> and ask that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> be built there where she appeared, the mount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tepeyac</ENAMEX>. To <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Diego</ENAMEX> she was a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who spoke his language, so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, but his story was not heard, and he was asked to return <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</TIMEX>. The beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> appeared to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Diego</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time, and he was asked to seek the bishop‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> again. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> try <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Diego</ENAMEX> saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, his story was heard and questioned, but was not believed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> wanted a sign from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Lady</ENAMEX> so that he would know it was really she who was sending <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Diego</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX> intended to go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tepeyac</ENAMEX> and inform the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, but when he returned home he found that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Bernardino</ENAMEX> was extremely ill. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">next morning</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 12</TIMEX>, as he walked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tlatelolco</ENAMEX> to call a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> to come to his uncle‚Äôs side, the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> came to him a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time asking what was wrong. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX> told her of his sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> and of the request from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>. She told him his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> that he was to take to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> as proof of her existence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX> followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX>, still covered with dew. He cut them and The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother of God</ENAMEX>, arranged them in his tilma (cloak) and sent him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, with the proof requested. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Diego</ENAMEX> unfolded his tilma in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> fell to the floor, and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> believed, and as the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> requested, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was built right on the mount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tepeyac</ENAMEX>. The tilma with the image of the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> still hangs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>. The name that the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX> gave herself was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tlecuauhtlacupeuh</ENAMEX>, but to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> it sounded like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, which they instantly recognized as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúOur Lady of Guadalupe‚Äù</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estremadura</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> understood that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Nahuatl</ENAMEX> language the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tlecuauhtlacupeuh meant ‚Äúla</ENAMEX> que viene volando <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la luz como el √°guila de fuego‚Äù</ENAMEX> (she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fire).
Tonantzin was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX>, literally called Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Mother</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> appeared at what was once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonantzin</ENAMEX> at the mount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tepeyac</ENAMEX>. Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen Mar√</ENAMEX>≠a is often called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tonantzin</ENAMEX>. The acceptance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> by the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> was the beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> Christianity and the conversion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX>. Guadalupe became the symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Catholicism</ENAMEX>, different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Catholicism of the Spaniards</ENAMEX>. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> adapted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> religion to their indigenous beliefs, they created a religion that met their own needs and own way of life. She was declared the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúPatroness of the Mexican Nation‚</ENAMEX>Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1737</TIMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1754</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pope Benedict XIV canonized Guadalupe</ENAMEX> as an official saint. She was crowned ‚ÄúQueen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>, showing how strong a symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> nationalism she had become. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> she continues as the country‚Äôs strongest symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> identity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> built in her honor can no longer be used because of structural damage, but a new one was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1970s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Masses</ENAMEX> are held <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour of the day</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is constantly filled to capacity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faith</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> is one of the strongest convictions in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> has become a powerful cultural image. Her appearance was crucial in restoring dignity and humanity to a conquered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Wolf</ENAMEX> refers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> as a ‚Äúmaster <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚Äúa</ENAMEX> symbol which seems to enshrine the major hopes and aspirations of an entire society‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34</NUMEX>). She is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of the mestizo race, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Raza</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The People</ENAMEX>), and a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> for the oppressed and powerless. She is affectionately referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Morenita, Virgencita, Lupita, Madrecita, Madre de Dios</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuestra Se√±ora</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgil Elizondo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theologian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúGuadalupe is the key to understanding the Christianity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> consciousness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Mexican Americans of the United States‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">26</NUMEX>).
Belief in her power as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> for the oppressed has prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful followers</ENAMEX> to carry her image into battle for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 400 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hidalgo</ENAMEX>, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independence; Emiliano Zapata</ENAMEX>, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©sar Ch√°vez</ENAMEX>, during his battle for farmworkers‚Äô rights against <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">California agribusiness</ENAMEX>, all carried the emblem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>. The image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> provides support for those who believe in her divine power as the deliverer from oppression.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Teatro Campesino</ENAMEX> has created a cultural piece titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Virgen de Tepeyac</ENAMEX> (The Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tepeyac</ENAMEX>). For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> now it has been performed during the early part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> in the mission <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan Bautista</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. It has become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay Area Christmas</ENAMEX> tradition to make the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> journey to the small mission <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to experience the miracle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, although all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> organize elaborate church ceremonies for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 12, the day</TIMEX> of her appearance, so there are literally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of celebrations one can choose from to commemorate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporary Chicanas</ENAMEX> continuously look toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> and reevaluate her influence in their mothers‚Äô and grandmothers‚Äô lives and in their own lives. Although she is the preeminent representation of womanhood, she has become an icon for women‚Äôs subjugation and oppression. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yolanda Lopez</ENAMEX> created a memorable image of working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> by painting a garment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> at a sewing machine within the recognizable blue shield background that is easily acknowledged as the emblem of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicana</ENAMEX> created a dance theater piece titled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apariciones de la Madre</ENAMEX>, which incorporated modern ideas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> into the traditional images of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec Guadalupe</ENAMEX>.
Chicano muralists have painted images of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> in her traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> setting on barrio walls since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX>, and often other cultural symbols, such as a low-rider <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, are added to emphasize the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> experience. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> is revered religiously, candles are lit for her, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are left at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> for her, and yet she is very much a part of popular culture. Her image is found on T-shirts, key rings, low-rider car hoods, and tattooed across adult male chests. Her face and form are frequently deciphered on tortillas, shadows on walls, and the trunks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. When such an image is found, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, whether in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, flock to see and pray before the image. The influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> is as powerful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">450 years ago</TIMEX>.
