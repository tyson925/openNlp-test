<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ranchera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Country Song</ENAMEX>)
It is accepted that the word ranchera refers to a type of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> song, although sometimes it is an adjective that describes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> or a type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ranchera</ENAMEX> comes from the word rancho, meaning a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äúcattle ranch</ENAMEX>, farm, or rural settlement.‚Äù A poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unsophisticated person</ENAMEX> may be called a ranchero or ranchera, implying he or she is from the countryside, the sticks, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hick</ENAMEX>. In the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> folk music <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la canci√≥n ranchera</ENAMEX> is a love song, sung by the common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> of the rural countryside. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX> rancheras became more agreeable to the upper classes because of the movement toward a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> identity and nationalism and a rejection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> cultural values. The modern canci√≥n ranchera was made popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1950s</TIMEX> by the songwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√© Alfredo Jimenez</ENAMEX>. The poetic structure of the ranchera is brief and simple, yet emotionally it is very intense. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rub√©n Campos</ENAMEX> as quoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gradante, ‚Äúit</ENAMEX> is a moan and a sigh¬†.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> , the briefest form of composition and, as such, requires a greater intensity of expression than any other compositional form. It must say precisely what it means‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX>). The themes of rancheras are love and unrequited love, but from the point of view of the ordinary common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rancheras</ENAMEX> express the poetry of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX>. The famous ranchera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amalia Mendoza</ENAMEX> states, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúthe canci√≥n ranchera</ENAMEX> expresses the sensibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> and reaches them: thus, its popularity.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> One might say that the canci√≥n ranchera reflects the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> because it expresses something vital that we all have in common‚Äù (Gradante <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX>).
The ranchera originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> but is very popular in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√© Alfredo Jimenez</ENAMEX> wrote over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> songs, many becoming classics that continue to be sung <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, that have a universal sentiment that speaks to the hearts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>. Because of the style of these romantic songs, sung to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> music and sung in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, untranslatable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rancheras</ENAMEX> express the epitome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanness</ENAMEX>. The musical poetics arouse emotional sentiments about lost loves, nostalgia, and by extension about being <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>. Songs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúElla‚Äù</ENAMEX> (Her), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúCamino de Guanajuato‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Road to Guanajuato</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúLa Vida no Vale Nada‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Life Has No Value</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúLlego Borracho el Borracho‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Drunk Arrived Drunk</ENAMEX>) all elicit memories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>, grandfathers, and stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. Many are drinking songs, frequently shown in movies being sung in cantinas (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>), but they are also dancing songs, so they are played at celebrations and family gatherings. Although rancheras are intensely male centered, there are several female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX> who became famous singing rancheras, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lola Beltran, Lucha Villa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amalia Mendoza</ENAMEX>. The performance of rancheras is always dramatic and emotional, whether performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> can always empathize with the situations depicted in the verses. The life experiences portrayed in the songs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jos√</ENAMEX>© <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfredo Jimenez</ENAMEX>, who came from a poverty-stricken background himself, are about the struggles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everyman</ENAMEX>, the need for social acceptance, personal happiness, and some type of financial security. These are concerns that the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> can identify with. Although most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rancheras</ENAMEX> speak of love, other life situations found in the songs deal with fortune, destiny, and life‚Äôs choices. In ‚ÄúCamino <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Guanajuato</ENAMEX>,‚Äù these existential words open the song:
No vale <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nada la vida</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> vida no vale nada,
Comienza siempre llorando,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Y as√≠ llorando se acaba</ENAMEX>.
(Of no value is life
Life is worth nothing
It always begins with weeping
And with weeping it ends.)

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rascuache</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Downtrodden Folk</ENAMEX>)
Also spelled rascuachi, rasquache, rasquachi, and rasquachismo, this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> word characterizes a poor people‚Äôs and working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people‚</ENAMEX>Äôs worldview and defines how engaging and cultural beauty is created by them. It means that in spite of poverty, a pleasurable outlook on life inculcates a perspective that results in the creation of a pleasing cultural environment, composed of whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are available. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> may be art, home decorating, entertainment, language, the creation of religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>, altars, anything connected to the creation of a special and spiritual life. For an individual it defines an attitude, a sensibility, or a social condition. It can describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, clothes, a whole way of life. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diccionario de Mejicanismos</ENAMEX> defines rascuache as pobre, ‚Äúa miserable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>,‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>, lowly, wretched. The rascuaches are the downtrodden, the lowly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, persona que no vale nada (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that is worth nothing). In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> it could be interpreted as ‚Äúfunky,‚Äù humble, unsophisticated. What is most important about the concept of rascuache is that it captures a propensity or an aesthetic, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ybarra-Frausto</ENAMEX>, to persevere and make whatever <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possesses, or has at hand, work well together. All resources are considered riches, and an inventiveness in the use of available resources results in a rascuache lifestyle. Whether one is cooking a meal, dressing for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, assembling a garden, or decorating a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and nativity scene, a rascuache sensibility will ensure that the final outcome will be elaborate, colorful, an unrestrained aggregate of rich resources. This aesthetic can be observed in the creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard shrines</ENAMEX>, graveyard sites, and in home decorating. Ybarra-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frausto</ENAMEX> has written a wonderful essay about rasquachismo that shows how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> incorporate this spirit in the cultural life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. In his words, ‚ÄúRasquachismo is brash and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hybrid</ENAMEX>, sending shudders through the ranks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> who seek solace in less exuberant, more muted, and purer traditions.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> To be rasquache is to be down, but not out‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1991b, 156</ENAMEX>).
This underclass aesthetic was vigorously exhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Teatro Campesino</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Farmworkers‚Äô Theater</ENAMEX>) in the creation of the stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> that constituted the core of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teatro‚</ENAMEX>Äôs actos (dramas). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> created and successfully performed a play called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Carpa de los Rasquachis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Tent of the Rasquachis</ENAMEX>) about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rasquachi</ENAMEX>. The figure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">el pelado</ENAMEX> (the clown) distinctly exemplifies the rascuache outlook, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">underdog figure</ENAMEX>, who is both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> at the same time, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantinflas</ENAMEX> archetype. The prototype of the rascuache <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pito Perez</ENAMEX>, the protagonist of the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Vida In√∫til de Perez</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Futile Life of Pito Perez</ENAMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Ruben Romero</ENAMEX>, first published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX> and reprinted many times, most recently in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>; and also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Chipote</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Aventuras de Don Chipote</ENAMEX> written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Venegas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> who lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Raza</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The People</ENAMEX>)
The literal translation of this term is ‚Äúthe race,‚Äù but it has come to be used as an in<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> name for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Translated as ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,‚Äù it is recognized as meaning all mixed-race <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, known as mestizos. The term encompasses all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Latinos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin Americans</ENAMEX>) who are descendents of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> encounter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√© Vasconcelos</ENAMEX> wrote a book in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX> titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Raza C√≥smica: Misi√≥n de la Raza Iberoamericana</ENAMEX>. Publishing after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vasconcelos</ENAMEX> envisioned the successful future of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to lie in the strong bonds of its mixed-race <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> looked toward a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> identity, and most of the upper classes considered themselves white <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>. The indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> was segregated and not racially mixed, and the mestizos were more closely aligned with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> than with the upper classes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasconcelos</ENAMEX> wrote his slim volume in his search for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> identity for himself and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Raza</ENAMEX> is used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> because they identify as mestizo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and see themselves as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a special race, a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with a distinct heritage and destiny. Chicano <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> are invigorated by the proclamation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLa Raza!‚Äù</ENAMEX> and inspired to work toward a creative and political unity. In the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Angel Guti√©rrez</ENAMEX>, as quoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnoldo Vento, ‚ÄúLa Raza</ENAMEX> is the affirmation of the most basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX>, the brownhood of our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> ancestors wedded to all the other skin colors of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Raza</ENAMEX>, we are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> of a spiritual and biological miracle‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">225</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúViva la Raza!‚Äù chant</ENAMEX> is a frequent opening and closing statement at festivities, concerts, political meetings, anywhere <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX> might come together. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, the first political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> to be formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> was called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Raza Unida Party</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 12</TIMEX>, known in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Columbus Day</ENAMEX>, is celebrated throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D√≠a de la Raza</ENAMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>.

It marks the birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> heritage and the beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> culture because it is the day <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> landed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relajo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joking Behavior</ENAMEX>)
A form of joking behavior visible among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, with close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, that creates solidarity within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but that also allows humorous or satirical discussion of taboo topics that are of importance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge Portilla‚</ENAMEX>Äôs essay on relajo is often cited as the fundamental study of this comic conduct found among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working class</ENAMEX>. His analysis focuses on the dynamics of this joking behavior, relajando, and how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">working poor</ENAMEX> utilize it to disrupt values imposed on them by the social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> in power or the dominant culture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanos</ENAMEX> living in urban poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> experience <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost daily</TIMEX> a breakdown in social relations. In brief, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portilla‚</ENAMEX>Äôs definition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúIn summary, relajo can be defined as the suspension of seriousness that rejects a value maintained by a group of people‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25</NUMEX>). This suspension of seriousness in the face of officially serious issues, such as life and death, permits an individual to feel free and detached. Through verbal performances, joking, and narrating humorous anecdotes, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> can suspend elements of gravity, snobbery, or socially imposed acceptable conduct.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> social thought the role of relajo behavior is shown to be a criticism of the political corruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, but also a burlesque of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of the social classes. Cantinflas, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>, was the great relajero of all time. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comic actor</ENAMEX>, he was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier artist</ENAMEX> of the relajo, whereby in a single ludicrous, narrative monologue he could inadvertently chastise the urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX>, and champion the social needs of the upper classes, thus highlighting the obvious disparities. But his relajando behavior, the social situations and entanglements he got into, were also subversively configured to emphasize the extreme illegitimacy of the social structure. His personality not only entertained but also fulfilled a seditious function, taunting the excesses of the wealthy and the absurdities of a structured social system.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relajo</ENAMEX> can also describe a joking relationship, a bantering back and forth, which through the laughter relieves tension and disintegrates the cause of the tension of the moment. But it is the breakdown of decorum, the rejection of a social value that everyone knows is necessary, yet proscribed, that the relajo subverts. The cultural consequence is that through this type of behavior one can become temporarily free from social constraints that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life cannot be rejected. If one could find a phrase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> that encompasses the relajo concept, it would be ‚Äúto put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over on‚Äù a system or a situation. Relajando, or echando relajo (joking), can be lighthearted joking around or can be heavy in a serious way about a grave topic.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farr</ENAMEX> has studied the joking behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and found that through echando relajo, married and young single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> find relief from their gender roles and the social propriety imposed by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> culture. Laughter created by farcical comportment, or by satire, creates an opposition to the prescribed value and to the seriousness of it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portilla</ENAMEX> calls the shared laughing una burla colectiva (a collective joke), and states that collective laughter facilitates the collective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúnegaci√≥n a la conducta requerida‚Äù</ENAMEX> (negation of required conduct). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Relajo</ENAMEX> can overturn values or what is assumed to be valued. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Teatro Campesino</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Farmworkers‚Äô Theater</ENAMEX>) practiced the art of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> relajo in the execution of its actos (dramas) and in the social protest messages propagated through satire and laughter.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religious Folk Art</ENAMEX>
The creation of folk art is an unconscious aesthetic expression of community social and cultural values, and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art is the aesthetic reproduction of images and symbols for a religious or spiritual purpose. The most obvious examples of religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture are religious statues, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">santos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>), retablos (religious paintings), ex-votos, and paintings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>. But there are many other shared religious experiences among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> that result in the creation of religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk art objects</ENAMEX>. The descansos, erected alongside rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> where someone has died, become works of art that convey spiritual sentiments. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Yard shrines</ENAMEX> that gradually swell with multicolored paper or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, and rosaries are also religious art when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lovingly</ENAMEX> tended by family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The same can be said for altars, nacimientos (nativity scenes), and camposanto (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>) graves, which are assembled with artistic care, while always communicating a devout religious sentiment. Bright coronas (wreaths) for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> grave markers with built-in nichos (niches) for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> and photos result in glorious displays of decorative art. During the celebrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D√≠a de los Muertos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Day of the Dead</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> exhibit beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">altars</ENAMEX> and ofrendas (offerings) assembled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> for community viewing but also for the spiritual sharing that results. Religious icons carry great meaning in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture and always find their way into many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art displays. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> is tattooed on the backs or chests of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, and this too can be considered religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art.

In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and in small southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was often located in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and the soul and rhythm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were synchronized with the liturgical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>. Processions, fiestas, blessings, home prayers, velorios (wakes), and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> were integrated into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life. The rural nature of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> meant that often a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> was absent, so popular religiosity or folk religious practices developed among the strong spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Some neighborhoods had rezadores or rezadoras, spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who led the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in prayer for funerals, saints‚Äô day celebrations and whenever the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> was unavailable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home shrine</ENAMEX> or altarcito (little altar) in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> took the place of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of worship. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Clark‚</ENAMEX>Äôs study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 50 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> had altarcitos.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Roman Catholic Church</ENAMEX> was not always receptive to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> Catholicism. In many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> the church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> openly discriminated against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emporia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacred Heart Church</ENAMEX> was renovated and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> was said for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two Sundays</TIMEX> of each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">month‚Äù</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beeson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>, xix). The lack of hospitality and the shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> who spoke <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX> kept many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanos</ENAMEX> from participating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Catholic Church</ENAMEX>.
This situation served to reinforce religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> practices and rituals brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, many based on a syncretism of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> religious beliefs and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval Catholicism</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixteenth century</TIMEX>. The strong spiritual faith in the power of particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> was frowned upon by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and considered to be an ‚Äúexaggerated superstitious‚Äù belief (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinojosa</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>). Recent histories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> were not dependent on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>-centered religion and developed their own popular devotions performed without a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúMexican <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> spirituality developed both private and public expressions. Private spirituality, which was practiced individually or within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, stressed sacramental and personal devotions, while the public religious stressed processions, fiestas, symbols, and symbolic action that displayed the beliefs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Catholic</ENAMEX> to the rest of the community‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinojosa</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">177</NUMEX>).
Eventually every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> had its own parish, due usually to the commitment and work of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> in the diocese. There is probably a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> parish in every single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In spite of the fact that in some regions there was hostility by church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, the importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> in creating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> cannot be overemphasized. It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> that created an environment where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>; celebrate religious, social, and political ceremonies; cook the special foods of the holy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and holidays; and of course pray together. The experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>, as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beeson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>, was repeated throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> remained the most powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and cohesive force in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. It was a religious and social haven in an alien, often hostile, environment. In the church the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX> could use his <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> language, wear traditional costume, celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Independence Day</ENAMEX> with a fiesta, and eat traditional food. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> also perpetuated the separateness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Americans</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> neighbors‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beeson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX>, xx).
Religious celebrations for a saint‚Äôs day brought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> together and reinforced religious conviction and ethnic solidarity. Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, fiestas for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Isidro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, and many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite saints</ENAMEX> incorporated religious rituals and secular revelry. When paying homage to a saint, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masses</ENAMEX> and processions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the day</TIMEX>; picnics, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX>, corridas de gallos (rooster games), and dances were held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later in the day</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>. A community‚Äôs social calendar was based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic liturgical</ENAMEX> calendar, which provided frequent occasions for religious and cultural celebrations. Lent started with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ash</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, and the belief was that, if one received ashes, one would live to see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cuaresma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lent</ENAMEX>, was and still is a time of sacrifice, prayers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">V√≠a Cruces</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> of the cross) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Friday</TIMEX>, special meatless foods, and spiritual preparation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semana Santa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Week</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> with the distribution of holy palms resulted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> being made into crosses and tacked over doorways to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or harm. Good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> included processions and in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> the burning of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Judas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√°bado de Gloria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>) and the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lent</ENAMEX> was often celebrated with jubilation and a dance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Easter</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> celebrations and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> of new clothes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> egg hunts were adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> later, probably after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most important religious celebrations is the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">fiesta</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 12</TIMEX>. It often includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√±anitas</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> and serenade with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> music, a procession through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, and a dinner and dance. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</TIMEX> there are usually <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Posadas</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine nights</TIMEX> and performances of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Pastores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shepherds‚Äô Play</ENAMEX>).
Many religious practices and beliefs have survived in some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> without anyone knowing the source of the custom. For example, there is a custom of kissing a parent‚Äôs hand after receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Holy Communion</ENAMEX>. Before this act is performed the communicant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> swallows of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. There are many beliefs, creencias, connected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Week</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">observances</ENAMEX>, such as not working on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> and not taking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Friday</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">el D√≠a de San Juan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John‚Äôs Day</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 24</TIMEX>, there are also traditions about swimming and taking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>. In some regions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</TIMEX> is referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> d√≠a de ba√±ar, meaning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> to take a bath of some kind. It could be jumping in a river, lake, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX>, or just being splashed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The tradition is connected to the baptism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX>, and throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, it is common to see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> fights on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</TIMEX>, with buckets of water thrown on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The maintenance of a family altar and reciting the rosary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, lighting votive candles, blessing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and yards, and making promises, mandas, to particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> are all folk practices passed on from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>. Believing in the benevolent power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> and developing a special relationship with one particular saint is still a common habit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Helen Ponce</ENAMEX>, in her book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hoyt Street</ENAMEX>, has some wonderful descriptions about the religious practices in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">First Communion celebrations to Holy Week</ENAMEX> rituals.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remedios</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remedies</ENAMEX>)
Folk remedies often involving the use of homeopathic methods, herbs, and medicinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remedios</ENAMEX> are also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">remedios caseros</ENAMEX> (home remedies). Herbal remedies have been used for generations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, and many of these are now of interest to general health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curanderas</ENAMEX> (healers) use herbs to heal, but many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> rely on their own traditional remedios passed down from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>. Family knowledge and use of remedios may involve the preparation of teas, salves, ointments, and the use of herbs for basic health maintenance. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who specializes in the application of herbs for healing purposes is called a yerbero, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> considered to be a healer is called a curandera or curandero. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remedios</ENAMEX> are simple and basic, such as drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yerba buena</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mint</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> for an upset stomach, to very complicated ritual procedures only known to a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">curandera</ENAMEX>. Many of the herbal remedies used in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> were introduced to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>, and were ancient herbs used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egyptians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX>. They brought many herbs not native to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, such as chamomile, anise, cinnamon, coriander, mint, oregano, rosemary, garlic, and orange blossoms.
There are literally <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of medicinal</NUMEX> herbs used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. Several collections of herbs have been catalogued and are located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan‚Äôs Ethno</ENAMEX>-botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratory</ENAMEX>. These have been described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Cowlan Ford</ENAMEX> and are listed by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> name and the botanical name. In addition many Internet web sites have been established by health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folklorists</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> for the purpose of collecting and disseminating information about homeopathic and herbal healing.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retablos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religious Paintings</ENAMEX>)
A retablo is a painting of a religious scene with a saint, santo, in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>--dimensional format. Found throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">retablos date</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the eighteenth century</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. The retablo paintings were painted on either hide or wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX>, sometimes also on tin, but usually pine wood smoothed over on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side. The surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> was covered with gesso before the design was painted on it. Most were painted with tempera, using a gesso ground with bright colors, but contemporary retablos are often painted on tin. Some dyes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigments</ENAMEX> were made from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, whereas others were probably imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early twentieth century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retablos</ENAMEX> have been produced in the same form as they are to the present day.
These retablos may be painted for a specific saint in gratitude for a favor granted, or in praise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> of the saint. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Durand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massey</ENAMEX> have compiled and written about the many retablos to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgen de San Juan de los Lagos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. The paintings usually depict an event survived or celebrated, an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, an operation, imprisonment, or having received a passport to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, or they may depict a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> praying to the saint. A few sentences written on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retablo</ENAMEX> express the favor granted, starting with the words ‚ÄúDoy gracias‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúDoy infinitas gracias a la <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santisima Virgen de San Juan de los Lagos‚Äù</ENAMEX> (I give thanks, I give infinite thanks to the most holy Virgin of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Juan</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes</ENAMEX>) and the reason for the retablo is written out, with the location and date added at the end.
Another expression for this religious art is retablo ex-voto, a votive painting created in payment to a saint according to a vow. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> term ex voto means ‚Äúfrom a vow,‚Äù so the ex-voto is specifically created to complete a vow made to a particular saint. Other retablos may be painted in gratitude for something gained or accomplished but not because a vow was made. A retablo ex-voto is a work of art, a religious painting, and also a historical document. The painting depicts the favor or miracle that occurred, the holy image or saint responsible for the miracle, and a short text that describes what occurred, including the location and date of the event. The text describing the event may begin with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúDoy Gracias‚Äù</ENAMEX> (I give thanks) and express a need to state the miraculous event and tell how at the moment of crisis ‚Äúme encomend√≥ a la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgen‚Äù</ENAMEX> (I entrusted myself to the Virgin). The text usually ends <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúpor eso dedico este retablo‚Äù</ENAMEX> (this is why I dedicate this retablo). The retablo is then placed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> devoted to that particular saint. The tradition of creating votive paintings goes back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and can be found along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> immigrating from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, for instance, have painted or commissioned a retablo in gratitude for surviving a disaster or an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Art exhibits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> have shown retablos ex-votos that depict the treacherous experience of immigrating to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Rinches</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX>, known by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tejanos</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Rinches</ENAMEX>, probably a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> pronunciation of ‚Äúranger,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> became notorious within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicano communities</ENAMEX> because of their brutality. Established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1835</TIMEX>, right before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas‚Äôs</ENAMEX> independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX> were viewed as a state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militia</ENAMEX>. They were actually organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen F.

Often portrayed as heroic figures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protectors</ENAMEX> of law and order, by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and in literature, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Rinches</ENAMEX> were greatly feared and hated by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican War</ENAMEX> they led the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Zachary Taylor‚</ENAMEX>Äôs march to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterrey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> have evolved over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> and have had periods of low activity and other periods of important law enforcement work. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> they are under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Department of Public Safety</ENAMEX> and have become a kind of detective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>.

But there were many bloody periods when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> were extremely violent and cruel along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1914 and 1919</TIMEX> they killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>. It is believed that many of the folk narratives and superhero legends known about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX> were created at the expense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanos</ENAMEX> of the border they were known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Diablos Tejanos, ‚Äúthe Texas</ENAMEX> devils.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers‚</ENAMEX>Äô battles with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> border <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> helped create the image of the fearless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>. The word rinches as used in the border area is almost equivalent to the word pig, when used in relation to their law enforcement responsibilities. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Flores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe</ENAMEX> term ‚Äòrinche‚Äô not only signifies mistrust or deceit, but also the violence and exploitation inflicted upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1992,171</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corridos</ENAMEX> (ballads) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border originating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1800s until the turn of the century</TIMEX> narrate episodes of border conflict in which the antagonist is often a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the dreaded rinches. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tejano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk heroes</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregorio Cortez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Cortina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catarino Garza</ENAMEX> became memorialized because of their confrontations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Rangers</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande Blankets</ENAMEX>
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> blanket was a blanket woven in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth century</TIMEX> that was meant to be worn during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and used as bedding at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. Blankets were woven before this period, actually since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventeenth century</TIMEX>, but not many survived from the period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600 to 1800</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> blanket has particular characteristics, with designs that include wide bands and various zones of narrow stripes. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1800s</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> was not dyed and was left in colors of brown and white. It was called churro (a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>, because it came from the common sheep introduced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX>. Later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> was combined with natural dyed yarns of indigo. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> was woven on a narrow treadle loom. The designs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> blankets are very distinct, with indigo-dyed stripes, and later were influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saltillo</ENAMEX> sarape motifs that were introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1800s</TIMEX>. There was much borrowing and exchange of materials, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, and dyes between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pueblo Indians</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> in the textile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">weaves</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saltillo</ENAMEX> sarape motif has a large complex diamond in the central layout of the blanket, and sometimes is surrounded by a scalloped border. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> blankets from the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX> incorporated many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saltillo</ENAMEX> sarape motifs. Today, reproductions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> blankets can be found on stationery, cards, and other types of artwork.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romance</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sixteenth-Century Spanish Ballad</ENAMEX>)
The romance is a very old ballad form introduced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. It was the main ballad tradition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX> until the corrido evolved from it, around the period of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico‚Äôs</ENAMEX> independence. Research into the literary folklore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> reveals a great love of traditional poetry, and the romance is a form that flourished for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 300 years</TIMEX>. Written in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX>-syllable verse, it is usually printed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-syllable lines. Lea classifies the romance into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types: those of a religious nature, those that were sung to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or are of a nursery rhyme nature, and those about universal and emotional adult topics. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of the romance were not the doings of the common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX>, but rather of those in the higher classes or in military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> very old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">romances</ENAMEX> still sung in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> are ‚ÄúLa <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delgadina</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which deals with incest, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLa Aparici√≥n</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifteenth century</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. D. Robb</ENAMEX> lists <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLa Delgadina‚</ENAMEX>Äù in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> collection. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Espinosa</ENAMEX> collected many romances from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californios</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. The romance is actually an old form of lyrical poetry that dates from medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
