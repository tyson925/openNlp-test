A popularly narrated legend found throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, and even parts of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> that tells of the appearance of the devil at community dances, dance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, and discotheques. Called the ‚Äúdevil at the dance‚Äù legend or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúdevil haunts the dance hall‚Äù in folklore literature, it is considered to be an urban belief tale that has been adapted to contemporary situations. The devil makes his appearance elegantly dressed, usually in a suit; he is strikingly handsome, muy suave (smooth and poised), tall, and refined. Consequently, he stands out from among the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. Besides his stunning appearance, he is always an amazing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX>, knows the latest dance steps, and selects the prettiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> to dance.
As the tale is often narrated, a disobedient young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> goes to the dance without her parents‚Äô permission, or she goes against her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother‚Äôs</ENAMEX> express wishes. While at the dance a handsome beautifully dressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> asks her to dance. They dance <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</TIMEX>, until she suddenly notices with a shock that he isn‚Äôt wearing shoes, and in fact he doesn‚Äôt even have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX>; instead he has chicken feet, goat‚Äôs hooves, or a pig‚Äôs foot and a chicken foot. It is usually at this point, after he‚Äôs discovered, that he disappears into thin air, leaving the odor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> in the air, or, in some versions of the legend, just runs out the door. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> he was dancing with either faints or burns to death as she goes up in smoke. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> doesn‚Äôt die, as in some stories, she might suffer a burn on the shoulder or a man‚Äôs handprint might be found on her back. A small circle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are present at the dance observe this encounter, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> of the story usually says that she or he heard it from someone who was there.
The lesson learned is that one must not disobey one‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, for the handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is known to be the devil and the personification of evil. It is noted that mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> narrate these legends, among themselves or from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a didactic</TIMEX> fashion, to instill fear in young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> so that they will not disregard parental authority. In some variants a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> specifically transgresses religious beliefs by insisting on going to a dance on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Friday</ENAMEX>, a religious holy day, and a revered day of prayer in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">households</ENAMEX>. The appearance of the devil on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</TIMEX> is an especially ominous sign.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robe‚Äôs</ENAMEX> collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> legends contains thirty-four variants of the devil-at-the-dance tale. Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, collected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s and 1960s</TIMEX>, we find contemporary versions of the devil-at-the-dance tales in south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baja</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lim√≥n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herrera-Sobek</ENAMEX> discuss versions of the tale circulating in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX> and discotheques among urbanized young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
Of course, not everyone believes such stories. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin‚Äôs</ENAMEX> book contains a story by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904</TIMEX>, who says his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> played a trick on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> by coming to a dance dressed in black, with a fake rooster foot. Eventually someone noticed his foot and yelled, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúThe Devil</ENAMEX>! The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devil</ENAMEX>!‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">narrator</ENAMEX> says he was there when his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> played the trick, so he doesn‚Äôt believe in the legend (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</NUMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baile</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dance</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El</ENAMEX> baile is an individual dance step, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, or a ball. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El</ENAMEX> baile is historically one of the most important social traditions among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> conquered the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bailes</ENAMEX> have been important community social and cultural events. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, because of the isolation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, dancing became the principal source of entertainment. The social status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial society was limited and cloistered, with their primary social venues consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and home. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baile</ENAMEX> provided entertainment and physical activity. As an early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> put it, ‚ÄúI was astonished at the endurance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in holding out, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, in dancing, of which they never seemed to weary, but kept on with an appearance of freshness and elasticity that was as charming as surprising‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Shay 100</NUMEX>). It was at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">el</ENAMEX> baile that courtship occurred (since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, although they may have gone to the dance chaperoned, were allowed to dance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>); it was at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">el</ENAMEX> baile that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> interacted, that the week‚Äôs work was forgotten, and that life‚Äôs mysteries were discussed. The local dance brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> together and allowed interaction between the sexes. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> was never able to reject a request to dance from a boy, because to turn down an invitation exposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> to embarrassment and ridicule for his failure in competition, and could be cause for revenge. Countless corridos (ballads), leyendas (legends), and chistes (jokes) narrate events that are supposed to have occurred at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">el</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baile</ENAMEX>, from fights to courtships to elopements. Encounters with the legendary weeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Llorona</ENAMEX>, often occur after a dance when a solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is finding his way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. From the devil-at-the-dance narratives to the tragic death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosita Alvarez</ENAMEX>, recounted in the corrido of the same name, we learn of the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> baile in both rural and urban <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horace Bell</ENAMEX> describes the difference between a baile and a fandango in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> history and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnoldo De Leon</ENAMEX> describes the baile in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteenth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> national holiday celebrations such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinco de Mayo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Diez y Seis de Septiembre</ENAMEX> will end with a community dance. Even in modern times, professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Latino</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> often close their national conferences with a baile, bringing in popular Chicano bands. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Lim√≥n</ENAMEX> discusses the narratives of bailando <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">con el diablo</ENAMEX> (dancing with the devil), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Pe√±a</ENAMEX> shows us the ritualized structure of a Chicano dance.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballet Folkl√≥rico</ENAMEX>
The term refers to folk dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, grupos folkl√≥ricos, that perform traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> regional dances. The dances are carefully choreographed and well rehearsed; they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the dances from the different regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. An important characteristic of the dance performances is the elaborate beautiful costumes, very full and colorful dresses, that are the traditional dress from the various states of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalisco, Veracruz, Chihuahua</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Durango</ENAMEX>. The dances, many of which have been danced for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Jarabe Tapatio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Negra</ENAMEX>, are danced to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> music, and performed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> national holidays, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Fiestas Patrias</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinco de Mayo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Diez y Seis de Septiembre</ENAMEX>.
These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> became popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> right after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX>, but did not become prevalent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. It was the influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> civil rights movement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el movimiento Chicano</ENAMEX>, that launched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of ballets folkl√≥ricos as symbolic of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> cultural identity. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Ballet Folkl√≥rico de Mexico</ENAMEX>, founded and directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amalia Hernandez</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1950s</TIMEX>, became the official cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and has often toured the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amalia Hernandez</ENAMEX> based her folklore costumes and folk dances on the authentic folklore traditions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. This folkl√≥rico <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> on which most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folkl√≥rico <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are based.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> folklore traditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> songs, and folk dances had been taught within <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonias</ENAMEX> (neighborhoods), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> known as barrios, since before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, usually through the efforts of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, in church <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and mutual aid society <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, but not in the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. There was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception: in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margarite Collier</ENAMEX> started a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folklore Club</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX> in an elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, for the specific purpose of maintaining the cultural traditions from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club</ENAMEX> existed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, and it established a long tradition of performing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Posadas</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madelyn Loes Soloman</ENAMEX> documents that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> the teaching of folk songs and dances was done by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1930s</TIMEX>. But it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX> that there was a revival in the formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of elaborate performances by large dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, many made up of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX>. Folkl√≥rico <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> perform for community events, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinco de Mayo</ENAMEX> festivals, school functions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiestas Guadalupanas</ENAMEX> (celebrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 12</TIMEX>), political events, and other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballet</ENAMEX> folkl√≥rico dances are now taught in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> entering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> often bring with them a knowledge of the dances and an interest in participating. Several university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campuses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> have dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> totally comprised by and maintained by college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúLa Bamba‚</ENAMEX>Äù
The title of a song, as well as the title of a movie directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Valdez</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>. The film is about the life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ritchie Valens</ENAMEX>, who recorded the song and made it very popular in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>. The song actually goes back to early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> colonial history; it has been traced to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1790</TIMEX> when it was performed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Coliseo Theatre</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX>. There are printed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that cite the song being sung and danced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Veracruz</ENAMEX> during the nineteenth and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early twentieth centuries</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX> it was also a popular dance in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican California</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúLa Bamba‚</ENAMEX>Äù is considered to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> jarocho (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> folks‚Äô dancing music), an example of the mestizo (mixed-race) musical tradition, with strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> influences, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veracruz</ENAMEX>. The instrumentation of the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> jarocho included a small harp, a small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-string guitar (jarana), and a small <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-string guitar (requinto). The dance that went with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> jarocho was a zapateado, a foot-stomping dance. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different accounts about how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritchie Valens</ENAMEX> learned the song, since he supposedly never learned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> states that he heard the song on a short trip across the border into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> he learned the song from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> when he was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years old</TIMEX>. His innovative style mixed jarocho music with a rock ‚Äòn roll beat. His recorded version of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLa Bamba‚</ENAMEX>Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> known <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> recording. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúLa Bamba‚Äù</ENAMEX> has now been recorded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 150</NUMEX> different times in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>; for example, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trini Lopez</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plugz</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Lobos</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice University Marching Band</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormon Tabernacle Choir</ENAMEX> have also recorded it. The movie, with the soundtrack recorded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Lobos</ENAMEX>, was very successful with mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> and launched the acting careers of several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbacoa de Cabeza</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbecued Beef Head</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Barbacoa</ENAMEX> refers to a method of cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, in a pit of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood coals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> word barbecue comes from barbacoa. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbacoa de cabeza</ENAMEX> is the cooking of a beef <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> in this manner. It is an old custom and cultural event that in parts of south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> occurs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every weekend</TIMEX>, with the barbacoa eaten on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>. In other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> this style of cooking is reserved for special events such as weddings, funerals, and large family gatherings. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diccionario de Mejicanismos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dictionary of Mexicanisms</ENAMEX>), barbacoa is ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Äúcarne asada en un hoyo</ENAMEX> que se abre en tierra, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">y se calienta como los hornos‚Äù</ENAMEX> (grilled meat cooked in a hole in the ground heated like an oven). Cooking the beef <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> with this method means all the parts can be eaten, such as the brains, eyes, tongue, lips, literally everything. Although originally a discarded part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>, now it is considered a delicacy and is prepared and sold in many neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> border <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the term barbacoa is used only to mean the cooking of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> in a pit, also called pit cooking.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neighborhood</ENAMEX>)
A barrio is a neighborhood, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city district</ENAMEX>, or a ward in an urban area where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> live. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> were called colonias, as they are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> today, but at some point after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> neighborhoods became known as barrios. In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture, barrios are identified by given names that in some way describe a characteristic of the neighborhood or reflect its history. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barrios</ENAMEX> are only a few blocks, whereas others encompass large urban areas. Some of the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barrios</ENAMEX> can be found in major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Fernando</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Fer</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very early barrios were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Bajillo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Frog; The Little Low One</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoyo Marvilla</ENAMEX>, another well-known barrio in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, was famous because it was where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmworkers</ENAMEX> lived and was extremely poor. Barrios are sometimes called ghettos; even though there are very negative and sometimes few positive attributes to living in barrios, they can‚Äôt always be presumed to be ghettos in the sense of places where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is forced to live against its will. Vigil‚Äôs work on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> culture explains the allegiance felt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang members</ENAMEX> toward their barrio. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Helen Ponce</ENAMEX> writes in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hoyt Street</ENAMEX> about the barrio where she grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pacoima</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s and 1950s</TIMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novelists</ENAMEX> have set their stories in the barrios of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ra√∫l Salinas</ENAMEX>, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">poem ‚ÄúA Trip</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mind Jail</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> writes about his barrio, and all barrios, while he serves time in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>.

Barriology
The social science of barriology was conceived of as a discipline of study in the pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Con Safos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>. Con <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Safos: Reflections of Life in the Barrio</ENAMEX> was one of the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX> published by college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>; it printed humorous, political, and literary articles. It is an example of a publication where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX> could express cultural and political satire. Barriology was created as a spoof on the academic social sciences; it involved testing those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> not so fluent in the traditions and rituals of living in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> neighborhoods or barrios. Con <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safos</ENAMEX> carried <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> examinations developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio G√≥mez, ‚ÄúPhD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barriologist Emeritus</ENAMEX>.‚Äù It was also a way of gently poking fun at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture, reminding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the uniqueness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture. Some of the exam questions consisted of multiple-choice answers; others required the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to fill in the answer. Some sample questions follow:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menudo</ENAMEX> is made from tripe, which is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX> the cow‚Äôs stomach, b. the cow‚Äôs flank, c. horse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">d.</ENAMEX> mutton
Someone who is described as a lechusa is a:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peddler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b. leach</ENAMEX>, c. milkman, d. night person
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capirotada</ENAMEX> is the traditional food during what time of year? 

Complete the following children‚Äôs chant:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pelon Pelonete, Cabeza de quete</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vendiendo Tamales</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De</ENAMEX> cinco y de siete.)
Everyone knows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Charrasquiado‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death was caused by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî</ENAMEX>. (title and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corrido</ENAMEX> who was killed in a -cantina).
Each exam included a rating scale so that those who took the exam could determine their level of knowledge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture. For example a score of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 to 28</TIMEX> indicated a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano Barriologist</ENAMEX> was ‚Äúmuy de aquellas‚Äù (very Chicano); <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 to 22</TIMEX> indicated High Potential, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúo ya casi‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX>); <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 to 17</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúkeep trying, you‚Äù; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 to 12</TIMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúvendido‚Äù</ENAMEX> (sellout or culturally deprived); and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 7</TIMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpendejo‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dummy</ENAMEX>, jerk).

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bato</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dude</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bato</ENAMEX> is a word <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries old</TIMEX> that can be translated as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúguy‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúdude.‚Äù Most recently it has been spelled vato, transposing the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">v for the b. In Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, in-group chatter, and published literature one frequently comes across the expression bato loco, meaning a ‚Äúcrazy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù a ‚Äúcool dude,‚Äù or a ‚Äúwise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Bato</ENAMEX> was a word incorporated into the pachuco jargon of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>, and it is still very much a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> vocabulary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bato loco</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vato loco</ENAMEX>, is the descendent of the pachuco and a close relation of today‚Äôs cholo (urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>). The bato is often mentioned in connection with his barrio, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> vato <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loco del Hoyo Mara</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bato loco</ENAMEX> is tantamount to an archetype in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture; he is that crazy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who isn‚Äôt afraid of life. He may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang member</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>, or just an entertaining street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. He could also be fully immersed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la vida</ENAMEX> loca as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Rodriguez</ENAMEX> in his book, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Always Running</ENAMEX>, and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscar Zeta Acosta</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo</ENAMEX>. In the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Road to Tamazunchale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Arias</ENAMEX> creates a streetwise character, a bato named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario</ENAMEX>, who acts as a sidekick to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fausto</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> wander through a mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in search of ‚Äúthe song of life.‚Äù For the contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">el bato loco</ENAMEX> is not only a symbol of ethnic identity but also an icon of the urban coming-of-age experience itself.
In standard <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, bato means ‚Äúsimpleton‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfoolish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and it has been in use in rural areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventeenth century</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Pastores</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Shepherds‚Äô Play</ENAMEX>, a mystery play performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixteenth century</TIMEX>, the shepherd who plays the role of a buffoon, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jester</ENAMEX>, is named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bato</ENAMEX>.
Another good example of the life of a bato loco is ‚ÄúLa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vida de un Bato Loco</ENAMEX>,‚Äù a short memoir written by an informant of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Katz</ENAMEX>, reproduced in her thesis on the pachuco language and culture written for a master‚Äôs degree at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolillos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bread Rolls</ENAMEX>)
A bolillo is a small loaf of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> or a large dinner roll, which in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is sometimes called <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>. Bolillos, also known as birotes, can be found in most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bakeries</ENAMEX> and are often served in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The folkloric use of bolillo occurs when it is derogatorily applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo Americans</ENAMEX>, supposedly because they are as white as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, and because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> invaded and annexed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> territory, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. Although not as popularly known, it carries the same meaning as gringo or gavacho. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> also often use the term, as they do agringado, to describe an overly acculturated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicano</ENAMEX>, one who is trying to be ‚Äúwhite.‚Äù
It is believed the word was originally used to describe <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> when they occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1860s</TIMEX>. Although written references to its use in this way have not been found, there are references to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> eating small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">loaves</ENAMEX> of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> in corridos. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Am√©rico Paredes</ENAMEX> cites a stanza from a corrido (ballad) the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> sang after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Puebla</ENAMEX> (celebrated on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinco de Mayo</ENAMEX>) that taunts the vanquished <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> with the following words:

<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Qu‚Äôes de las</ENAMEX> piezas de pan?

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain John Gregory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1846‚Äì1896</ENAMEX>)
An early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> folk culture and folklore from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourke</ENAMEX> was first and foremost a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, he became interested in ethnology and anthropology and wrote extensively on these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1846</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, he enlisted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1865</TIMEX> he attended <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Point</ENAMEX>, graduating in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Cavalry</ENAMEX>. He served with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Crook</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871 to 1886</TIMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1891</TIMEX> wrote a well-received book titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">On the Border with Crook</ENAMEX>.
Through his friendship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of American Ethnology</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian Institution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourke</ENAMEX> studied anthropology and broadened his interests to include ethnology and folklore. At various times he wrote pamphlets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Indian Affairs</ENAMEX>. He gained fame as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX>, but was also known as an anthropologist and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>. Although primarily a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, he managed to conduct fieldwork among several -<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>, and was considered an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apaches</ENAMEX>. He was stationed along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>, during the era of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catarino Garza</ENAMEX> revolt, and his diaries from this period are a valuable resource on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garza</ENAMEX> movement. He learned the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> language, apparently because of his ethnological interests, and wrote on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tejano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicano</ENAMEX> culture of the border <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1890s</TIMEX> he published ethnographic articles about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of American Folklore</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Anthropologist</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourke</ENAMEX> observed, chronicled, and wrote both as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX> and anthropologist about the folk medicine practices and the folk foodways of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> region.
His approach to folklore study was that of the established tradition of the times, which examined current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, traditions, folkways, and folk narratives as survivals of an earlier civilization. Sometimes this survivalist perspective carried with it an attitude about the prior culture, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> originated, as having been a higher civilization. Accordingly, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourke</ENAMEX> became interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> customs and language, he approached them as the cultural remains of a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> civilization. In spite of the fact that his nineteenth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> biases are very apparent in his writings, the data he collected are valuable for the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border. He was elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Folklore Society</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>, and he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>. He is buried at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arlington National Cemetery</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braceros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laborers</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> recruited from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency Farm Labor Program</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bracero Program</ENAMEX>, which was in effect from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942 to 1964</TIMEX>. The word bracero comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word brazo (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>), which is used, as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> uses ‚Äúhand,‚Äù to mean ‚Äúlaborer.‚Äù In the same way bracero commonly means a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who works with his hands, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborer</ENAMEX>, and is used when speaking of all farm and agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. There was a shortage of farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and this program offered an answer to that problem, although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">braceros</ENAMEX> also worked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX>. Until only recently bracero was applied to any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> farmworker, and is often used interchangeably with words like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwetback‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúgreaser.‚Äù The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> ranged from a low of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,180</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX> to a high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62,091</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>. It is estimated that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX> nearly <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">220,000 braceros</NUMEX> had worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> under this program. It continued even after the war, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1955 and 1959</TIMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">480,000</NUMEX> braceros were still working in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Some have compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bracero Program</ENAMEX> with legalized slavery, and the impact on the perception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> farmworker by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agribusiness</ENAMEX> has been to foster contempt and disdain. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">braceros</ENAMEX> chose not to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> when their contracts ended and -instead stayed and hid from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la migra</ENAMEX>, the feared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>).
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chicanos</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">braceros</ENAMEX> who came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and stayed, never returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies, and although the image presented is often a negative one, like other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk heroes</ENAMEX> the bracero has become an archetype of the culture. He is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of the historical mestizo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yo</ENAMEX> soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Joaqu√≠n</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary figure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX>, the mythical pachuco, the stately learned persona of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paredes</ENAMEX>, the gentle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©sar Ch√°vez</ENAMEX>; the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker, the campesino of the world. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corridos</ENAMEX> (ballads) describe the experience of coming to work in the agricultural fields of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Herrera-Sobek -</ENAMEX>describes the prototype of the bracero, as represented in countless corridos, in her book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bracero Experience</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> the experience was written about from the perspective of those who returned, as in such books as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aventuras de un Bracero</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Amaya Topete</ENAMEX>, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> and reprinted several times, and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Macho</ENAMEX>! by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Villase√±or</ENAMEX>, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brujer√≠a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witchcraft</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witches and brujer√≠a</ENAMEX> (witchcraft) are accepted facts of life in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture. Belief in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> and witchcraft is common in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, as can be seen by the large number of folk narratives and legends about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last century</TIMEX>. This form of occultism <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">is an integral part</ENAMEX> of the culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conquerors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> who settled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixteenth century</TIMEX> communicated to the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> a belief in witchcraft. Beliefs in witchcraft were prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">fourteenth, fifteenth</ENAMEX>, and sixteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, and the missionary friars brought these beliefs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> worked hard to convert the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX>, and any non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> belief that was not acceptable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friars</ENAMEX> was often attributed to sin, evil, the devil, or witchcraft. Consequently it was easy to assign unexplainable natural phenomena to the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX>, and these beliefs have persisted over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. Contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> can prepare love potions, lift spells, cure and cause illnesses, and in general cause great harm. They can also take on any form they desire, such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX>, and so can make themselves difficult to identify. In folktales from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, they often appear as balls of fire flying across the sky. Curanderas are sometimes mistaken for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> because of their healing power, but they are also often called upon to undo the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX>.
Many of the folktales, legends, and cuentos (stories) collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aurelio Espinosa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Bautista Rael</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. D. Jameson</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Robe 1980</ENAMEX>) are about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> and witchcraft. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> employed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Works Progress Administration</ENAMEX> (WPA) as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roosevelt‚</ENAMEX>Äôs New Deal collected many cuentos and legends about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and many beliefs expressed then are still held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. For instance, the way to tell if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is a witch is to stick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> needles in the form of a cross into the sill above a door; if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is a witch, she won‚Äôt be able to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Another belief is that only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan or Juan Bautista</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juana</ENAMEX> have the ability to catch or overpower a witch. Conversely the power of a witch cannot be exerted over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan or Juana</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witch</ENAMEX> cannot sense the presence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan</ENAMEX>, so he may be able to trap her by drawing a circle on the ground and throwing his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX>, turned inside out, into the circle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witches</ENAMEX> often take the form of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Mexican Spanish</ENAMEX> called a tecolote, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Nahuatl</ENAMEX> word teolotl. The hoot of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX> is an evil omen, so one must be careful to stay away from owls. In other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> owls are sometimes known as lechuzas. A lechuza is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who has sold her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> to the devil and becomes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. Only a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> can become a lechuza.
A prayer meant to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> away was recited at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> in a low voice:

Besides being present in folktales and legends, the world of brujas seeps into discussions of love and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, literature, and other forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore and culture.

Burritos
Literally a little burro or little donkey, a burrito has come to mean a taco made of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat flour tortilla</ENAMEX> instead of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> tortilla, filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, frijoles (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>), and chile, then folded and rolled up. There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito, and there may be some truth to all of them. One theory is that when flour tortillas became available in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tacos</ENAMEX> de frijoles, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean burritos</ENAMEX>, were easy to carry in the saddle-bags of the vaqueros (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cowboys</ENAMEX>), so for this reason they came to be called burritos as though they were the sidekicks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vaquero‚Äôs horse</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tacos</ENAMEX> made from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> tortillas are much older; they have been around since the epoch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX>. Wheat and flour were introduced into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX>, and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> found in many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. Once flour tortillas were discovered, the move to making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tacos</ENAMEX> from flour tortillas was logical. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> tortillas are small, and can only bend or fold over once, and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times, the flour taco was a natural outcome. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">burrito</ENAMEX> can be made with any type of filling, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>, chile con <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">chile colorado</ENAMEX>, carnitas (chile with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, red chile, roasted pork <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>), or even <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut butter</ENAMEX>.
Flour tortillas and burritos are found in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, but are not known in other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the 1920s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> have been making what came to be called burritos. Originally they were called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tacos</ENAMEX>; another story about the origin of the name is that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX> there was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ju√°rez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chihuahua</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Burritos</ENAMEX> that sold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tacos</ENAMEX> made of tortillas de harina (flour tortillas). It became a well-known place to go, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> spoke of going a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">los burritos</ENAMEX> (to the burritos) when they wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tacos</ENAMEX> of that kind. Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">burritos</ENAMEX> became available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>, according to an article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Chronicle</ENAMEX>, and now there are supposedly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 150 burrito taquer√≠as</NUMEX> (taco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mission District of</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burros</ENAMEX> is the name reserved for the very large tortilla burritos, in which the tortilla may be a foot and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two feet</NUMEX> in diameter.
