<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yard Shrines</ENAMEX>
The creation of yard displays, as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> or ofrendas (offerings), or nacimientos (nativity scenes) during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, is an important way to commemorate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many holidays</TIMEX> such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Día de los Muertos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Day of the Dead</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinco de Mayo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>), and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard shrine</ENAMEX> may be a permanent display in the form of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>, a nicho (niche), or a gruta (grotto or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>), set up in the front yard of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. It may contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more holy images, of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> or the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> or potted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">garlands</ENAMEX>, and votive candles. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> are often just called nichos, and the word <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is not even mentioned. During special holidays such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> or on a saint’s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">feast day</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> may be lighted up for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to share. It is a common practice to make the sign of the cross or recite a short prayer when walking past a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard shrine</ENAMEX>.
In many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is erected as the result of a promesa or manda (promise or vow) made to a particular saint, or in memory of a family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> who has died. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard shrine</ENAMEX>, whether called a nicho or a gruta, can be decorated in various ways. There are always <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, sometimes seashells decorate the outside if it is constructed of cement, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">decorations</ENAMEX> will reflect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday season</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, there may be lights, tinsel, and poinsettias. During Lent there may be lilies and pastel paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. Yard shrines demonstrate that religion is integrated into the life of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and they are considered to be sacred sites for prayer and devotion. There is no division between the public life and the religious and devotional life of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard shrine</ENAMEX> is a public exhibition of a family’s religion and their devotion to a particular saint, as well as a display of an artistic sensibility, that emerges unconsciously from the family’s beliefs.
A related form of yard folk art, not necessarily religious, is the yard asamblea (assemblage). A well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, referred to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as “El</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hombre de las Banderas”</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Man of the Flags</ENAMEX>), created spectacular scenes up until his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. Art created in the yard of one’s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> serves to draw in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and make it a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> sculptures are created from bits and pieces of contemporary life and popular culture, drawn from many different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yardas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gardens</ENAMEX>)
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word for garden is jardín, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> favor the term “yard” while referring to their gardens, pronouncing it in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> as yarda. Although yarda appears to be a pochismo (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Chicano slang</NUMEX>), it can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Cassell’s Spanish Dictionary</ENAMEX>. The layout and organizational aesthetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers have written about them. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yardas</ENAMEX> can aesthetically constitute yard art, even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX>. Besides planting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and sometimes grass, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> will bring into play the creativity that goes into decorating a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard unconsciously</ENAMEX>, with the result being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk art</ENAMEX> display. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Invariably</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> will contain many potted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> arranged in a patterned manner. The central focus of many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> is often a devotional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> set up in memory of a family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, with a nicho housing a saint or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>, and the design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard’s plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> is laid out in reference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yardas</ENAMEX> may not have planted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>, but instead hard-packed dirt that is kept free of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>, swept frequently, and kept prepared for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> gatherings. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, preferably fruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, abound to make shade for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> gatherings and outdoor cooking.
A common practice among many working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Americans</ENAMEX> is to recycle as much as possible, although the concept that recycling is an environmentally correct thing to do is not always known. Common recycled objects that can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> are tables, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen pots</ENAMEX>, painted tin cans, and car tires used as planters. Tires are cut across the width, making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> containers, opened up and cut with a scalloped design around the edges. After being painted and filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, these plant containers do not even resemble their original form. Recycled tire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planters</ENAMEX> can line a driveway or establish the boundaries of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX>. The practice of reusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> that have lost their original purpose, such as kitchen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitchers</ENAMEX> and pots, is a means of keeping something familiar, something associated with a memory, alive and finding a new use for it. This practice probably originates from poverty, but the historical result has been that it creates its own aesthetic in adding adornment to one’s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and life. These “yardscapes,” as they’ve come to be called, are composed of bits and pieces of one’s personal life and as such can add visual charm and historical value to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. A family’s religious and cultural values, as well as the special identity of being <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX>, can be found in yardas.
