Machismo
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machismo</ENAMEX> describes a stereotypic image of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano/Latino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who is extraordinarily aggressive, stresses dominance over his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, exhibits physical and sexual prowess, and places strong emphasis on masculine rigidity. Chicano social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> have authored studies about machismo, noting that it is a stereotype often used against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> to blame them for their underclass social position in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society. Macho literally means ‚Äúmale,‚Äù and machismo is the concept of ‚Äúmaleness,‚Äù but in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture it has come to mean an exaggerated masculinity. A masculinity associated with violence, self-centeredness, chauvinism, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> is not a macho concept recognized by most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicanos</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, un hombre macho is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who symbolizes dignity, takes care of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, has respect for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, especially his mother, and possesses a strong sense of self-identity and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicanos</ENAMEX> grew up influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> movies, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Infante</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cantinflas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Aguilar</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge Negrete</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who sang to the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and defended the poor by fighting for justice and social equality. These were positive images of machos.
The famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folklorist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vicente Mendoza</ENAMEX> has stated that the concept of machismo, and the word macho, were not prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corridos</ENAMEX> (ballads) and popular culture until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>. Supposedly the word gained popularity after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avila Camacho</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> because in ballads macho easily rhymed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camacho</ENAMEX>.
In an article published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√© Armas</ENAMEX> describes machismo as a mode of behavior necessary for an individual to live life with integrity, self-reliance, and dignity. He states, ‚ÄúMachismo is a personal code of honor that is self imposed in a world devoid of universal moral law or justice. It is maintained and sustained by individual pride and dignity‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">56</NUMEX>).
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latino</ENAMEX> men‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> calling themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hombres Latinos</ENAMEX> was formed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> with the purpose of redefining the image and concept of machismo. This was reported in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> article in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Heredia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is organized on the ‚Äúthe compadrazco system,‚Äù meeting regularly and holding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> retreats.
Their definition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macho</ENAMEX> is:
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†1</ENAMEX>. He who is dignified
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†2</ENAMEX>. He who is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†3</ENAMEX>. He who is responsible
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†4</ENAMEX>. He who is nurturing
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†5</ENAMEX>. He who is spiritual
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†6</ENAMEX>. He who is faithful
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†7</ENAMEX>. He who is respectful
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†8</ENAMEX>. He who is friendly
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†9</ENAMEX>. He who is caring
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>. He who is sensitive
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. He who is trustful
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. He who provides
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tello</ENAMEX>, ca. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>)

For some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX> machismo is an emblem that symbolizes resistance to social and historical control. Excessive masculinity is seen by some as adaptive behavior in situations where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> feel racial oppression and discrimination. The idea of exaggerated masculinity has crept into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> popular culture and language, so most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have an idea of the meaning of machismo and we find it regularly used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. For instance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Man</ENAMEX> is viewed as a macho <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, strong and independent as he rides his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse herding cattle</ENAMEX>. This was a model that many young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> grew up -trying to emulate, but this symbol is no longer acceptable to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mal Ojo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evil Eye</ENAMEX>)
Mal ojo, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúbad eye,‚Äù is commonly known as ‚Äúthe evil eye.‚Äù It may also be called mal de ojo, or just ojo. It is a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> illness, believed to be transmitted by certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX>, some think, who have a special power. Mal ojo may be transferred by a peculiar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who gazes at a weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, and the ill effects are felt immediately. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Socially</ENAMEX>, it can indicate that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has been more familiar with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> than social and cultural manners permit. The glance or power of a stronger person causes an adverse consequence on the weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, who is often a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. The fear of mal ojo also indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are distrusting of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who acts in a more familiar way than is culturally appropriate. It is thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúweak blood</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äù sangre liviana</ENAMEX>, are more susceptible to receiving mal ojo. The symptoms of mal ojo are vomiting, diarrhea, loss of weight, and sometimes even death. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witches</ENAMEX> can deliberately give someone the evil eye; other times it is done unintentionally by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who just happen to have a powerful gleam. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> may give another the evil eye because of a feeling of jealousy or covetousness. If a person covets or is envious of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> he or she may give that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> the evil eye. Preventive measures that may diminish the possibility of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> getting mal ojo are to touch the child‚Äôs cheek, or make the sign of the cross on the child‚Äôs forehead. Sometimes the evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> may be undone and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> avoided if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who cast the glance pats the person‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> or temples, immediately relieving him or her of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> is induced by a witch another type of remedy must be sought.
Belief in the evil eye or that someone can harm another by looking at him or her in a certain way is found all over the world. It has been documented in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Africa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and in the southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> In many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> the evil eye is associated with envy and malice.
Various cures for mal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ojo</ENAMEX> exist; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> well-documented method is to barrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">con un blanquillo</ENAMEX>, (sweep with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>) sweep the ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with an uncooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unbroken egg</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> is swept over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> without touching them, while prayers are recited, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hail Mary and the Our Father</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> serves to extract the fever from the ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, and is then broken into a bowl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and placed under the bed of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> is believed to still be extracting fever from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> is found to be cooked, it is a sign that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had mal ojo. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> is then thrown over the shoulder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, in the direction of the sun.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Malinche</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">c. 1502‚Äìc</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1528</TIMEX>)
This is the common name given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malintzin Ten√©pal</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Do√±a Marina</ENAMEX>. Although of noble birth, she was sold as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> into slavery to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, supposedly by her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</TIMEX> she was one of the women given to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hern√°n Cort√</ENAMEX>©s when he landed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. She spoke both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nahuatl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maya</ENAMEX>, among other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages, and quickly learned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, becoming <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cort√</ENAMEX>©s‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> and also his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX>. Upon learning her name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cort√©s</ENAMEX> had her christened as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Do√±a Marina</ENAMEX>, and she became known to everyone by that name, although her <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malintzin</ENAMEX>, which possibly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malinche</ENAMEX>, so she was also called by this name. She bore <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cort√©s.</ENAMEX> During the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Conquest</ENAMEX> period she spoke for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cort√©s</ENAMEX> and translated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montezuma‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dialogue to him. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> folklore she metaphorically represents the raped <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> that produced the mestizo (mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>) race, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>, but she is also considered a double-crosser. She informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cort√©s</ENAMEX> about a planned ambush at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cholula</ENAMEX>, which saved his life and caused the massacre of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>. She became known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Lengua</ENAMEX>, meaning ‚Äúthe tongue,‚Äù because of her work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cort√©s.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Del Castillo</ENAMEX> believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Do√±a Marina</ENAMEX> was following her religious faith and belief in a godly force, the prophecies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX>, and did not think she was betraying her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Cort√©s is supposed to have stated, ‚ÄúAfter God we owe this conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Do√±a Marina</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Because she gave birth to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> mestizo, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicano</ENAMEX>, she is considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la raza c√≥smica</ENAMEX> (the cosmic race).
In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who turns his back on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> is call a malinchero or, if it‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who has betrayed her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, a malinche. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporary Chicanas</ENAMEX> have taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Malinche</ENAMEX> as a positive role model to illustrate and explain the survivalist psyche of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicana</ENAMEX> in modern society. Her influence in the conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> may be debatable, but there is no doubt that she is considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX>, almost on the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Octavio Paz</ENAMEX> writes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Malinche</ENAMEX> as the ‚Äúviolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù La Chingada</ENAMEX>, and his writings have influenced several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> in seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúhijos de la</ENAMEX> chingada,‚Äù that is, ‚Äúsons of a conquest by rape.‚Äù
Cort√©s married <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Do√±a Marina</ENAMEX> off to one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Jaramillo</ENAMEX>, and they had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. She went with them to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> and there died of an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> when she was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-three years of age</TIMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> regard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Malinche</ENAMEX> as the archetype of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Llorona</ENAMEX> and others think of her as the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Llorona</ENAMEX> (weeping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>), while some consider her to be the source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Llorona</ENAMEX> legend.
To many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanas Malinche</ENAMEX> has become a symbol for the socioeconomic and educational limitations of contemporary life. They feel the defamation of her character is equal to the denigration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanas</ENAMEX>. The victimization and criminalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malinche</ENAMEX>, a double oppression, is parallel to the experiences of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malinche</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> archetypes of womanhood in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, the whore and the virgin, who symbolize the precarious dilemma of being female. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malinche</ENAMEX> has played an enormous role in the literary production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicana</ENAMEX> writing, in essays and short stories, but especially in poetry.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mandas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promises</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> dictionary definition of manda is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúproposal‚Äù</ENAMEX> or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúoffer</ENAMEX>.‚Äù It comes from the verb mandar, meaning ‚Äúto order‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and the phrase mandar hacer means ‚Äúto have made‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúto command to be made.‚Äù In folk religious practices a manda is interpreted as a promise or contract made with a saint, the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, or God. The contract is not a legal commitment nor made with the approval of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX>. It is purely a personal promise made to fulfill or complete a journey, a devotional act, or to recite a certain number of prayers. This promise is in exchange for the curing of an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or for a solution to a problem. The manda may involve the placing of a milagro (symbol of a miracle) at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> of a saint, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe cathedral</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> for example, or the lighting of candles at the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. Although the fulfillment of the manda in itself may not be difficult, its completion often involves some sacrifice, and this aspect is also considered part of the manda. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lighting</ENAMEX> daily candles could be a financial strain, and a pilgrimage may take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> to complete, yet neither is ever forgotten, and a manda is taken more seriously than a legal written contract. There may be fear of retribution from a saint if the manda is not fulfilled, and sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> actually suffer this retribution. If a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> makes a manda asking for a cure to her child‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is cured but she does not complete the manda, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> may become ill again. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> will believe the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> illness was caused because she did not complete her manda. A manda may be completed after the request is fulfilled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thanksgiving</TIMEX>, or it may be fulfilled before the petition is answered, with the assumption that it will be answered. Mandas are very private and often only very close family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are aware that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.

In parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were disciplined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who narrated scary stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Black Hand</ENAMEX>. If they didn‚Äôt behave or do as they were told, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Mano Negra</ENAMEX> would take them away. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ernest Baughman Collection</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New Mexico Library</ENAMEX>, an informant narrates being told by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tesuque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Mano Negra</ENAMEX>. A young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> remembers, ‚ÄúMy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> used to tell us when we were little, about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Mano Negra</ENAMEX>, that appeared every time little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were bad and that if we weren‚Äôt good and helped him carry in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> and water and feed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals ‚Äòla mano</ENAMEX> negra‚Äô would come for us at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Simmons</ENAMEX> writes about a legend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Mano Negra</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernalillo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. An old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> dies, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> believe he was unable to complete all his work because his spirit frequently returns. When the bell of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is heard ringing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX>, the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> come to listen, and they see the spirit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> going into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and praying. They call the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispanos</ENAMEX> to come and see, and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> is seen in the church one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> cries out. At this point the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> places his hand on the missal and vanishes. ‚ÄúBurned through several pages was the scorched imprint of the padre‚Äôs hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Mano Negro</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Simmons</ENAMEX> states that he recalls a similar legend from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariachi Music</ENAMEX>
Mariachi music is the most traditional music associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. This type of musical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has become a national symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and of most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanos</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greater Mexico</ENAMEX>. They are contracted to play at traditional ritual celebrations, such as baptisms, weddings, quincea√±eras (fifteenth birthday parties), fiestas patrias (patriotic festivals), most festivals, and sometimes funerals.
A traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> can consist of anywhere between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>. The uniqueness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is that it is composed of brass and string instruments only: trumpets, violins, and guitars. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> may also include a harp, a guitarr√≥n (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass guitar</ENAMEX>), or a string bass. Mariachis have traditionally been male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, but since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> have been accepted into many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, and there are now complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> composed of only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>.
The attire of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariachis</ENAMEX> is a charro (horseman) suit that incorporates elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards‚</ENAMEX>Äô dress of the eighteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>: boots, tight-fitting pants, short waist-length jackets, all embroidered with braid or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> ornaments. White shirts with ribbon ties made into bows, and the traditional wide-brimmed sombrero complete the ensemble. Some outfits are all white, black, dark blue, or even red, and can be very striking when twelve or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, all standing, start playing a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> song, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLa Negra‚</ENAMEX>Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúLas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√±anitas</ENAMEX>.‚Äù According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Najera-Ramirez</ENAMEX> the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> dressed like peons with white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">muslin</ENAMEX> shirt and pants. It was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901</TIMEX> that they started wearing charro costumes, following the example established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel Lerdo de Tejada</ENAMEX> and his orquesta t√≠pica, the national folkloric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX>. ‚ÄúBy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> the charro costume became an institutionalized part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> tradition when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariachis</ENAMEX> performing for official functions to wear charro outfits‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>).
Mariachi <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have been very popular in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, and currently <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> groups have been formed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> area. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at Los Angeles</ENAMEX> formed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mariachi Uclatl√°n</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Camperos de Nati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cano</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Horsemen of Nati Cano</ENAMEX>), organized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>, who perform at their restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Fonda</ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nati Cano</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Mariachi</ENAMEX> performs at many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> festivals and is also on a university -campus circuit and can often be seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nati Cano</ENAMEX> recorded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Ronstadt</ENAMEX> on her famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canciones de Mi Padre</ENAMEX> album, and received a lot of fame from this exposure. He is also an adjunct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lecturer</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
In the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> Mariachi festivals have become very popular throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. They have been held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>; and even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> originated a festival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> is home to the largest assemblage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mariachi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
Theories about the origin of the word Mariachi are interesting. There is the idea that it evolved from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mar√≠a</ENAMEX>, the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX>. Another idea is that it comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> word for marriage. But it is likely that the etymology of the word is of an indigenous nature. Mariachi <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> originated in the region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalisco</ENAMEX>, even before it was named as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, a region greatly influenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coca</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and in fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Nahuatl</ENAMEX> word for contemporary indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> is mariachitos.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Matachines</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dancers</ENAMEX>)
The name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> and the dance they perform on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</TIMEX> in many parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> the dance is performed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pueblo Indians</ENAMEX> in honor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>. The dance is also performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other holidays</TIMEX> and saints‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Controversy over the origin of this ritual dance-drama has not been resolved, and the literature and research produced keep growing. It is based on a medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> mystery play, but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> version, influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> culture and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, it portrays the betrayal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montezuma</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX>, and the acceptance of Christianity by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montezuma</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> origins lie in the conflict between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danza de los Matachines</ENAMEX> is probably the only ritual dance that is danced by both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>.
The word matachines can translate to mean ‚Äúclowning‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äútrickery,‚Äù but can also mean ‚Äúpuppet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù ‚Äújester,‚Äù and ‚Äúbuffoon</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Matachines</ENAMEX> refers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who dance as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is composed usually of twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, but can have from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sixteenth-century Europe</ENAMEX> a matachin was a masked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entertainer</ENAMEX> who danced with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX>. It is likely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> transplanted the dance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and that matachin may come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> word mutawajjihin, meaning ‚Äúto assume a mask.‚Äù There are many eighteenth- and nineteenth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> literary references to a matachine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> dance, indicating that such a dance was performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
Similar to the dance-drama of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Moros y Cristianos</ENAMEX>, the dance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Matachines</ENAMEX> was taught to the subjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> as a custom to celebrate on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> feast days but also as a means of converting them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Flavia Waters Champe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs interpretation is that the dance was brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> who came with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Vargas</ENAMEX> at the time of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> conquest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1692</TIMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> the dance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is open only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and it is considered an honor to be a part of it. The masked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, with decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headdresses</ENAMEX>, dance in two parallel rows, in bright costumes decorated with long ribbons that appear to be a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> and southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> in origin. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> in the drama are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Monarca</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King</ENAMEX>, who represents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montezuma</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitanes</ENAMEX>. The swords referred to earlier have become <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-pronged palmas (<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. In the performances of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Reina</ENAMEX>, but in others she might be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Malinche</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who became the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cort√©s</ENAMEX>, who represents innocence or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Reina</ENAMEX> is often a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> dressed in a white dress. In some locations it is believed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Twelve Apostles</ENAMEX>, but in others they are just ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. They carry an image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and move along in a candle-lit procession. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> and sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Abuelo</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Abuela</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>), who act as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and also as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clowns</ENAMEX> throughout the dance. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Abuelo</ENAMEX> wears a rubber mask, and is dressed somewhat like a white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, sometimes carrying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX>, and directing the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>. He calls out songs and dance instructions and cracks his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX> against the ground. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX>, sometimes a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>, will represent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Toro</ENAMEX> (the bull), who initiates a bullfight with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Abuelo</ENAMEX> and is slain. This side battle symbolizes the battle between good and evil. The music is usually played with nonindigenous instruments like the violin and guitar. The costumes and masks of the dance are very important and are usually made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> themselves or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
In some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Matachines</ENAMEX> perform their dance on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Year‚Äôs Day</ENAMEX>, or the town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> saint‚Äôs day. There is documentation of the Matachines dance performed during church fiestas and funerals by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarahumara Indians</ENAMEX> of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laredo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matachines</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladrillera</ENAMEX> barrio venerate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Cross</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX> as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>. In this instance the tradition here is closely related to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yaqui</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayo</ENAMEX> matachines.
Interestingly both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> are still performing a dance introduced into the New World over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years ago</TIMEX>. This tradition performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> reinforces a heritage with roots in the culture from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>, and mestizos (mixed-race <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>) perform it, the dance has evolved with different interpretations and has different meanings for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The experience of having a religion imposed on a culture is very different for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it was imposed on, than for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who imposed it.

A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> made with tripe, the stomach lining of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX>, pig‚Äôs or calf feet, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, such as posole (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>) or hominy. The tripe with onions and garlic is cooked for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX>, posole or hominy is added, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red chile</ENAMEX>. Sometimes it is made without chile and may be called menudo blanco. In parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may call it panza, which is a slang word for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústomach</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Texas</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s</TIMEX>, menudo was called caf√© de hueso by street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, literally, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúbone coffee‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúcoffee from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>.‚Äù This name may refer to its understood medicinal value, which is to cure a hangover, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la cruda</ENAMEX>. It is typically eaten <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>, anytime after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>, and on such holidays as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Year‚Äôs Day</ENAMEX>, or other big celebrations. It is served in deep bowls and topped with chopped onions, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon juice</ENAMEX>, crushed oregano, and more chile. Spicy hot, with lots of chile along with hot tortillas, it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious dish</ENAMEX> that somehow does cure many ailments. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> feels fortified and strong after such a meal.

In the novel <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fabricated Mexican</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Rivera</ENAMEX> describes how he and his stepfather cut and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook menudo</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>, since his mother refuses to let them cook it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>, because of the awful smell.

Lo Mexicano
An expression and concept that came into usage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>, but was not completely culturally defined until after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1920s</TIMEX>. The concept had to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> nationalism and a sense of self-identity with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> consciousness. The term conceptualized a new identity and an awareness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanness</ENAMEX> that was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX>, drawing on the indigenous and the mestizaje (mixed-race nature) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. It was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX> when the term lo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mexicano</ENAMEX> became more known in association with nationalism and could be seen in the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and in the art and literature produced after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>. Even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the art of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego Rivera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jos√© Clemente Orozco</ENAMEX>, was admired and well received because of its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> character. The writings and research of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Ramos</ENAMEX> brought attention to the national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicano</ENAMEX>, and to a definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> identity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lo Mexicano</ENAMEX> referred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanidad</ENAMEX>, the national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>, which was mestizo (mixed-race) and not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>.
This essence called lo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicano</ENAMEX> can be found in art, literature, music, and folklore, for it encompasses the whole experience of being culturally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>. The lore of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicanidad</ENAMEX> has migrated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> with the waves of immigration in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 100 years</TIMEX>, and lo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicano</ENAMEX> forms part of the identity of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicanos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Am√©rico Paredes‚</ENAMEX>Äôs life work was an attempt to understand lo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mexicano</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> experience through folklore, in the text of narratives and in the context of folk performances.

A nationalistic sentiment among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chicanos</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">el Mexico de afuera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> from the outside) exhibited by patriotic activities such as parades, fiestas patrias (patriotic festivals), and celebrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>. The expression was used to reflect a nationalistic ideology during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s and 1930s</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that in effect reduced regional differences among the various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico Lindo</ENAMEX> sentiment expressed a patriotism and a love of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> and anything <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>. It made difficult life experiences of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> more acceptable. The concept was popularized by a song with the same title sung to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mariachi</ENAMEX> music by the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge Negrete</ENAMEX>. The last stanza of the song states:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">M√©xico lindo y</ENAMEX> querido
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Si</ENAMEX> muero lejos de ti

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> que me traigan aqu√≠.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, beautiful and dear,
If I die far from thee
They should say that I am asleep
And bring me back here.)
These words have brought tears to the eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> born in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, including many who have never traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mica</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Card</ENAMEX>)
This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> people‚Äôs slang term for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> card issued to legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant residents</ENAMEX>, also known as the ‚Äúgreen card,‚Äù in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The legal name of the card is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alien Registration Receipt Card</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Form I-151</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-551</ENAMEX>). The card is no longer a green color, but it has continued to be called this since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the 1970s</TIMEX>. Illegal trafficking in the mica is very common, and there have always been forgeries of the green card and social security cards as well. Undocumented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> manage to learn where to purchase such forgeries. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who sells micas is referred to as a miquero. It is unknown how the word mica originated as a name for the green card. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> a mica is a female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>, but it is used for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who flirts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> or a coquette. The mica is definitely an enticement that lures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
Illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> in search of work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, and most are willing to do anything for employment. The folklore generated from this experience has been frozen into legends and family oral histories. The mica is a coveted trophy that opens doors to employment. Sometimes it can be gotten illegally by purchase or legally by marrying an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and becoming a legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX>. These experiences are dramatized in corridos (ballads). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> corrido, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúMi Micaela</ENAMEX>,‚Äù hides the word mica in a woman‚Äôs name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Micaela</ENAMEX>, but the first line gives it away: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúT√</ENAMEX>∫ eres mi <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mica, Mica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Micaela</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">T√∫ representas todo lo que mi alma anhela‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">You are my Mica, Mica, my Micaela, You</ENAMEX> represent all that my soul desires). Later in the song there is the following line: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúTienes que ser mi <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Micaela</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Verde</ENAMEX> como <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">los pastos de las praderas‚Äù</ENAMEX> (You have to be my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mica</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micaela</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> like the pastures in the fields) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herrera-Sobek</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993b</TIMEX>). The play on words, unknown to the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>, refers to the acquiring of the green card, the mica.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Migra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration Officials</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> migra is an abbreviated and slang term for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Patrol</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phrase ‚Äúhay viene la migra!‚Äù</ENAMEX> has been cried out in fear for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexicano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and in the workplaces where they are employed. Raids by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la migra</ENAMEX> are commonplace and have been depicted in films, novels, jokes, and verbal narratives for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Migra</ENAMEX> is short for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word immigraci√≥n, and has become an important and viable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in the vocabulary and culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos and Mexicanos</ENAMEX> alike. Cartoons and jokes often depict la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migra officials</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policemen</ENAMEX> who chase down innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. In the folk dramas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Teatro Campesino</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Farmworkers‚Äô Theater</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la migra</ENAMEX> was often characterized as an unscrupulous arrogant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrol officer</ENAMEX> who accepted bribes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> and ordered raids in the agricultural fields to arrest undocumented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before payday. Starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1940s</TIMEX> and into the present, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la migra</ENAMEX> made raids in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Joaquin Valley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, rounding up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">braceros</ENAMEX> who had overstayed their contract time allocation. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> la <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migra</ENAMEX> has acquired a much more sinister image as individual abuses are shown on television <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> news programs. Still, many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicanos</ENAMEX> grew up being threatened by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that if they didn‚Äôt behave, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúte vay llevar la migra</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù la migra</ENAMEX> would come and take them away, presumably to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have played a game of ‚Äúla migra chasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>,‚Äù similar to the ‚Äúcowboys and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians‚Äù</ENAMEX> games of earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milagros</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miracles</ENAMEX>)
A milagro is literally a miracle, but in folk religious practices milagros are tiny objects presented to a saint at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, as a token or offering intended to fulfill a vow made to that saint. Sometimes these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> are called ex-votos, meaning ‚Äúfrom a vow,‚Äù and are in the shape of the object that symbolizes what the vow was about. For example the milagro could be in the shape of an arm, heart, leg, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> such vows may be called promesas or mandas and can be fulfilled by prayers, pilgrimages, and promised visits to a saint‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> if the wish or favor is granted. This is an important folk religious tradition common among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> may make a promesa to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, to visit her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadalajara</ENAMEX>, if her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is cured of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. When the promesa is fulfilled this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> may leave a tiny silver breast, a milagro, to symbolize the realization of the promesa.
Milagros are made out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, wax, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>, but the most common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> is silver or a silverlike <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>, and they are usually very tiny objects, about one inch in diameter. The custom of offerings to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> goes back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and can be traced to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> among pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian Greeks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romans</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberians</ENAMEX>. The tradition as it has evolved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> is an amalgamation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> beliefs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Saints</ENAMEX> are very important among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano Catholics</ENAMEX>, influencing every aspect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life and acting as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> between man and God. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promesas</ENAMEX> made to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> and the milagros presented are a reflection of their strong predominance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, this custom has been documented since the colonial period and was undoubtedly introduced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>.
It is known that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hern√°n Cort√©s</ENAMEX>, the conqueror of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, had a milagro made in the shape of a gold scorpion, which he offered to the patroness of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. This was in thanks for surviving the bite of a scorpion that he received in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yautepec</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1528</TIMEX>. In the past most milagros were commissioned, and the local silversmith made them out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> or sometimes gold. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> they are mass-produced and can be bought at religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> may be found in various <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, cathedrals, and on saints‚Äô clothing throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> and of course in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. The milagros are pinned to the clothing of the saint and left there until collected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caretaker</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.

A translation of the word ‚Äúwetback,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù</ENAMEX> sometimes spelled moja‚Äôo, which literally simply means ‚Äúwet.‚Äù It is a pejorative expression, although it is sometimes used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> to come to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Also it is a designation used against all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, with the same prejudicial meaning as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúgreaser‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúspic.‚Äù Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX> use the term to refer to recent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>. Among teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX> the word mojado is translated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> are often just called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúwets</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos (ballads) and novels. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas, a literal translation for the word wetback. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX> a well--established <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> released a film titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Espaldas Mojadas</ENAMEX>, which intended to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> not to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> that would appear in countless other films and novels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> experience: the wetback, the pocho (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coyote</ENAMEX> (smuggler) who smuggles <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mister Sterling</ENAMEX>.

Mollera, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ca√≠da de</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fallen Fontanelle</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ca√≠da de mollera</ENAMEX> (literally, the fall of the fontanelle) is a medical condition that can occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX>, is often classified as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> illness, but has obvious medical symptoms. The fontanelle, on the top of an infant‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, is a membrane-covered opening between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two incompletely</NUMEX> grown bones, a soft spot that will disappear when the bones grow together as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> grows. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are greatly guarded so <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la mollera</ENAMEX> will not fall and cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">grave illness</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. The soft spot on the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> may fall if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> falls or is knocked around, shaken too hard, or suffers a trauma or an accident. It is believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la mollera</ENAMEX> has fallen when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> becomes ill with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ceaseless</ENAMEX> crying, fever, diarrhea, and possibly vomiting. Remedies for ca√≠da de mollera involve trying to return the fontanelle to its proper position. This can be done by sucking on the soft spot, by pushing upward on the roof of the infant‚Äôs mouth, by holding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> upside down and patting the feet, or by using a warm compress. If the mollera is not repositioned death can occur.
There is considerable evidence to support the idea that the concept of ca√≠da de mollera is of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> origin. It is not a health concept found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> or even in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> believed in an inner <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> that provided warmth, courage, vitality, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, growth. This force was known as tonalli, and was found throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, but resided primarily in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. If this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> was lost through violence or a trauma, death could occur. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> were especially at risk, because this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> could be lost through the fontanelle, which was not yet fully closed. By not cutting a child‚Äôs hair and by watching the mollera and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> took care to not lose the tonalli. Some of the remedies for ca√≠da de mollera reportedly performed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> are similar to those still used by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and curanderos. Many of a child‚Äôs symptoms, as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>, can be linked to medical conditions such as dehydration, which can occur from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diarrhea</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> mollera is also considered important as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> grows older. Before entering a pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, or getting wet at the beach, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> insist that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> first wet the top of their heads, so as not to catch a cold or another illness. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúM√≥jese la mollera</ENAMEX> antes de entrar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agua</ENAMEX>,‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are instructed. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Americans</ENAMEX> refer to this condition as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> folk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> may not recognize the medical conditions. Often the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who can cure ca√≠da de mollera is a curandera.

A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> dance and drama first performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1531</TIMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernal Diaz del Castillo</ENAMEX>. There is documentation indicating it was staged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan de O√±ate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1598</TIMEX>. The drama originates in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twelfth century</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaime</ENAMEX> I reconquered a region in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> that was controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. It used to be performed completely on horseback and seems to have traveled the world, following the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Guiana</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> it became a warlike spectacle, involving many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> riding the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and wearing extravagant clothing. Unlike the religious plays performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, this one is secular. Although it was traditionally performed on horseback, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> were not allowed to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, they performed it as a dance. The objective of the drama is to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moros</ENAMEX> steal the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Cross</ENAMEX> that sits in the center of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cristianos</ENAMEX> win it back by staging a sword battle between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> battalions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>. Once the cross is returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>) the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> (infidels) pledge obedience to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. The defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moors</ENAMEX> are forgiven and become <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> in the last scene. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> the drama was staged to show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> that their subjection was already complete, just as it happened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX>. The ideological message is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> are not annihilated but rather absorbed as fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chimayo Moros y Cristianos</ENAMEX> continue to perform this drama up to the present day. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lea‚Äôs</ENAMEX> book reproduces the dialogue of the drama, and she states that no other complete copy exists ‚Äúof this,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> play to be presented on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">continent‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">23</NUMEX>).
In contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alicante</ENAMEX> continues to have a major festival known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las Fiestas de Moros y Cristianos</ENAMEX> that is a combination of religious and secular processions, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 5,000</NUMEX> lavishly costumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">festival</ENAMEX> is celebrated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three to four days</TIMEX>, with several battles taking place to win back the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Cross</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> are in the lead, but eventually they lose to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Muerte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Death</ENAMEX>)
Death, personified as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and dressed in white clothing, is a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicano</ENAMEX> folklore. Commonly accepted as just <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Muerte</ENAMEX>, she is a frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> in legends, urban belief tales, and is integrated into many family folk belief systems. Death is sometimes feared, but it is also accepted as the transition to another stage of the life cycle. A common saying is ‚ÄúDe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la muerte y la suerte nadie se escapa‚Äù</ENAMEX> (No one escapes from death or luck) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espinosa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. M.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">404</NUMEX>). She habitually appears <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who are out alone, some intentionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> innocently on their way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from work. In tales collected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Muerte</ENAMEX> is seen standing at streetlights, or waiting by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> or the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. She appears to be a beautiful, young voluptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, wearing a long flowing white dress, with her face covered or averted. Once she is picked up and seated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, or on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, she shows her face to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX>. She has no face; what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> see is a skull. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Texas</ENAMEX> she is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Vieja Blanca</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> in white, and she acts as a siren, enticing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, but when they get a look at her face, they see her hideous white skull instead. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> faint, run away, or become deathly ill of susto (fright). In most tales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Muerte</ENAMEX> her appearances occur after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who have nonmoral or immoral schemes. The basic structure of the legend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Muerte</ENAMEX> will involve a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> alone at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, buggy, or he may be on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, and he sees a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in white, often with blond hair, standing by the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> or near a river. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> is immediately attracted and wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, but when he gets near her and sees the skull face, he faints and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours later</TIMEX> awakens in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> surrounding him. Tales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Muerte</ENAMEX> are narrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to reinforce an adherence to social cultural norms and marital fidelity. The legend of the appearance of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Llorona</ENAMEX>, is structurally similar to stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Muerte</ENAMEX>, and sometimes the same story will use both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> interchangeably.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Muerte</ENAMEX> is also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Do√±a Sebastiana</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. She is found in the death cart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penitentes</ENAMEX>, in the form of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skeleton</ENAMEX> sitting and carrying a bow and arrow. During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holy Week</ENAMEX> ceremonies <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Penitentes</ENAMEX> pull the death cart along in their processions.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muralismo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mural Art</ENAMEX>)
The artistic movement of painting murals in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> barrios. The development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicano Muralismo</ENAMEX> grew out of the political context of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> civil rights movement, a nationalistic political struggle waged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. It imitated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> mural art that was created during the postrevolutionary period of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history, and was intended to promote political action and raise consciousness. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> the mural movement started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1970</TIMEX>. It involved a variety of interested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>; as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alicia Gonzales</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúThe emergent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano Mural Movement</ENAMEX> brought together the self-taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, the sign-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, the house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, the mass-production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> from the billboard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, the college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art student</ENAMEX>, and the graffiti artist‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">155</ENAMEX>). A statewide meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> mural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> was held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September of 1974</TIMEX> as a means of developing cooperation and communication for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> working throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. The early murals were considered public folk art because of the common themes of community and civil rights and because most of the murals were located in working-class neighborhoods and urban barrios. Often, these early murals were referred to as a people‚Äôs art. This concept was well expressed by a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women artists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> who called themselves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mujeres Muralistas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> muralists). ‚ÄúOur interest as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> is to put art close to where it needs to be. Close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; close to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; close to everyone who has to walk or ride the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> to get places. We want our art either out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> or in places where a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and other public places‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockcroft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cockcroft</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107</NUMEX>).
The scenes of many early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> murals consisted of pre-Columbian indigenous themes and motifs that reflected a mestizo (mixed-race) heritage and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> cultural nationalism. Images of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√°n</ENAMEX>, a concept from the pre--<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conquest</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> symbols represented cultural pride and national loyalty. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> turned to symbols that portrayed the traditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, traditions that distinguished them from mainstream <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture. These images can still be found in murals located in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Chicano muralists followed the tradition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">muralists</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego Rivera</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Alfaro Siqueiros</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jos√© Clemente Orozco</ENAMEX>, and used murals to rewrite the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> experience. Murals were also intended to educate the community on the antiquity and ancestry of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicano</ENAMEX>. What was not provided in textbooks and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> was flashed across walls in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> neighborhoods. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> muralists sought to paint the history they knew, a history often based on ‚Äúoral traditions, legends and myths‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">136</NUMEX>).
Finally, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom√°s Ybarra-Frausto</ENAMEX> explains, Chicano/a art reflects a ‚Äúcontinual effort toward developing an enhanced art of resistance‚Äîan art which is not a resistance to the materials and forms of art, but rather a resistance to entrenched social systems of power, exclusion and negation‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX>).

Murrieta, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>?<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">?‚Äì1853</ENAMEX>)
The legend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX> is the romantic story of a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> highwayman, considered a bandit by history but a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk hero</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>. At a time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were terribly mistreated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, it is believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murrieta</ENAMEX> was falsely accused of crimes he did not commit and this prompted him to fight for his rights and those of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX>, whose name is also spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murieta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murietta</ENAMEX>, roamed the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and hills of northern and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Shasta</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> border in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1850s</TIMEX>, stealing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and robbing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> alike. There have been countless books, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, and articles written about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murrieta</ENAMEX> or about the legend of this famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> bandito. According to the legend, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX> was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and migrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> with his new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> in search of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. He became a bandit and robber after many wrongs were committed against him by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. There are several variants of his story, but all have a similar general theme as to why and how he became a bandit.
During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1850s</TIMEX> there were at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaqu√≠n</ENAMEX>, all of whom are credited with committing robberies and banditry. There was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta, Joaqu√≠n Valenzuela, Joaqu√≠n Carrillo, Joaqu√≠n Ocomorena</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Botilleras</ENAMEX>. Some say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valenzuela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocomorena</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and the same, and when he was hanged, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Joaqu√</ENAMEX>≠ns were eliminated. Although it is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murrieta</ENAMEX> used all of these names as aliases, it is likely that there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Joaqu√</ENAMEX>≠ns at the time. Murrieta started his life of banditry and crime after his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> was invaded by white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX>, who raped his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa</ENAMEX> and beat up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n.</ENAMEX> Later he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> were accused of stealing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, a crime for which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> was lynched and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√</ENAMEX>≠n flogged.
There have been over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX>-one published versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX> legend. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> the one considered most -authentic was by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rollin Ridge</ENAMEX>, serialized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Gazette</ENAMEX> and eventually published under the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Life and Adventures of Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Celebrated California Bandit</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1854</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rollin Ridge</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cherokee</ENAMEX> also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yellow Bird</ENAMEX>, wrote his story <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> after the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murrieta</ENAMEX>. This is the basic story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√</ENAMEX>≠n that all subsequent histories are based on. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Gazette</ENAMEX> printed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ridge‚Äôs</ENAMEX> story in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> installments and this publicity helped to further disseminate the story. The book was translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> it was better known abroad than in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. In doubting the details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Murrieta</ENAMEX> legend, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ridge‚Äôs</ENAMEX> version, which some say was based on newspaper stories about the various bandits named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n.</ENAMEX> It is believed by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ridge</ENAMEX> just applied the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Murrieta</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√</ENAMEX>≠n that was finally captured and decapitated. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ridge</ENAMEX> identified with the discriminatory treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>, and he stated that he wanted to do justice to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX>.

Howe</ENAMEX> wrote a play about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√</ENAMEX>≠n in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1859</TIMEX> that covers his escapades from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1851 to July 24, 1853</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> he was captured and killed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Harry Love</ENAMEX>. It is not known if the play was ever performed, but the portrayal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murrieta</ENAMEX> is moving and especially interesting because of all the negative publicity following his capture and death. Howe portrays him as an aristocratic intelligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who commits crimes to avenge the wrongs committed against himself and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Henry Jackson‚</ENAMEX>Äôs work traces the history of the legend, claiming all the information came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Rollin Ridge</ENAMEX> version and that he should be credited with starting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äúfictitious‚Äù</ENAMEX> legend. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> does quote from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Alta</ENAMEX> newspaper demonstrating that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suspected it was not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX> who was killed and decapitated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Harry Love</ENAMEX>, but quite possibly another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Joaqu√≠n</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúevery murder and robbery in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has been attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄòJoaqu√≠n</ENAMEX>.‚Äô Sometimes it is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Joaqu√≠n Carrillo</ENAMEX> that has committed all these crimes; then it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX>, then Joaqu√≠n something else, but always <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaqu√≠n!‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Stewart</ENAMEX> wrote a long epic poem in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rosita, A California Tale</ENAMEX>, in which he speculates on the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murrieta</ENAMEX>. In this poem, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaqu√≠n</ENAMEX> lives and flees in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>, and the body that is decapitated is actually that of his good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ram√≥n</ENAMEX>. Ram√≥n‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rosita</ENAMEX>, also disappears at the time of his death, and only after her death, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years later</TIMEX>, is it revealed that she had been living the life of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. This story is commingled with the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie) Parkhurst</ENAMEX> who lived as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> during the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the nineteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Murrieta</ENAMEX> legend has also been written by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latinos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pablo Neruda</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>, wrote an opera about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murrieta</ENAMEX> entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Splendor and Death of Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX>, insisting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n</ENAMEX> was actually <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chileno</ENAMEX> and not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Rojas</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Californian</ENAMEX> vaquero, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>, and memoirist, writes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX> was from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alamos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, where church records show that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosita</ENAMEX> were married. When his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> was raped and he was beaten, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murrieta</ENAMEX> saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faces</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderers</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaqu√≠n</ENAMEX> lived for revenge, and he searched every mining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> until he found all thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who committed the crime and killed them. After this he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> to live out his life. Supposedly he is buried in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cucurpe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>.

For there is little doubt in the writer‚Äôs mind that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n‚Äôs</ENAMEX> aims were higher than that of mere revenge and pillage.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†.</ENAMEX> it is easy to perceive that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√</ENAMEX>≠n felt himself to be more the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">countrymen</ENAMEX> than an outlaw and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> to the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">race‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>).
Chicanos have taken the legend of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX> seriously and identify with his heroic exploits of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. He is viewed as a social bandit and a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, and several corridos (ballads) describe his life and death. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California in Berkeley</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> cooperative student <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> first established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> is named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Joaqu√≠n Murrieta</ENAMEX> after this famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk hero</ENAMEX>.
