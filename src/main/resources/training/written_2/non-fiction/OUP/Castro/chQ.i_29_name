Quetzalcoatl
A god, one of the major deities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quetzal</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Nahuatl</ENAMEX> word referring to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>, and coatl means ‚Äúsnake,‚Äù so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX> means a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfeathered serpent</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and this god is often called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plumed Serpent</ENAMEX>. Stories about him indicate that he was an earthly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, a light-skinned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, who acted as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toltecs</ENAMEX> for some time. In one legend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX> is sent to the underground to get the bones of the ancients. After the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth Sun</ENAMEX> (an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> era), when the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have been drowned or changed into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, the spirits decide he should go seek the bones in order to start a new race. He must try <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, overcoming many obstacles, before he succeeds in bringing the bones to the sky. They are ground to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> and placed in a bowl by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cihuacoatl</ENAMEX>. The other gods shed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> into the bowl and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are born. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX> discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>, which he brought for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> to eat. He saw an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX> bringing a kernel of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> from inside a mountain, and he changed himself into an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ant</ENAMEX> and followed it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lightning</ENAMEX> was used to split open the mountain to bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. He left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toltecs</ENAMEX> to return to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. It just happened that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX> promised to return in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hern√°n Cort√©s</ENAMEX> landed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Veracruz</ENAMEX>. It was to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards‚</ENAMEX>Äô advantage to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians‚</ENAMEX>Äô belief in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quetzalcoatl‚</ENAMEX>Äôs return. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cort√©s</ENAMEX> was well received because he was thought to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX> and the conquest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztecs</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> was legitimized.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX> is one of the better-known <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aztec gods</ENAMEX> and has been greatly idealized by the moderns, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>. His image has influenced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. As the celestial dragon, he is patterned after the rattlesnake, a common mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesoamerica</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dragon</ENAMEX> has come to symbolize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos‚</ENAMEX>Äô early heritage and has been embraced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, especially those coming of age in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX> can be found in the literature, murals, and graphic art reflecting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Indian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> was started in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> with the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl College</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> was still in existence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2000</TIMEX> and has struggled to maintain a curriculum that meets the needs of both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. Deganawidah was the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iroquois Federation</ENAMEX>, and after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> was given his name, it was learned there was a common belief that the name could not be mentioned publicly. Since that time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> has become known as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-Q <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quincea√±era</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifteenth Birthday Party</ENAMEX>)
A coming-of-age celebration and ceremony for a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> on her fifteenth birthday. The word <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quincea√±era</ENAMEX> comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word quince, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúfifteen‚Äù</ENAMEX> and a√±era, which together mean ‚Äúthe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifteen-year-old</TIMEX>.‚Äù This celebration marks the beginning of adulthood for a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. It is a custom throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, and in many areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to distinguish this birthday with a special observance. It is -assumed the custom has origins in pre-Columbian cultures, as a coming-of-age ritual for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historia de Nueva Espa√±a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bernardino de Sahag√</ENAMEX>∫n narrates that it was traditional for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> maiden to formally acknowledge her passage into womanhood. ‚ÄúAdvice of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX> to Her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daughter‚</ENAMEX>Äù is reprinted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William H. Prescott‚</ENAMEX>Äôs The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conquest of Mexico</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Communities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> have formally observed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quincea√±era</ENAMEX> birthdays for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, whereas such celebrations are not as common in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. Traditionally this ceremony serves as a coming-out party to indicate that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> has reached womanhood and is ready for marriage. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> this is no longer the case, but the celebration does symbolize the transition from childhood to womanhood. In some celebrations a doll called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la mu√±eca de los recuerdos</ENAMEX> (the doll of memories) or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la √∫ltima mu√±eca</ENAMEX> (the last doll) is given to the celebrant as a symbol of the childhood she is leaving behind. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> see it as the last vestiges of childhood and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la √∫ltima mu√±eca</ENAMEX> as the last doll she will ever receive.
Although not a religious sacrament, the celebrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quincea√±eras</ENAMEX> take on a strong religious undertone. The ceremony usually includes a special <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> give thanks for having a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>, and she gives thanks for having a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> may receive a formal blessing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> is very similar to a wedding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX>, with the celebrant and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entourage</ENAMEX> slowly marching down the center aisle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. A ceremonial dinner and a dance with live band music usually follow. The celebrant wears a long white gown, similar to a wedding dress; has fifteen maids, damas, with their escorts, chambelanes; and sometimes performs a choreographed dance or waltz. Quincea√±era celebrations are held in major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> with large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> now offer many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> that cater to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> planning Quincea√±era celebrations. Although this is a family tradition and ritual, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> use the occasion to lavish on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> an extravagant day, never to be forgotten.
Besides the traditional doll, other folkloric elements continue to be incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Quincea√±era</ENAMEX> ceremonies. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eva Castellano</ENAMEX> has continued a tradition she learned from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> of making coronas (crowns) made of waxed and paper <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> to be worn by the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>. Only unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> wear the coronas, which symbolize innocence and purity. Much of the research on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quincea√±eras</ENAMEX> shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> want to maintain a cultural historical tradition, and the celebration of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">daughter‚Äôs fifteenth</ENAMEX> birthday is a means of continuing cultural ties to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latino</ENAMEX> heritage.
A booklet by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela Erevia</ENAMEX> provides an outline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> including biblical readings and a schedule of the types of classes required of a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michele Salcedo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> book is a planning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> that discusses everything from the dress to the invitations, the music, the limousine, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, including the recipes. Internet sites are now available to guide a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> in planning every aspect of this ritual.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinto Sol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifth Sun</ENAMEX>)
The narrative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifth Sun</ENAMEX> is based on an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> myth that has become an important cultural expression commonly incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> cultural events. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> of contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> literature in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinto Sol Publications</ENAMEX>. Worship of the sun was an integral part of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> culture. The sun was viewed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> with the solar rays as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">darts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> consisted of a fifty-two-year calendar that was divided into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five ages</TIMEX>, or series of ages, called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suns</ENAMEX>. The first age was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age of the Earth Sun</ENAMEX>, and the god was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tezcatlipoca</ENAMEX>, whose familiar animal was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jaguar</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> age was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Winds</ENAMEX>, the sun was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quetzalcoatl</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age</TIMEX> ended with great hurricanes. Then came the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age of Fire</ENAMEX> with the sun <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tlaloc</ENAMEX>, and it ended with volcanic eruptions. Next was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age of Floods</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chalchiuhtlicue</ENAMEX>, as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the fourth</TIMEX> sun. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This age</TIMEX> ended when the sky fell upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and the waters gushed up, turning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. The present and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Quinto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>, has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nanahuatl</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tonatiuh</ENAMEX>, as the god, and it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age of Earthquakes</ENAMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Quinto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> a full culture was created, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> grown for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, fire domesticated, and the creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toltecs</ENAMEX>. This age is supposed to end with earthquakes. Each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> came about when the god of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aeon</ENAMEX> died or sacrificed himself to be reborn as the sun of the next aeon.
