<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Abuelo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grandfather</ENAMEX>)
An old<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-man figure</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> abuelo (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>) played the role of a bogeyman in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispano</ENAMEX> folklore. In literature it is sometimes spelled aguelo, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> speculate that it may be a borrowed word from the language of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pueblo Indians</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> it means ‚Äúgrandfather,‚Äù and has become synonymous with coco, cucui, and bogeyman. This folk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is more known in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> than in other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. He appeared at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmastime</ENAMEX> to test and discipline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who did not know their catechism or prayers. He was a scary figure, dressed to terrify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with a black <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">cape</ENAMEX> and a mask with large horns, and always carrying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> were terribly frightened because of his horrid appearance. Instead of a mask he sometimes had a tortilla plastered on his face, wore buffalo horns and a horsetail, and of course carried the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few days</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, he‚Äôd knock on the door of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, give a bloodcurdling cry, crack his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX>, and yell at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúHan sido buenos muchachos estos?‚Äù</ENAMEX> (Have these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> been good?) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> would cringe and hide while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> defended them. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> abuelo would say, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúPues que rec√©n y se acuest√©n‚Äù</ENAMEX> (Well, let them pray and go to bed). Sometimes he made the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> dance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Palomitas</ENAMEX>, loosely translated as ‚Äúthe little doves.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Espinosa</ENAMEX> describes this experience. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúAfter</ENAMEX> making them pray, he makes them form a circle, and, taking each other‚Äôs hands, they dance around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with him, singing,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baila</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paloma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Juan turunt√∫n</ENAMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">durund√∫n</NUMEX>) [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sic</ENAMEX>]

A description of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> abuelo making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> ‚Äúdance the little dove‚Äù is also available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Steele‚</ENAMEX>Äôs work (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>). Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> misbehaved, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> would threaten them, ‚ÄúSi no te sosiegas, llamo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el abuelo‚Äù</ENAMEX> (If you don‚Äôt behave, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I‚</ENAMEX>Äôll call the bogeyman).
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El</ENAMEX> abuelo is also a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> in the dance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Matachines</ENAMEX>, and plays a comical role in which he makes jokes and shouts out instructions to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>. In some performances there is a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la abuela</ENAMEX>, who acts as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">el abuelo‚Äôs accomplice</ENAMEX> and plays a similar role. Although he is not heard of often in contemporary times, references to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el</ENAMEX> abuelo can be found in the folktales and literature of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Adelita</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution Woman Soldier</ENAMEX>)
A feminist symbol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Adelita</ENAMEX> was the name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman soldier</ENAMEX>, a soldadera, who followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, helped to set up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, and cooked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldaderas</ENAMEX> were employed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> and fulfil the needs of a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX>, whereas others were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>. The legend states that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adelita</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who fought in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, but it is not known if she actually existed as an individual; she came to epitomize all soldaderas and courageous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of that period. In popular culture, literature, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldaderas</ENAMEX> have been portrayed as self-sacrificing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, usually mestizas (mixed-race <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>) from the lower classes, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Adelita</ENAMEX> is often seen as a g√ºera (light-skinned), ‚Äúsweetheart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who is valiant, pretty, and a wonderful helpmate to the soldier‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Salas 121</NUMEX>). Several corridos (ballads) have been written about her, and she is a powerful symbol for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, representing bravery, self-discipline, and romantic love. In fact, it is primarily through the corridos that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adelita</ENAMEX> is known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Historically, all soldaderas became known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adelitas</ENAMEX>. In performances by ballet folkl√≥rico <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the dances and music of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> are often called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Adelitas</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Adelita</ENAMEX> is more than a romantic image to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">modern-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chicanas</ENAMEX>. She continues to symbolize feminine independence, integrity, the fight for justice, and a proud heritage. Because the major influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> immigration into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanas</ENAMEX> grew up hearing stories about soldaderas and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Adelita</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanas</ENAMEX> who joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Berets de Aztl√°n</ENAMEX>, a political pseudomilitary youth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, often dressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adelitas</ENAMEX>, wearing rebozos (shawls) and bandoliers crisscrossed over their chests.
One play about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Adelita</ENAMEX>, titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Soldadera</ENAMEX>, written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine Niggli</ENAMEX>, was produced and performed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, and is still performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Niggli was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years old</TIMEX> when the play was written. She went on to write <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX>, a novel that incorporated many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> people‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> customs and traditions. Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterrey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, she lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> and was taught at home by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>. Later she moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, where she attended high school. She went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of North Carolina</ENAMEX> for playwriting, sometimes acting in her own plays. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soldadera</ENAMEX> is a play about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúwomen who left <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to follow their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, cooking for them, tending their wounds, guarding their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammunition</ENAMEX>, fighting when necessary,‚Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niggli</ENAMEX> put it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adelita</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> dies in the play, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niggli</ENAMEX> idealizes her bravery.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adivinanzas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riddles</ENAMEX>)
Adivinanzas are riddles. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> remember being entertained with riddles narrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX>. A riddle is an intellectual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brainteaser</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> called a quebracabeza; facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer. An example in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> is, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúQu√©</ENAMEX> camina de cuatro patas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">por la ma√±ana</ENAMEX>, dos patas en el medio d√≠a, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">y tres patas en la noche?‚Äù</ENAMEX> (What walks on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> legs in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two legs in the afternoon</TIMEX>, and three legs at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>?) The answer is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, who as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmorning‚Äù</ENAMEX> of life, crawls on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> legs; as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> walks on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> legs; and as an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> uses a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX> for support, thus walking on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> legs. Another example is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútrue riddle</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer, and that something is described in the question. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúTengo ojos y</ENAMEX> no miro; boca pero no hablo; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">qu√© soy?‚Äù</ENAMEX> (I have eyes and cannot see; a mouth, but cannot speak; What am I?) The answer is a photograph. Another type of riddle is the conundrum, where the answer is contained in the riddle itself, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúAgua pasa por mi casa</ENAMEX> cate de mi corazon‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX> passes by my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> pain of my heart). The answer is ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúagua-cate‚Äù</NUMEX> (avocado). Or, ‚ÄúLana sube, lana baja‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wool</ENAMEX> goes up and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> goes down). The answer is ‚Äúla navaja,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù la-na-baja</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">knife</ENAMEX>). Conundrums contain wordplay and in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture are sometimes bilingual, playing with words in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language. Another type of riddle is the riddling question, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúQu√© le</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dijo la luna al sol?‚Äù</ENAMEX> (What did the moon say to the sun?) The answer is ‚ÄúEres <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tan grande y</ENAMEX> no te dejan salir de noche‚Äù (You are so big and yet are not allowed to go out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>).
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">riddles</ENAMEX> collected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> reflect in some way the characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, both linguistically and environmentally. Since the problem presented in a riddle is linguistically and culturally based on both the teller‚Äôs and the audience‚Äôs culture, they must all be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to comprehend the puzzle. Bilingual riddles, those narrated in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, are clearly a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> invention growing out of the bicultural experience. Riddles are fun and educational as well. It is usually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who enjoy telling and listening to riddles. Like other folklore genres, riddles serve a function, helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> learn to interpret facts and form an opinion. They use language, humor, and a verbal fun activity to challenge a child‚Äôs intellect.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>-dried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brick</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> is a word with <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> origins that means ‚Äúunburnt bricks made from earth.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Adobe</ENAMEX> bricks are made from a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> and sand, sometimes just called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud-straw</ENAMEX>, and are slowly dried by the heat of the sun. Various structures, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> are built of adobe bricks and then plastered with more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adobe mud</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Buildings</ENAMEX> made of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adobe</ENAMEX> have lasted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> when sufficient and constant care is provided to prevent erosion of the mud. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporary adobe</ENAMEX> architecture, as found in what is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southwest</ENAMEX> style, is a fusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native New Mexican Indian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> forms. The basic structure, adobe walls supporting a flat roof, is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> tradition <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> moved into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, they adopted this basic structure, but incorporated their technique of forming the mud into bricks. Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> were built out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adobe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> provide a sense of security and protection from outside noise with their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-foot</NUMEX> thick walls. Often the literature about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adobe</ENAMEX> also mentions the sense of continuity with the earth one feels when living in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adobe home</ENAMEX>.
Making adobe bricks and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adobe hornos</ENAMEX> (outdoor ovens) is still a tradition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have a long tradition in the construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adobe structures</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spaniards</ENAMEX> noted that it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pueblo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who built the adobe walls. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> community it has been the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> known as enjarradoras to plaster the walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, a task that is done with the bare hands. A saying in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> describes this as, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúEl hombre las levanta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la mujer las enjarra</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> (The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> builds the walls and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> plasters them) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larkin</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>). In contemporary times, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of International Folk Art</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> sponsors demonstrations of adobe brick making and horno construction, performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who are well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> adoberas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adobe</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> enjaradoras.
In southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, small huts called jacales were also constructed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud-straw</ENAMEX>. Even though this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> was of almost the same composition, it was not called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adobe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> was not formed into bricks, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> were considered temporary, even though many have existed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>.

She was able to speak various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages and would speak to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> in their own tongue. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fray Damian Manzanet</ENAMEX>, while visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1690</TIMEX>, reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tejas Indians</ENAMEX> spoke of being visited by a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> dressed in blue garments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> was requesting blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX> that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wanted to use in the burying of their dead. There is much written evidence of her appearances in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, where she was referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">as ‚ÄúThe Mysterious Woman in Blue</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jumano Indians</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> were reportedly visited by her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 500</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1621 and 1631</TIMEX>.
The first reference to her is in the memoirs of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fray Alonso de Benavides</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1631</TIMEX>. Every report we have of her appearances indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Lady</ENAMEX> was actually <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mar√≠a de Jesus Coronel de Agreda</ENAMEX>. She was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1602</TIMEX> and died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 24, 1665</TIMEX>. She never physically visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, but she stated that she made <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúflights‚Äù</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mar√≠a de Agredo</ENAMEX> lived in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> and wrote several books, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the title The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mystic City of God</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adina de Zavala</ENAMEX> cites a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> legend about a mystifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in blue who appears once in a generation, out of the hidden underground passages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alamo</ENAMEX>, bearing a distinctive gift that she bestows on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is always a native <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texan</ENAMEX>; she may be young, old, or middle-aged, but she is always a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúpure and good, well bred, intelligent, spiritual, and patriotic.‚Äù The gift that is bestowed on her is the ability to see ‚Äúto the heart of things,‚Äù and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> is instructed to use the gift for the good of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agringado</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglicized</ENAMEX>)
An expressive term used among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> to describe other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX> who have become very gringo-like, very anglicized (inglesado), or americanizado. Another word used interchangeably is agavachado, meaning too much like a gavacho, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>. In a bicultural environment, or even in tightly knit <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> become thoroughly acculturated to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society and values, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> may be criticized by close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, and be called an agringado. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agringado</ENAMEX> is a particularly strong term in comparison to americanizado, because the word gringo connotes a strong negative image of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX> are americanizados to a certain extent, by learning <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and attending public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. But the behavior of an agringado might involve the changing of one‚Äôs given name, so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guillermo</ENAMEX> becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consuelo</ENAMEX> becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie</ENAMEX>; or changing a surname, so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivera</ENAMEX> becomes Rivers or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puentes</ENAMEX> becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Bridges</ENAMEX>. In the verbal folklore repertoire of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, jokes abound about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> who become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglos</ENAMEX> and adopt the values, mannerisms, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, clothing styles, and verbal expressions of the dominant society. Besides becoming gringo-like, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> agringado may overtly reject <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> culture, the music, the values, and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> language, by pretending not to speak it. Such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> sees the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> way of life as inferior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>, and the agringado may marry an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> and completely turn his/her back on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture. An agringado will not self-identify because this kind of behavior is perceived as negative or disloyal to his/her cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Rather, identifying or pointing out agringado behavior tends to be done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or peer group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, who use teasing, joking, and narrating exemplary anecdotes characteristic of folkloric behavior. This type of behavior is an outcome of living in a bicultural and bilingual environment and serves to strengthen the in-group‚Äôs sense of cultural identity.
The agringado figure has become a stock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture and is frequently encountered in folklore, literature, and popular culture. The film <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mi Familia</ENAMEX>, directed and released in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Nava</ENAMEX>, includes a comical scene depicting the agringado <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, bringing his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> home to meet his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aguinaldos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmas Gifts</ENAMEX>)
The translation of this word found in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> dictionaries is a ‚Äúgift given at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>.‚Äù In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> tradition, it is a small gift given at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> party or celebration, usually in the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX>. During <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Posadas</ENAMEX>, the reenactment of the pilgrimage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joseph‚</ENAMEX>Äôs search for an inn, when celebrations are held in private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, the hostess will pass out aguinaldos to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. These can be small bags or baskets filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX>, nuts, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX>, or toys. It is a gift given as a sharing, a memento, a remembrance, rather than as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas present</TIMEX>. Mention of the custom of aguinaldos is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabeza de Baca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Good Life</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Am√©rico Paredes</ENAMEX> describes a slightly different tradition of aguinaldos that he learned in song form from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Texas</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D√≠a de los Reyes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Day of the Kings, or Epiphany</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 6</TIMEX>, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> went from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to house singing carols called aguinaldos, and asking for food and gifts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homes</ENAMEX> were opened to them and they were offered good things to eat and drink. In this context aguinaldos are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> songs.
This expression has also been used when describing a children‚Äôs custom in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> went knocking on doors and visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, asking for and receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX> or small toys. Sometimes they would sing a song that sounded more like a prayer or a chant, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Oremos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lottie Devine</ENAMEX> describes a custom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> where the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Day</TIMEX>, receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabados</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hymns</ENAMEX>)
Ancient religious hymns that praises the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Christ</ENAMEX>, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> word alabar means to praise, or to glorify, so most ala-bados start with the words ‚Äúalabado sea‚Äù (praised be). Alabados are usually sung with religious fervor, and many are extremely long with an indefinite number of verses. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penitentes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> were known to sing alabados during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenten</ENAMEX> rituals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Week</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processions</ENAMEX>, and other religious ceremonies. The songs are mystic in nature; many narrate the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christ‚</ENAMEX>Äôs life, his anguish, betrayal, his crucifixion and resurrection, and others praise the virtues of suffering and penance. Alabados were sung as ritual prayers in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX>, and at nightfall, and they were almost always sung at funeral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">processions</ENAMEX>. Their melodies are fusions of indigenous music and medieval chants. Stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican California narrate</ENAMEX> the singing of alabados first thing in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> in his/her own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, but all together at the same time. Like the d√©cima (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-line poetic song) and the romance (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-line song), alabados were introduced into the New World by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> padres, who taught them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as they were teaching them the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> and converting them to Christianity. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent times</TIMEX> alabados have come to mean any religious hymn sung at wakes or religious ceremonies. Many are very old and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> unknown, although a few collected in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> were written by a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>. Folklorists of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s and 1940s</TIMEX> were still able to collect some of these ancient hymns from elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who learned them from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Rael</ENAMEX> published <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the first essays on the alabado in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, and a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gonzalez</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Utah</ENAMEX>, calls them ‚Äúsome of the saddest music‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ingalls B11</ENAMEX>).

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alambrista</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illegal Border Crosser</ENAMEX>)
Literally, alambre is a wire, and an alambrista is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who uses alambre. The term has come to mean a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who crosses a wire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fence</ENAMEX>, regardless of the means or method. In this cultural usage the fence is the wire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fence</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> border, the term is interchangeable with mojado (wetback), which refers to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who enters the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> illegally by crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alambrista</ENAMEX> is not as common an expression as wetback, but it is used frequently by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> has produced many films about illegal entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> with many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> playing roles as alambristas. An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> with the title Alambrista! The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illegal</ENAMEX>, written and directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Young</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, deals with the issue of undocumented immigration by portraying the experiences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> man‚Äôs journey into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. It is considered a landmark film because of the authentic portrayal of a life of fear and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alienation</ENAMEX> experienced by the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.
Like the term wetback, this is an expression many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX> can identify with since many have family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> who have entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> through nonlegal means. It is part of the folklore repertoire of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> border is politically and culturally a constant element in everyday life.

Altars
An altar is a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> (depending on its size, sometimes called an altarcito, a little altar) established in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for the personal worship by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Home altars</ENAMEX> are common in many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. The word altar is derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> word altare, a combination of altus, high, and ara, altar, referring to a raised <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for worship, one that goes upward toward the sky or heaven. It provides a space where religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can communicate with God, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, or other spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beings</ENAMEX>. Home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">altars</ENAMEX> vary in size, from a small shelf with one votive candle and one saint or statue, to a large table altar, with many religious images, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, pictures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, candles; a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> that can fill up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">altars</ENAMEX> can be in a small nicho (niche) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>, the living room, or even the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Daily devout prayer, such as reciting the rosary or praying to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> or favorite saint, is a normal occurrence in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, with the prayers often led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>. A personal home altar may evolve over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of years</TIMEX>, rather than being constructed suddenly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>. When the creation is such a gradual process, it can reflect and almost chronicle the happy and tragic events that take place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. As family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are born, or die, their picture or a favorite personal item of theirs may be placed on the altar, along with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>, a votive candle, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Eventually, the altar can become so much a meaningful representation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that it will be maintained for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
The religious observation of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All Souls‚Äô Day, or D√≠a de los Muertos</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2</TIMEX>, is an occasion for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to erect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">altars</ENAMEX> specifically for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> or other family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> who has recently died. These altars will traditionally have a picture or pictures of the departed with offerings and gifts. Family and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are invited to visit and add items to the altar, which becomes almost a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, and is called an ofrenda. In many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> cities <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D√≠a de los Muertos</ENAMEX> ritual celebrations have become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> affairs that include more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and may entail a procession through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> ending at a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community center</ENAMEX>. In the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty or so years</TIMEX>, the creation and construction of altars have become major art programs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The altars are wonderful artistic creations, a form of folk art, with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> participating and involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the making of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calaveras</ENAMEX> (skeletons), papel picado (cut tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>), paper <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and other decorations.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> culture it is usually <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who develop home altars, as expressions of devotion, to pay homage to past family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and to find a space for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> prayer. It is thought that home altars were created as a result of community isolation from a centralized place of worship. After <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> gained its independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friars</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> there weren‚Äôt enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> to visit all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and rural areas. Isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> created their own places of worship. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wealthy</ENAMEX> or upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were able to build small chapels on their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX>, while the poorer classes built small nichos and altars in their homes, in kitchens or other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, for private prayer and devotion.

The southernmost regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, however, have always been more closely related to northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> in customs, language, and folklore. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S.-Mexican War</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1846‚Äì1848</NUMEX> and the signing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Gadsden Treaty</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1854</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> experienced the same cultural changes as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, although more gradually, since the region was not immediately overwhelmed by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo American</ENAMEX> invasion as the other areas were. Arizona‚Äôs oldest and most important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> has been <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>, founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1775</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucson</ENAMEX> was the frontier fortification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gadsden Purchase</ENAMEX> transferred it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. It functioned as a cavalry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outpost</ENAMEX> established in response to the many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> raids of the times. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> were a majority through most of the nineteenth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> had a bicultural spirit that was unique in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> middle class ran some of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, held political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>, funded private and public education, and created a prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> society envied by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, with elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teatro Carmen</ENAMEX> and Spanish-language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>. Tucson‚Äôs proximity to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>, permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucsonenses</ENAMEX> to remain close to their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> heritage. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Sheridan</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúThis <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> represented a local florescence of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin American</ENAMEX> civilization in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, its society and culture linking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> with the finest traditions of both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>). Although there was a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> middle class, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicanos</ENAMEX> were working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>, such as butchers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barbers</ENAMEX>, and later railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> arrived in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 20, 1880</TIMEX>, and this changed society in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> forever.
There has always been a substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>. The folklore of the region was recognized to be important, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margarite Collier</ENAMEX>, an elementary school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, organized a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folklore Club</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrillo School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>. An article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Daily Star</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 19, 1943</TIMEX>, states that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> was ‚Äúto help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> sustain pride and interest in the traditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> and folklore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and to perpetuate these customs among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish-speaking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Miss Collier</ENAMEX> taught the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> music, art, and folk dances of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every year</TIMEX> the school organized a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Posadas</ENAMEX> procession through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>. The same article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Daily Star</ENAMEX> describes this celebration, with the subtitle of the article stating, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúAncient Mexican Custom</ENAMEX> to be <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Encouraged in Ceremonial Here</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrillo School</ENAMEX> carried out this tradition until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folklore Club</ENAMEX> continued until <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miss Collier</ENAMEX> retired from teaching. Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collier</ENAMEX> worked at collecting songs, games, and other folklore from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Margarite Collier Collection</ENAMEX> of her private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> is housed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Folklore Archives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Griffith</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arizona</ENAMEX>, is probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> who has published the most on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> folklore. He has written several works on the traditional folk arts of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, a region that also includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pimas, Yaquis</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tohono O‚</ENAMEX>Äôodham <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> and borders the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX> state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffith</ENAMEX> writes about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> of the region, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard shrines</ENAMEX>, cascarones (decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">eggshells</ENAMEX>), religious practices, and the various musical traditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folklore</ENAMEX> collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Griffith‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> is also housed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Folklore Archives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Preciado Martin</ENAMEX>, born and raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, has written extensively about the folklore and traditional past of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>. She has collected oral histories and folktales from elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Americans</ENAMEX>, many of them born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. These oral histories nostalgically narrate the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the turn of the century</TIMEX>, describing the rural way of life on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle ranches</ENAMEX> and the early city life of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Sheridan</ENAMEX> has written a social history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1854 to 1941</TIMEX>, thoughtfully showing the social and cultural changes that occurred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucsonenses</ENAMEX> after the coming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo Americans</ENAMEX>. The religious and cultural life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is carefully researched and impartially presented. A very good description of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tucson‚Äôs Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> is provided in the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzanne Myal</ENAMEX>. An early publication of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> folklore is a collection of songs published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX> titled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canciones de Mi Padre</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luisa Espinel</ENAMEX>. An exhibit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arizona Museum of Art</ENAMEX> reviewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Kitchener</ENAMEX> shows the continuity between home and community <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> arts.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúAy Vienen los Yankees!‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Here Come the Yankees</ENAMEX>!)
This title of a song from early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> vividly expresses fear of the loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> culture. The song expresses an aversion to the cultural invasion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> along with a fear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> may like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankees</ENAMEX> too much. This song was collected in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hague</ENAMEX>, the ‚Äúwords date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX> or about that time‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">109</ENAMEX>). It is an example of a folk custom the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> used to convey their antipathy toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> culture. It goes like this: 

Ay vienen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">los Yankees</ENAMEX>,

Aztl√°n
According to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aztec</ENAMEX> legend, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√°n</ENAMEX> was the place from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexica Aztecas</ENAMEX> came, known as the place of emergence, in some codices identified as the ‚Äúseven-cave place.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexica Aztecs</ENAMEX> traveled south under the guidance of the god <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huitzilopochtli</ENAMEX>, who advised them to look for an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">eagle</ENAMEX> perched on a prickly <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pear cactus</ENAMEX>, devouring a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX>. This would be their new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, they were told, which they were to call <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenochtitl√°n.</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> starting calling the southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, or that portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> lost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">U.S.-Mexican War of 1846‚Äì1848, Aztl√</ENAMEX>°n, in reference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">legend of the wandering Mexica</ENAMEX>. The concept of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicanos</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aztl√°n</ENAMEX> was presented at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference</ENAMEX> held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>. It was articulated in the manifesto, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n</ENAMEX>, a document that outlined an ideology meant to unite all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. The document is accredited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alurista</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> who was already presenting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√</ENAMEX>°n in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> studies class he taught in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Diego State University</ENAMEX>. The manifesto stressed the concept of ethnic nationalism and self-determination, and of the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> to control their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. The document proclaims, ‚ÄúWe are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bronze People</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Culture</ENAMEX>. Before the world, before all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, before all our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> in the bronze continent, we are a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, we are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of free pueblos, we are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√°n.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Por</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Raza</ENAMEX> todo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fuera de La Raza</ENAMEX> nada.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù El Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n</ENAMEX> was published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Grito del Norte</ENAMEX>, Volume <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 1969</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> was started at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aztl√°n: Chicano Journal</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Sciences and the Arts</ENAMEX>, which is still published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
The eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Leal</ENAMEX> states that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√°n</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meanings for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>: the geographic region of the southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúthe spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>, something that is carried within the heart, no matter where they may live or where they may find themselves‚Äù (Leal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aztl√°n</ENAMEX> takes a prominent place in murals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art, and folklore, and it continues to appear in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> literature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, as it has for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>, in poetry, short stories, novels, and essay anthologies. The title of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudolfo Anaya‚</ENAMEX>Äôs novels is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart of Aztl√°n</ENAMEX>, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel Mendez</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilgrims</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aztl√</ENAMEX>°n <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, later translated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alurista</ENAMEX> has a poetry collection titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Floricanto en Aztl√°n</ENAMEX>, published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>.
Aztl√°n is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>, especially for those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coming of age</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>, who wanted to create a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> that they could call their own. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Chicanos</ENAMEX> born in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> is not home, but neither is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√</ENAMEX>°n is looked upon as the mythical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>. The affiliation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√°n</ENAMEX> also reaffirms the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos‚</ENAMEX>Äô identity as mestizos (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of mixed ancestry), as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>. Chicano <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> explore the various meanings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztl√</ENAMEX>°n in an anthology edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudolfo Anaya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Lomel√</ENAMEX>≠ titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aztl√°n: Essays on the Chicano Homeland</ENAMEX>.
