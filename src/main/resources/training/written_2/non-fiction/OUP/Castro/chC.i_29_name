<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabeza de Baca, Fabiola</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1894‚Äì1991</ENAMEX>)
Born in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 16, 1894</TIMEX> (although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> give her birth date as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fabiola Cabeza de Baca</ENAMEX> became a famous home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, folklorist, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX>. She was one of several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleofas M. Jaramillo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Otero-Warren</ENAMEX>, who wrote of the culture and heritage of their Hispano ancestors. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> came from long-established <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who had been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 200 years</TIMEX>. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> raised her from the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, after her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> died, leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fabiola</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>. She attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loretto Academy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> and after graduating from high school became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> in a rural area <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six miles</NUMEX> from her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">father‚Äôs ranch</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Liendre</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX> she received a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.</ENAMEX> degree from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico Normal</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico Highlands University</ENAMEX>) and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.S.</ENAMEX> in home economics from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico State University</ENAMEX>). In between she also spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> studying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
For over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> she worked as an extension <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, teaching the traditional ways of preparing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> and emphasizing the nutritional value in the native diet. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of her books, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Historic Cookery and The Good Life</ENAMEX>, depict the way of life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispanos</ENAMEX> in the late nineteenth and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early twentieth centuries</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We Fed Them Cactus</ENAMEX> she presents a biography and ethnography of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, especially her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and a curandera, and retells the stories narrated to her by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. She depicts the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> on the llano (plains) of western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX>, and also that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglos</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX>, the loss of land, the fencing-in of the plains, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the era</TIMEX> with the death of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. The title of the book refers to the custom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> of feeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> cactus to keep them alive during droughts. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Good Life</ENAMEX>, not a long book, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabeza de Baca</ENAMEX> creates a fictional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turrietas</ENAMEX>, and uses their story to narrate the rituals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lent</ENAMEX>, marriage, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> are presented, along with many recipes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> prepared for these celebrations. She wrote many articles for various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1959</TIMEX> she retired but continued to work giving lectures, writing, and acting as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX>. She died at the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 14, 1991</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genaro Padilla</ENAMEX> refers to her writing as ‚Äúfolkloric autobiography,‚Äù a significant genre, since it is one of the few kinds of writing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispanos</ENAMEX> that depicts the life they either experienced or learned from their ancestors at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>. Her folkloric work is extremely important because she wrote about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and how their complicated and elaborate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> work so profoundly maintained the culture and traditions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispanos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabeza de Baca</ENAMEX> was an active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of many community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico Folklore Society</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calavera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skeleton</ENAMEX>)
A bony skeleton and/or the skull of a skeleton. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">calavera</ENAMEX> has become the symbol of the downtrodden, who must laugh at life in order to survive it. It is also used to mean a drunkard or a very stupid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>. During the celebrations of the holy day <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D√≠a de los Muertos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy skulls</ENAMEX> are made and sold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bakeries</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. These skulls may be placed on home altars or given as gifts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">printmaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Guadalupe Posada</ENAMEX> started drawing calaveras during the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX> to coincide with this holiday. Their popularity is primarily attributed to him and his work. His images of calaveras have been reproduced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of times and can be found year-round, but especially during celebrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D√≠a de los Muertos</ENAMEX>. Posada printed many calaveras during the period of the presidency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porfirio D√≠az</ENAMEX> and during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX>. He introduced the humorous satirical calavera that showed the objectionable side of life, that engaged in regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> activities such as eating, dancing, drinking, fighting, enjoying life, and being a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> concept of death is exemplified in the satiric antics of the calavera and this perspective is also found in the art, literature, and performance arts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX>. Calaveras are depicted dancing, drinking in cantinas (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>), crowding and falling out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, and playing instruments in musical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Teatro Campesino</ENAMEX> in its performances always has a calavera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> that either represents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Muerte</ENAMEX> (death) or typifies a disturbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alter ego</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> tradition of the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX> was the publication of a poetic broadside that was called a calavera. Published before or during the festivities of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">D√≠a de los Muertos</ENAMEX>, these calaveras carried poems that poked fun at socially prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> and the very wealthy. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calaveras</ENAMEX>, such as the poems, were printed in newspapers, but most were small pamphlets or single sheets that were sold on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. For a small fee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> to write a calavera for them and draw a skeleton to go with it. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tinker</ENAMEX>, ‚Äútheir main functions are to remind us in a good-humored way that we all are mortal, and to poke fun at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and attack public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. These last are supposed to take it all in good grace. Calaveras are still published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every November 1</TIMEX> in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tinker 1961</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>). The calavera is now an integral element of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> folk art and it adorns murals, stationery, postcards, party invitations and decorations, and even religious art.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Califas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>)
An in<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> name for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> used continuously since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 1940</TIMEX>. It was originally used by the pachucos (1940s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX>) in the jargon they developed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los</ENAMEX> referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, which was also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Losca</ENAMEX>, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. Barker‚Äôs glossary of pachuco words from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> shows that the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Califa</ENAMEX>, without the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">s</ENAMEX>, was used to mean a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> continue to refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Califas</ENAMEX>, when speaking of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, in an affectionate and proprietary manner. The name can be found in art and literature as well as in academic and official documents. Not infrequently the return address on an envelope will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Califas, Aztl√°n.</ENAMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Folklore</ENAMEX>
The settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonizers happened much later than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> mission was established in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1769, 200 years</TIMEX> after the exploration of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> great difference was that many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> came by way of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, so many of them represented a mestizo (mixed-race) culture rather than a purely sixteenth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> culture, as the earlier explorers had. Many were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> Spaniards and of course did not bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> language and culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> with them. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> language and culture had evolved into a slightly New World variant.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> did not grow much during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighteenth century</TIMEX>, and after the independence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> culture quickly declined in the region. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spaniards</ENAMEX> left the region, and the great migration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo American</ENAMEX> gold <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> took place, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> culture and language could not survive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> as it did in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Californio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of the state represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 5 percent</NUMEX>. It wasn‚Äôt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>, with the beginnings of a revolution in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> large wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> immigration was felt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>.
In discussing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispano</ENAMEX> folklore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aurelio M. Espinosa</ENAMEX>, the foremost <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folklorist</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early twentieth century</TIMEX>, delineated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanics</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Spaniards</ENAMEX> who settled the region in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighteenth century</TIMEX> and their descendents, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Californios</ENAMEX>, who represented the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> traditions that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Espinosa</ENAMEX> most wanted to study. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> who continued to migrate into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth century</TIMEX>, and these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espinosa</ENAMEX> delicately put it, were ‚Äúgente de mas <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">baja condici√≥n y cultura‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of a lower condition and culture) (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">301</NUMEX>). And <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, as he wrote his study in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, he found many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spaniards</ENAMEX> who had recently immigrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√</ENAMEX>≠a in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and who represented a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> from a different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, and not that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Californios</ENAMEX>. As he states, he collected romances from the true <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Californios</ENAMEX>, mostly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterey</ENAMEX> region. In addition, he collected folktales, proverbs, ballads, and other lore, which were published in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">California Folklore Quarterly</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</TIMEX>.
A renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Spanish</ENAMEX> folklore in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles F. Lummis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1859‚Äì1928</ENAMEX>), a self-taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX>, ethnologist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicologist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalist</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lummis ‚Äúdiscovered‚</ENAMEX>Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s and 1890s</TIMEX> and became enamored of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> way of life, especially of their ‚Äúhospitality, courtesy, and respect for age‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Heisley 60</NUMEX>). He collected oral traditions, specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> songs, from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and felt an urgency to record them before they disappeared. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Museum</ENAMEX> holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of songs he recorded on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">wax</NUMEX> cylinders, songs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> languages from southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. He equated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> songs with the romantic past of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californios</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> and felt almost a nostalgic fascination for early <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> history and the era of the large ranchos. In his own words, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Romance</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish Romance</ENAMEX>. Everybody knows that who knows anything‚Äù (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1923b, 9</ENAMEX>).
Although not a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">folklorist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Rojas</ENAMEX> writes of the vaquero (cowboy) culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Joaquin Valley</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> and into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first third</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1900s</TIMEX>. He describes the life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> vaqueros, how their lives were spent working on large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tejon Ranch</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kern County Land Co.</ENAMEX> Their lives were very narrowly focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> and ranch life and they all spoke mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>. In his reminiscences of vaquero culture and of the impact <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> Sonorans had on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojas</ENAMEX> shows a side of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> culture not commonly known. Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, where his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> were also born, it is clear he loved the life he lived. He writes of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Llorona and Joaqu√≠n Murrieta, and of Tiburcio V√°squez</ENAMEX>, who once gave <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> when they were fleeing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gringos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
There are no overall written accounts or collections of the oral traditions and folklore of the early <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Californios</ENAMEX> as we have of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hispanos</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angustias de la Guerra, Ord‚Äôs Occurrences</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, she describes some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, but her work was not intended to preserve for history the way of life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Californios</ENAMEX>. Glimpses of customs, games, dances, theater, and other traditions can be found in the writings of early western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, although these were often depicted prejudicially and with a lack of historical context. Spanish-language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> from the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX> exhibit folk customs and traditions. The folklore collected from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Americans</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twentieth century</TIMEX>, even if it‚Äôs from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX>- or fourth-generation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicano</ENAMEX>, generally will be folklore from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> transplanted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> fleeing a revolutionary war, or those coming to work in the agriculture fields. Of course it could also originate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, since there has been much migration into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> from those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Folktales, jests, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> songs, corridos (ballads), and customs related to religious and secular holidays, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>, and other folk traditions found in contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> will have a lot in common with those found in other southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> have taken an active interest in folklore in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX>, and archives established at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at Berkeley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> hold growing collections of many genres of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican American</ENAMEX> folklore. There are published collections from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX> of folk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine rituals</ENAMEX> and folk narratives collected primarily from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> area, but there is still much fieldwork to be done in this area.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cal√≥</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> Slang)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cal√≥</ENAMEX> comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy</ENAMEX> word zincal√≥, which is one of the idioms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsies</ENAMEX>. It is a very old argot influenced by many languages, including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>, and was spoken by the gypsies of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. It was brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conquistadores</ENAMEX>, where it continued to be identified as the language of the poor, the uneducated, and also the criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. Cal√≥ became the dialect of the underworld of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> and migrated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, as some believe, through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>.
Published studies of the speech of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> investigate the diverse communication modes by examining the language that reflects the cultural experiences of the various subcultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Some of these idioms are the pachuco dialect, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chicano Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vocabulary</ENAMEX>, cal√≥, and the argot of the tirilones of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>. The pachuco dialect has been especially influenced by cal√≥; it was and still is primarily a male speech and if used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> they were considered to be street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or girlfriends of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang members</ENAMEX>. Today, however, many words from cal√≥ are fully integrated into the standard -vocabulary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chicano Spanish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> incorporate it into poetry, short stories, and novels. What makes cal√≥ and its appropriation into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chicano Spanish</ENAMEX> distinct is its use by working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos and Mexicanos</ENAMEX>. It is a shared language across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> border, equally used on both sides.
The vocabulary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chicano Spanish</ENAMEX> is congested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX> words, words from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pachuco era</TIMEX>, and consequently heavily influenced by cal√≥. Chicanos have a sense of pride in being aware of these words and expressions, and knowing how to use them. There are many studies that examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> spoken by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos</ENAMEX> and several published dictionaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chicano Spanish</ENAMEX> and of cal√≥. Most of the studies provide examples of the male use of cal√≥, but there is recent research that shows that female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cholas</ENAMEX> and pachucas also have an extensive vocabulary in cal√≥. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galindo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> show the social importance of cal√≥ in conveying a ‚Äúsense of intimacy and camaraderie between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who shared similar life experiences and acquaintances‚Äù (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>).
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> published dictionary of cal√≥, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Rosensweig</ENAMEX>, presents cal√≥ in a rather harsh manner, referring to it as gutter <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, which prompted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to take the privilege of writing a comment on the title page of the book. This example of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúbook graffiti‚Äù</ENAMEX> is presented here because it is an excellent example of the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chicano Spanish</ENAMEX> influenced by cal√≥ and used at an opportune moment:
Este gabacho <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pendejo y su pinche</ENAMEX> libro no valen <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ni un</ENAMEX> coraje
‚Äîque vaya a agarrar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">las nalgas a la puta que le pari√≥</ENAMEX>.
(This stupid gringo and his f‚Äî book aren‚Äôt worth anger;
he can go grab the buttocks of the whore that gave him birth.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúLa Vida de un Bato Loco</ENAMEX>,‚Äù written by an informant of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Katz</ENAMEX> and reproduced in her work, provides a good example of the literary uses of cal√≥. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katz</ENAMEX> includes a glossary of the cal√≥ words used in the story.

Campa, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Leon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1905‚Äì1978</ENAMEX>)
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folklorists</ENAMEX> who have spent their careers studying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> songs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> theater, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, traditions, and folkways of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Leon Campa</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> in his study of the folklore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> primarily of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>. His great achievement and comprehensive work, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> Culture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, was published in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> after his death. Campa was born on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 20, 1905</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guaymas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early years</TIMEX> were spent mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baja</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonora</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Campa</ENAMEX>, was a lieutenant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Army</ENAMEX> and was killed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pancho Villa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionaries</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delfia Lopez de la O</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-born, returned with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> they settled in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>, and later she moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albuquerque</ENAMEX>, where she opened a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and restaurant.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Campa</ENAMEX> earned a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1928</TIMEX>) and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.A.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX>) from the -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and a Ph.D. from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campa</ENAMEX> taught at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of New Mexico</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1932 to 1942</TIMEX>, and again after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945 to 1946</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX> he became the chair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Modern Languages and Literature</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>, and he stayed there until he retired in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campa</ENAMEX> wrote <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> books, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> bulletins, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> articles, mostly about folklore, but also on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX> language. He considered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> Culture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> his most important achievement. This comprehensive work is a cultural history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> border <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camposanto</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cemetery</ENAMEX>)
The place where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicanos and Mexicanos</ENAMEX> bury their dead is called a camposanto, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúholy field‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfield of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use the better-known term cementerio, meaning ‚Äúcemetery,‚Äù camposanto is a word still used in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictionaries</ENAMEX> define the word as a ‚Äúcemetery for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX>,‚Äù whereas they define cementerio as an ‚Äúenclosed place for burying the dead.‚Äù
Camposantos are important in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chicano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and the concept of death is always present in personal narratives, songs, and in the religious holy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> observed. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El D√≠a de los Muertos</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All Souls‚Äô Day</ENAMEX>, is a religious and folk holy day that is devoutly celebrated; it usually includes a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> cleans the grave sites of loved ones, sets up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and candles, and visits with and prays for the departed. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the year</TIMEX>, attendance to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial sites</ENAMEX> does not diminish, and graves are kept decorated and colorful.
During the colonial period of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Spain</ENAMEX>, burials were made within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> itself, as was the tradition in medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> were allowed to be buried in the missionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, whereas the mestizos (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of mixed race) and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> were buried in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camposanto</ENAMEX> located in front or to the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. By the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteenth century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> forbade additional burials inside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, supposedly for public health reasons, but the ricos, the well-to-do, continued to buy their way into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. So the camposantos were still left for the poor mestizos. A recognizable sign of a colonial frontier camposanto was a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight-foot</NUMEX> wooden cross that stood in the front or center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>. Some can still be found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in rural parts of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>. Another feature that can also still be found in parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> is segregation and isolation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> cemeteries. Many were located side by side but were fenced off and had separate entrances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> chosen for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camposantos</ENAMEX> were often on tierra muerta, barren land that was too poor to cultivate.
Cemetery and graveyard decorating traditions have been researched and written about as a means of appreciating and understanding <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> folk beliefs about death and grieving. The adornment of grave sites reflects religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> practices, and ethnic and family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> about death and remembrance. Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> include decorating and designing a space that will be revisited by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. The intent is to keep the deceased <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> alive in the family‚Äôs memory. Some design motifs that are distinctive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicano</ENAMEX> cemeteries are the construction and design of crosses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Jordan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> book has an illustration of twelve different ‚Äúsubtypes of wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> crosses found on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mexican graves in Texas‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">78</NUMEX>). In the nineteenth and even into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">twentieth century crosses</ENAMEX> were built of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, but these didn‚Äôt last long, being destroyed either by the elements or by vandalism. More common <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are crosses made of molded concrete. Many grave sites have a cerquito, a low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX>, or concrete fence, an enclosure that surrounds an individual grave. Another common trait is to construct a cement grave marker, with a nicho (niche) built into it, so that the statue of a saint, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Virgen de Guadalupe</ENAMEX>, or a photograph of the deceased can be placed in it. Sometimes a concrete cross will have a nicho built into its base for the same purpose. Although fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are often placed at grave sites, paper and plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are more common. Colorful plastic wreaths are sometimes attached to the wooden or cement cross. Another dis-tinguishing feature in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicano</ENAMEX> camposantos is the wide range of materials used in decorating a grave. As with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home yard shrines</ENAMEX> and home altars, everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> are used as personal and artistic statements. It is often in the performance of highly charged personal rituals that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> create folklore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art, and folk music.
Many grave markers are brightly painted, and some even have religious scenes painted on them. This tradition has been linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs indigenous heritage, for, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Jordan</ENAMEX> states, ‚ÄúSuch use of color in a sacred context has ample pre-Columbian precedent in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, where even the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> once bore bright paints‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80</NUMEX>). He goes on to say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúHispanic graveyards</ENAMEX> are places of color, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and tiles combine to comfort the bereaved and startle the gringo‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">88</NUMEX>).
