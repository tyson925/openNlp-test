In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX> has come to assert itself in the opinions, particularly the dissenting opinions, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. If we are to understand the impact of our implicit postbellum commitment to the ideas of nationhood, democracy, and equality, we cannot limit ourselves to the jurisprudence of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> who happen to sit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX> has, in fact, a much deeper grounding in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> political and legal culture, and it has come to express itself in diverse arenas. It spontaneously percolates through civil society. It shapes the process of constitutional amendment; indeed, virtually every constitutional amendment enacted since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX> expresses, in one way or another, the values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX>. This is true as well of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> leading proposed constitutional amendments that have gained a large political following in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>: the proposal to protect the flag against <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúdesecration‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the movement to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of crime. The values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX> have also found their way into subconstitutional federal legislation based, as a technical matter, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interstate Commerce Clause</ENAMEX>, granting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> authority to regulate commerce ‚Äúamong the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚</ENAMEX>Äù1 The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> defeat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Civil Rights Act of 1866</ENAMEX> meant that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had to find other means of bringing to bear the same set of values in the pursuit of equal treatment in public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and in the workplace. In order to see the resurgence of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> great ideas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Secret Constitution‚Äînationhood</ENAMEX>, democracy, and equality‚Äîwe have to look afield, away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, to these diverse areas that give birth to legal trends and define the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bedrock</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>.2


Constitutional Amendments

Of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">arenas</ENAMEX> in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX> has come to the fore, none is more impressive than the process of constitutional amendment. All of the amendments adopted and ratified over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 135 years</TIMEX> reveal the traces of a shared understanding, an unconscious plan, of what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should be like. This is a remarkable thesis, for the general tendency is to assume that the amendments consist in a hodgepodge of special responses to unrelated problems.
The dominant theme is the spread of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> and the fine-tuning of the system of democratic representation. But there are other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX> as well. As we work our way through the amendments, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirteenth</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty-Seventh</ENAMEX>, we shall also see a countervailing principle at work. Democracy stresses the responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for their self-governance. The offsetting principle is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> must be strong, well financed, and act with a sense of compassion for the weak and defenseless. Our postbellum commitment to democracy is well known. Less well appreciated is the deep <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> sense of concern for those who are not able to fend for themselves. The final implication, then, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX> is the commitment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to the dignity and self-esteem of all its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>.
If we think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> as a moral drama, we cannot but perceive a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> at work that is committed to the dignity of all. The drama can be narrowly understood as an enormous sacrifice of human life to liberate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> held in the most demeaning condition imaginable. The war snuffed out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> life, one being created in the image of God, for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX> freed. There might have been a less costly way of solving the problem. Simply waiting and negotiating, we might have seen the market itself render the keeping of slaves too costly an enterprise. Industrialization spreading <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> might have made <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfree labor‚</ENAMEX>Äù a more appealing alternative for those who profited from the system of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> labor. The end of plantation capitalism might have come as safely as the demise of communism in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. But these possible scenarios are beside the point. The sacrifice did occur. And we thought it was necessary, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> preached, to cleanse us of our ‚Äúoffences‚Äù and to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> a ‚Äúnew birth of freedom.‚Äù We could not have survived this drama with anything but a sense that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was capable of a great moral undertaking. Government was no longer instituted simply to keep the peace, deliver the mail, and protect us from foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> but also to ensure that we not descend into the kind of evil that seared the soul of the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Republic</ENAMEX>. The period of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> witnessed legislative measures that had never been seen before in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States‚</ENAMEX>Äîthe beginning of a national banking system, the issuance of a national currency, a homestead act that distributed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">160 acres</NUMEX> to each settler, and land grants for building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>. We incorporated this new understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Thirteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>, which declared boldly that the particular kind of evil that had led to war would never again exist in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. To prevent this reoccurrence, the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> would have to be strong and vigilant. It would have to observe the transactions that occurred in the marketplace to ensure that they did not approach the danger zone of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúinvoluntary servitude</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The war itself and this consequent postbellum policy of necessary vigilance laid the foundation for the later expressions of compassion for the weak and defenseless.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirteenth</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>, however, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1865 to 1870</TIMEX>, we can sense a sharp decline in the moral energy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment</ENAMEX> contains, of course, the invocations of ‚Äúprivileges and immunities,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚</ENAMEX>Äúdue process,‚Äù and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúequal protection‚Äù</ENAMEX> that have engaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and its academic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX>. But implicit in this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX> amendment is the resurgence of the states‚Äô responsibility for the events that occur within their borders. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sections 2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> of the amendment contain time-specific provisions designed to penalize the disloyal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and rebel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. These vengeful provisions have caused much mischief, as we have seen, by providing fodder <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> for those who prefer denying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> to convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX>.3 Still, the equal protection clause was a breakthrough and supplied the anchor for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> principle of the postbellum legal order. And the due process clause would prove to be the umbrella that would enable the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last half-century</TIMEX>, to develop a jurisprudence of human rights that applies to the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
The framing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifteenth Amendment</ENAMEX> suffered from the loss of moral ambition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> could have drafted the amendment simply to require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 21</TIMEX>. But that would have required a clear rationale for the democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX>, a clear principle telling us who should vote and why. At the most, we had a vague commitment to the new idea of democracy for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>. The women‚Äôs suffrage movement had begun but it had little support. And it was not at all clear that emancipated slaves would receive the vote. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> were naturally fearful that the newly enfranchised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> would vote for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> that promoted their liberation. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> pressed both for the vote for former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX> and for the disenfranchisement of disloyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederacy</ENAMEX>. A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX>, they hoped, would break the power of the landed √©lite and bring about a social revolution in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> himself identified with the class of small white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX>, who felt threatened by the potential rise of black political power in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>.
These political considerations played themselves out against ambivalent sentiments about who constituted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpeople‚Äù</ENAMEX> in ‚Äúgovernment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Yet, we should not underappreciate the radical step of granting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> to emancipated slaves on the same terms as it was available to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This transformation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave population</ENAMEX> was unique in the history of revolutionary wars. The concept of popular democracy was beginning to take root. We should not forget that despite pretensions of a democratic founding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX>, the idea that more than a dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">√</ENAMEX>©lite should vote was as foreign to the mind of the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteenth century</TIMEX> as were the terms ‚ÄúAmerican nation‚Äù and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúequality</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Rule</ENAMEX> by the demos or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> was, like equality, still unfolding as a way of life. It had no guiding theory‚Äîno rationale and no historical model. It was not at all obvious that the uneducated, propertyless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> should govern the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
The entire constitutional structure drafted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX> needed revamping but, without a compelling theory to guide them, the political powers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> settled for the modest demand in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifteenth Amendment</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> not deny the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> ‚Äúon account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.‚Äù It is hard to imagine a lesser demand on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, consistent with the policy of treating the emancipated slaves as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> with equal political rights.
The ensuing amendments also pursue the principles latent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sixteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>, ratified after a lapse of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forty-five years</TIMEX>, recognized the legitimacy of the income tax. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> had already experimented with the income tax during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>, and enacted another tax in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1890s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> initially upheld the imposition of an income tax<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX> but then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> vetoed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> votes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, the new aspirations of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> The rationale for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Court‚Äôs</ENAMEX> intervention was an obscure <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">provision on ‚Äúdirect‚Äù and ‚Äúindirect‚</ENAMEX>Äù taxes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX> that had gotten in the way of the new vision of government<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Seventeenth Amendment</ENAMEX> brings us back to the process of developing a democratic system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Henceforth, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> would have to be elected not by state legislatures but directly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The tone of the amendment remains deferential to the states‚Äô control of the electoral process, even for national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. The text does not tell us that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> should be entitled to vote but leaves it up to each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to decide who shall be able to vote ‚Äúfor the most numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Whatever that standard happens to be will prevail as well for elections to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Senate</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Eighteenth Amendment</ENAMEX> is the most significant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX>, for once again we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> in action a government solicitous of the welfare of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of this amendment is exactly the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirteenth</ENAMEX>. As the latter declares that a certain form of private relationship of subordination shall not exist in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Eighteenth Amendment</ENAMEX> tells us, analogously, that another private relationship shall not occur: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äúthe</ENAMEX> manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within . . . the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> . . . is hereby prohibited.‚Äù This much misunderstood amendment, ratified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>, expressed a collective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for the dignity and welfare of all those whose lives were destroyed by drink. Of course, we know that it did not work, but the sentiment expressed was a noble <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. It reflects a politics of mutual responsibility in a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for those who could easily get lost in the rough and tumble of capitalist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.
We encounter this noble motive at work and see its failure in our current policy toward the sale and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX>. We deploy vast sums and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in an effort to halt the spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> usage, although it is hard to see any tangible payoff from our investment. The reason is simple. It is not easy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to interdict the pleasures of those who can satisfy them through purely private transactions. The level of vigilance required exceeds the capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in a society that also seeks to protect privacy and civil liberties.
In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>, in particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> had the effect of making consumption tantalizing and exciting. The speak-easy, the drink on the sly, the home brew‚Äîall these brought extra pleasure to those who imbibed. The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> was much the same as in the case of flag burning. The law‚Äôs forbidding the act makes it more thrilling. The effect is just the opposite of that intended.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Therein</ENAMEX> lies a message for the politics of governmental intervention. There are times when we must rely on civil society to achieve our goals‚Äîsometimes with a slight nudge from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Witness the turnaround that has occurred in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> with regard to cigarette smoking. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> posted health warnings on cigarette packs, required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> and governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> to ban smoking, but did not try to follow the model of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> or the drug laws. The policy of deferring to voluntary initiative has been more effective. A revolution in attitudes toward smoking has occurred, largely because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were free, in effect, to decide for themselves in their homes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and other spheres of influence. They did not need the coercive force of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> behind them.
For many, the limitations on governmental power represent a trivial and self-evident proposition. But those who believe in the power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, as I do, should pay heed. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX>, who are generally skeptical of the power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, would do well to ponder the analogies between <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> and the drive for prayer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> or the criminalization of flag burning. Of course, there are some areas, such as the protection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of crime, where only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can act. Of that problem there will be more to say later.
Allow me to take the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> out of order. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> realized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> simply could not act upon its noble motives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> had to be amended once more, this time to countermand the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Eighteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, retained <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many more years</TIMEX>. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> from ostensibly dry <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> once jibed, ‚ÄúProhibition is better than no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX> at all.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as a whole finally decided, however, that a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX> was more desirable than the costs to freedom in trying to achieve <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX>.
The rest of the amendments, beginning with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nineteenth</ENAMEX>, are all directed to the process of spreading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> and refining the mechanism of democratic representation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nineteenth</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty-Fourth</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>), and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sixth Amendments</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>) all serve the purpose of extending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX>. The drafting style follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifteenth Amendment</ENAMEX> by specifying the criterion on account of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> may not limit or abridge the right to vote. By using this negative formulation, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the series finally extends suffrage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to those who have not paid a poll tax or any other tax required to vote, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 18</TIMEX>. Also in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty-Third Amendment</ENAMEX>, which extends the right to vote for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> otherwise qualified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>.
These amendments bespeak the philosophical principles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX>. A clear commitment to a universal right to vote finally takes hold. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> attaches not to those with qualifications, education, wealth, age, or even the supposed superiority that, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> enjoyed in practical affairs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> belongs to all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and even to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident noncitizens</ENAMEX> who are capable of knowing, in the minimal theory of democratic voting, when ‚Äúthe shoe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pinches</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù7 Lincoln‚</ENAMEX>Äôs vision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> ‚Äúby all the people‚Äù was becoming the law of the land.
Also, elections for the presidency begin to take on the quality of a national referendum in place of a compilation of preferences by the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> started voting and expressing themselves as the voice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. Thus, it came to be obvious that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> who did not reside in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> (namely, those in the federal district) must also have the right to vote for national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> nominally retained the electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> as a way of giving lip service to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, but it is clear that the popular vote expresses the will of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. This became clear in the presidential election of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, discussed in detail in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afterword</ENAMEX>. On the basis of the results certified on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 26</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> acquired a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> vote majority in the electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore‚</ENAMEX>Äôs persistent legal challenge to the certified result depended, in part, on the sense of legitimacy he acquired from winning the confidence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> in the popular vote.
The remaining constitutional amendments fine-tune the workings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the presidency. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth</ENAMEX> shortens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the lameduck period</TIMEX> between the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> election and the change of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>. Previously the inauguration was prescribed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of March</TIMEX>, but the amendment moved up the date to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 3</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 20</TIMEX> for the presidency. Although this amendment appears simply to address matters of the calendar, it came into play recently in the dispute about whether an outgoing lameduck <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> could, in the period between election and going out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, constitutionally impeach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Ackerman</ENAMEX> shocked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital</ENAMEX> by testifying before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> that the newly seated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> could not constitutionally try the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> on an impeachment passed by the outgoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>.8 The amendment also authorizes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to prescribe a mode of succession to the presidency between elections.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Twenty-Second Amendment</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>) limits the term of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-year</TIMEX> terms plus a maximum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> inherited from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> unable to complete his term. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty-Fifth</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>) regulates in detail the problem of transition when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is still alive but incapable of executing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. The last amendment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty-Seventh</ENAMEX>, prohibits congressionally legislated pay raises from taking effect until another national election has taken place, and a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is sworn in. This last revision of the national charter also testifies to the theme of improving the workings of popular democracy: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> must be consulted before their elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> should be allowed to raise their own salaries. The curious twist in this last addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> is that although it was finally ratified by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-fourths</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, it was originally proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Madison</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two hundred years earlier</TIMEX>. Its formal roots lie in the original <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX>.
The amendments to the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution</ENAMEX> all bespeak the same pattern of realizing the implicit postbellum commitment to nationhood, democracy, and equality. The realization of these values in the amendments bespeaks the resurgence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX>.


Compassion for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victims</ENAMEX>

The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of our basic rights favors those who act‚Äîthose who speak, assemble, worship, carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, keep their homes private, or stretch their liberties to the point that the state charges them with criminal offenses. The attention paid to the rights of criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> is extraordinary. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments</ENAMEX> address the rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX>, and those convicted of crime. Noticeably absent in this catalogue of rights is due regard for those who suffer from the constitutionally protected actions of others. Our liberties entail costs, but for some reason the human beings who bear these costs are left outside of the constitutional equation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> have no rights. They are mentioned nowhere.
Indifference toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> began to change with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Thirteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who must bear the cross of involuntary servitude became the focus of attention. They would no longer suffer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> had the duty to protect them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> also asserted its duty to protect the weak in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Prohibition Amendment</ENAMEX>, but, alas, the duty to help others is not always easily realized. Yet, the idea that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should protect the weak, that it should tender compassion for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, became a mainstay of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX>.
Of course, no one is constitutionally protected in the action of committing a crime. The rights attach to those suspected of crime. The purpose of the amendments is to insure both that innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> will not be convicted but just as critically to protect the dignity of every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> as he or she falls under the investigative and prosecuting power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. For example, the privilege against self-incrimination goes beyond the protection of the innocent to speak to the dignity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> who may remain silent. Similarly, the protection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> often deters the efficiency of law enforcement, but only for the sake of promoting personal privacy. So long as we recognize that the constitutional provisions are interlaced with dignity concerns, then we cannot properly disregard the claims of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> to be treated in the same way. The victims‚Äô rights movement focuses, therefore, on increasing the participation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> in various stages of the process. Participation itself helps enhance the dignity of the victim by allowing him or her to be heard and to feel respected as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>.
The most common problem faced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> is that they are not allowed to attend the trials of those who have allegedly assaulted or raped them or killed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy McVeigh</ENAMEX> for bombing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Murrah Federal Building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> and killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> provides dramatic proof of indifference to discrimination against the interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. First, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Matsch</ENAMEX> changed the venue of the trial from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>, which of course made it much more difficult for the murdered victims‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to attend the trial. The nominal reason for the change of venue was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McVeigh</ENAMEX> was more likely to receive an unbiased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> in a city <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several hundred miles</NUMEX> away. The likelihood of finding potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> or anywhere else in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, unaffected by the intensive media coverage of the bombing was thought to be minimal. The other factor influencing the judge‚Äôs decision to relocate the trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> was the politely undiscussed fact that he owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>. It suited his personal interests to be close to home.
If the change of venue was not bad enough, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matsch</ENAMEX> also banned the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> who braved the journey from sitting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> during the trial. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> to wait outside if they are likely to be called later in the trial, but in this case the defense prevailed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> to bar the victims‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> on the ground that their very presence might induce an emotional response in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>. This decision, we might say, represented the nadir of compassion for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intervened to guarantee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> who have suffered direct physical, emotional, or financial harm the right to observe the trial by closed circuit television<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX>
A more compassionate approach to victims‚Äô rights became evident in the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O. J. Simpson</ENAMEX> case, which held the country‚Äôs rapt attention for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996 and 1997</TIMEX>. In the pretrial skirmishes, the defense objected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicole Brown Simpson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Goldman</ENAMEX>, remaining in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> if they might later be called as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcia Clark</ENAMEX> won the argument in the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, actually with some help from a book I had just published on victims‚Äô rights. Whether his words did the trick or not, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> could not help but enjoy hearing them enter into the deliberations. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> read them in the debate: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúThe minimal task of the criminal trial is to stand by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, to restore their dignity, to find a way for them to think of themselves, once again, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> equal to all others.‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Äù10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ito</ENAMEX> made the right decision to let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. If they were later called as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>, the defense could adequately protect itself by cross-examining the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> about testimony previously heard.
<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are also wary of allowing potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> to hear the testimony of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> before they testify (they put less faith in cross-examination), but they take strong measures to protect the interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> at trial. The typical pattern is to allow the victim to join the proceedings either as a civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plaintiff</ENAMEX> suing simultaneously for tort damages or as a coprosecutor arguing and presenting the case alongside the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> want to improve the position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> at trial, but none of them dares go so far as to suggest reforms comparable to accepted practice on the Continent.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> movement favoring compassion for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of crime has found expression in a variety of low-visibility measures. The constitutional amendment, sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Kyl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Feinstein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, sought to introduce the following rights:

To be notified of the proceedings
To attend all public proceedings
To be heard at certain crucial stages in the process
To be notified of the offender‚Äôs release or escape
To consideration for a trial free from unreasonable delay
To an order of restitution
To have the safety of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> considered in determining a release from custody
To be notified of these rights and to have standing to enforce them

So far as it goes, the proposed amendment makes sense. It expresses the spirit of compassion rooted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX>. It expresses the same sentiments that led to other initiatives to protect the weak and defenseless. Although each of the constitutional efforts to intervene on behalf of the powerless has a different impulse and a different agenda, they all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> from a root concern for those who are not strong enough to act for themselves. This is the common thread that begins in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Thirteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>, peaks, perhaps wrongly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX>, and issues <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> into the movement ‚Äúto stand by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, to restore their dignity, to find a way for them to think of themselves, once again, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> equal to all others.‚Äù
The opposition to victims‚Äô rights stems from both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> and defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX>. The former do not want <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> complicating the trial. They are surely opposed to my proposal that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> be able to veto plea bargains and insist on going to trial to vindicate their charges<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prosecutors</ENAMEX> generally like to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> around at the sentencing phase. The suffering and rage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, when expressed in court, tends to spike the punishment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> are opposed for other reasons. They are afraid that empowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> will distract from the rights of criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendants</ENAMEX>, but this is not necessarily the case.12 The victim‚Äôs interest is primarily in participating in the trial. He or she may communicate a desire for conviction but that parochial sentiment of interest will be readily discounted by the commonsense responses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>. The fact is that it is possible to strengthen the participatory rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> without unduly complicating the procedure or compromising the traditional rights of the defense.


Civil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX>

The central question in any movement of compassion is whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> of reform. There are obviously some areas where we must rely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or on no one. Only the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> could have waged the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> and emancipated the powerless. Only the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> could secure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">franchise</ENAMEX> to those who had no power on the local level. Only the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> can secure equal protection of the laws when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> decide to disfavor some of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. But in other areas of life, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can further its ends by staying its hand.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has sought to maintain the religious sensibility that brought forth the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of Independence</ENAMEX> but was abandoned in the secular <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have become and remained one of the most religious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> on earth, and largely because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has evolved toward a rigorous policy of symbolic support for religion, at the same time insisting that the religious culture either thrive or die on its own. The symbolic gestures include printing <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúIN GOD WE TRUST‚Äù</ENAMEX> on our money, celebrating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> holidays as national holidays, and using the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> in oath-taking ceremonies. These are significant public gestures in a society that rigorously forbids the state‚Äôs spending money to support religious education. Amusingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> even quotes the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Maxim</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Secret Constitution‚</ENAMEX>Äîall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are created equal‚Äîto support the separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX> These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">postures</ENAMEX> seem to be the mirror opposite of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> practices, where the state readily provides subsidies for religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, but would not consider using religious symbols on its money or even using the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> in court to administer the oath to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äútell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.‚Äù Whether these differences in practice are determinative or not, it is clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has remained a more deeply religious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, or even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>. For religious faith to remain strong, it might be better for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to keep its distance.
The same could be said of devotion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> must engage in some elementary gestures of national pride. It must define and disseminate a flag, a national anthem, and celebrate holidays such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans‚Äô Day</ENAMEX>, and the birthdays of great national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nations</ENAMEX> that fail to do these things have trouble melding their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into a single culture of national identity. A good example is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, which has yet to find a holiday that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> can celebrate together. We live in a time of national disintegration‚Äîwitness <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, and the near-misses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada‚Äîand</ENAMEX>, therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is properly advised to cultivate a common identity and a sense of shared history and destiny.
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has hardly lacked a strong sense of national patriotism. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has had to do little to further it. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1890s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pledge of Allegiance</ENAMEX>, our secular prayer to the flag, spontaneously spread across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and became a standard part of the socialization process for all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. There was little national hesitation about our wars of national aggrandizement against militarily weak <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> joined enthusiastically in sending our doughboys overseas, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson‚</ENAMEX>Äôs words, ‚Äúto make the world safe for democracy.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> that fought and won <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> is still with us, infusing in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> a strong sense of a national mission well executed. The war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> was undoubtedly a setback for the spirit of patriotism. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A whole generation‚</TIMEX>Äîmy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and students‚Äîbecame skeptical about the use of military power. Yet, to my surprise and somewhat to my chagrin<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,14</NUMEX> a new cohort took up the sentiments of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> and enthusiastically supported the questionable goals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>. As we were bombing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> erupted again in a spontaneous display of unity and patriotic enthusiasm. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow</ENAMEX> ribbons appeared everywhere. It reminded one of the pledge that burst out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred years earlier</TIMEX>, a paean to the flag in school <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
Civil society is a powerful medium, and when the public takes up the cause either of religion or of patriotism, its strength overshadows the feeble efforts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to manipulate its opinions. Yet, in both fields‚Äîreligion and patriotism‚Äîwe face a constant challenge from those who are unsatisfied with the successes of civil society. They want <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to join the action. Nowhere is this more evident than in the politics of schooling. We worry constantly, perhaps with good reason, that the young in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> are growing up with the wrong values. They supposedly suffer from all the mistakes of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elders</ENAMEX> who promote violence on television and have permitted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to be flooded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, which, as everyone knows, enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> who go on rampages to gain <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">prime time</TIMEX> news coverage. One wonders, however, whether it is an effective response for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to require, as suggested in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> initiative, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> to post the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ten Commandments</ENAMEX> on schoolhouse walls. This drive toward governmental intervention in the field of value formation has been nowhere more evident‚Äîand questionable‚Äîthan the recently revived push for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protestors</ENAMEX> who want to burn it.
The commitment to the flag has surely been one of the stable and recognized provisions of our sub rosa constitution. We do well to cultivate reverence toward the flag, which coupled with national rituals like the pledge, instills sentiments of national loyalty in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Although patriotic sentiments toward the flag antedate the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>, we begin to find, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early twentieth century</TIMEX>, a duty of reverence toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stars and Stripes</ENAMEX> formulated as a legal issue. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1907</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> upheld the conviction for flag desecration of a beer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> who printed the flag on his cans. Appropriating the flag for commercial purposes was considered disrespectful<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.15</NUMEX>
Our attitudes toward the flag were then so obeisant that we adopted religious language to describe acts of disrespect toward <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Glory</ENAMEX>. It would be difficult to say that piece of cloth on which the stars and stripes were printed was ever ‚Äúconsecrated‚Äù so that it could be ‚Äúdesecrated.‚Äù These terms imply the ritual use of an object exclusively for worshiping God. Despite the inappropriate use of religious language, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> upheld this crime as a sensible expression of government‚Äôs instinct to protect the symbols of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.
But then the commitment to national pride ran into a contrary trend in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> thought that had been in the process of emergence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a century</TIMEX>. The impulse to protect the flag against desecration confronted the rising devotion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> American value of free speech. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> and the dissenting opinion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justices</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> and Brandeis<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,16</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> recognition of the primacy of free speech has been on an upward trajectory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, including its most conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX>, has consistently favored the primacy of speech over the interests of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> injured or offended by the rough and ready rumble of the ‚Äúmarketplace of ideas.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù17</ENAMEX>
The collision was inevitable. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> ideas‚Äîprotecting the flag and celebrating freedom of speech‚Äîwould eventually come into focus as contradictory ways of being <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>. It was a close battle, but in two sharply divided votes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decided that freedom of expression must prevail<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.18</NUMEX> But this was hardly a defeat for the politics of national sentiment. Those who loved the flag still had recourse to civil society.19 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of patriotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rituals</ENAMEX>, such as honoring the flag, could learn from the history of religious sensibility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> cannot coerce religious observance without, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Locke</ENAMEX> argued in his first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Letter</ENAMEX> Concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toleration</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1689</TIMEX>), corrupting the act of faith into an empty gesture of external compliance. The opposite effect occurs when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> seeks to punish those who burn the flag. The punitive sanction enhances the communicative sting of flag burning. The simple act of destroying a piece of cloth becomes a major event watched closely by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. The subsequent trial of the flag burner gives him or her a platform for broadcasting the political views expressed in the illegal act. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, burning the flag was something like wearing a jacket in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX> blazoned with the words ‚ÄúFuck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Draft</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚</ENAMEX>Äù20 But when flag burning becomes an acceptable and potentially routine event, it draws no more attention than the use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-letter words at cocktail parties.
There is no doubt that free speech has its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>, and in most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> rush in to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> against being offended. A good example is the way every major jurisdiction outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> treats <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> denial. Someone publishes a book saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auschwitz</ENAMEX> never happened, that it is a lie propagated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>. This is a punishable act in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada‚Äîjust</ENAMEX> about everywhere where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> must intervene in order to protect those who might be disturbed and offended by the obscene lie. By intervening and putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">denier</ENAMEX> on trial, of course, they only broadcast the lie to a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, and they convert the mad dissident into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> in his own circle.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> has remained remarkably unaffected by the academic swing toward support for hate speech legislation. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.A.V.</ENAMEX> case, for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> struck down a municipal ordinance that punished the display of a symbol that one knows or has reason to know ‚Äúarouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù21 Academic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of the decision stress the value of regulating speech that has the effect, it is argued, of silencing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>.22 The overriding value, they claim, is the equality of those affected by hate speech. Only by restricting intimidating speech, the argument goes, can all potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the democratic dialogue feel free to speak and to make their opinions known. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, however, the ancien principles still reign. The primary value is not equality but freedom.
But the government‚Äôs staying its hand does not mean that hate speech goes unsanctioned. Civil society has it own spontaneous means of chastising those who veer too far from the acceptable range of discourse. The best remedy against the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚ÄúAuschwitz</ENAMEX> lie,‚Äù as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> call it, is to ignore it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Lipstadt</ENAMEX>, in her book Denying the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Holocaust</ENAMEX>, wrote that we should not publicly debate unacceptable as well as obviously false claims, and thus she advanced a remedy as powerful as governmental censorship. When civil society turns a deaf ear, crazy ideas lose their edge. The remedy disturbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historian</ENAMEX> labeled a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúdenier‚Äù</ENAMEX> so much that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX> he unsuccessfully sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipstadt</ENAMEX> for libel, primarily to force her to confront his claims<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.23</NUMEX>
In other areas, where racist and sexist speech wounds, the spontaneous order of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society has been uncannily effective in changing patterns of speech. Consider the careful choice of words in this book. I do not write ‚ÄúNegro‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúcolored,‚Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were wont to do not long ago. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúBlack‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúAfrican American‚</ENAMEX>Äù have become the norm, and it all happened without government‚Äôs uttering a sound. When governmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> try to tell people how to talk, they look slightly ridiculous. Witness the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> trying to outlaw the use of the word ‚Äúcheeseburger‚Äù and other insidious harbingers of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> culture. However strong the value of preserving the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> language in all its purity, the task is not one for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. At a certain point we have to trust the unplanned, powerful forces of civil society.


<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Dignity</ENAMEX>

But civil society is not always to be trusted. Witness the drive toward a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against physical desecration. The amendment actually passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1999</TIMEX>, but it is not expected to command the necessary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> vote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. When speech induces a sense of victimization in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and even more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawmakers</ENAMEX> abroad reach for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> of legal remedies to show their compassion for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> basic strategies present themselves. One technique trades heavily on the values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX> and the other, characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> thought, relies heavily on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kantian</ENAMEX> concept of human dignity. The general principle of equal treatment, as we have elaborated it, lends itself to the argument for limiting freedom of speech. The claim is that obscenity degrades <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and, thus, fails to treat them equally with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who are interested in consuming the obscene material. Similarly, hate speech systematically degrades its targets and, therefore, treats them as unworthy of equal status in society. These are good arguments that draw on a long tradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in the theory of equality for protecting the weak and defenseless.
The alternative mode of compassionate jurisprudence relies on the concept of human dignity, elaborated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article 1</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basic Law</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>. The term ‚Äúhuman dignity‚Äù is not defined in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basic Law</ENAMEX> and, therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> must rely on the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kantian</ENAMEX> principles that human dignity expresses the ultimate personhood of each individual. In my view, although we have never expressed a principle of human dignity in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> constitutional law, the same principle underlies our commitment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Great Maxim</ENAMEX>. Our notion of equality-in-creation derives from the view that we are all of ultimate value, an idea that can be expressed either by going back to the biblical idea of creation in the image of God or taking the secular alternative of human dignity beyond all price, as articulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kant‚</ENAMEX>Äôs moral theory<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.24</NUMEX>
To see how the notion of human dignity operates in practice, let us take a look at the well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peep Show</ENAMEX> case decided in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Administrative Court</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bundesverwaltungsgericht</ENAMEX>] in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.25</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> of a peep show were denied a business permit because their show supposedly violated the morals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. Their show displayed a naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> on a circulating round stage, viewed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booths</ENAMEX> equipped with one-way windows. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> could not see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who were gawking at their genitalia and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> could not see each other. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Administrative Court</ENAMEX> upheld the denial of the license on the ground that the show violated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhuman dignity‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who chose to participate. That participation was voluntary was irrelevant, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> had an absolute duty under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article 1</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúprotect human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dignity‚</ENAMEX>Äù whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> wanted the help or not.
The court‚Äôs rationale for the decision traded heavily on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kantian</ENAMEX> principle that no one should ever use another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> exclusively as a means to an end<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> had no objection to strip-tease performances, which they regarded as a variation on dancing in front of an interactive public. But the one-way nature of the viewing in this case disturbed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>:
By contrast with a strip tease, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the peep show are subjected to a humiliating objectifying role, brought about by a number of factors: the automatic way in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewers</ENAMEX> pay for the opening of the ‚Äúpeep‚Äù window, in which the viewing of the naked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> resembles buying a product from a vending machine, the one-way windows that leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, without eye contact, as the isolated objects of salacious desire and the voyeurs relegated to their secret cabins<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.27</NUMEX>

One has to think twice before rejecting this argument. This is not simple prudery. The fact is that the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX> does degrade the participating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> into mere objects, and though one could imagine a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> enjoying doing a strip-tease to an appreciative bunch of unruly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>, the anonymity of private sexual gratification could leave one with a sense of humanity abandoned. Yet, there is obviously another point of view. The self-exposure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> on the rotating stage is not that much different from doing a strip-tease before a television camera. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> is invisible; each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viewer</ENAMEX> is in his little cubicle, called a living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. The danger in the argument of human dignity is that it carries the risk of dogmatism. In the face of the conviction that the peep show violates the dignity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who choose to participate, there is little one can say.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> feminist favors the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> approach of treating the problem in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peep Show</ENAMEX> case as one of equality rather than human dignity<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.28</NUMEX> The participation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> may seem voluntary on the surface. But the mandate of equal justice for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> requires that we inquire whether in light of the existing power structure, the participation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> is really voluntary. Appearances deceive. The argument of dignity begins and ends with the question whether the work reduces <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to the status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. The perspective of equality, by contrast, encourages a broader political inquiry into the relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">arenas</ENAMEX> of sex and money. The feminist assumption, apparently, is that in a state of true equality, no one would agree to engage in this kind of self-humiliation for pay. To be sure, however, that the work is so degrading, we must make implicit judgments about the kinds of activities that allow our sense of humanity to flourish. We are invariably drawn back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kantian</ENAMEX> theory of human dignity.
Whether we approach the problem of sexual exploitation as a problem of dignity or of equality, we can see the politics of compassion at work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX> as a whole undertakes to protect the self-worth of those who fall prey to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superior forces</ENAMEX>. We have made the transition from governmental intervention to prevent slavery to a collective responsibility for the welfare of each. Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> would not interfere with the appearance of autonomy in the peep show. But we took aggressive measures during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Prohibition</ENAMEX> to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> against the self-degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>, and we intervene <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in a mammoth and seemingly unproductive campaign to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> against drug abuse.
The paradox of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> approach toward equality is that though we trail <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> in our concern about economic equality and wealth discrimination, we lead the world in other areas of egalitarian thinking. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX> has emerged, with vigor, in our collective effort to curtail sexual harassment and discrimination against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the work place. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> has occurred at the level of federal law, particularly in the interpretation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act</ENAMEX>.29 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> often forgets that the expansion of sexual harassment law is grounded in the simple commitment to overcome gender inequality in the workplace. The law has moved so quickly in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> no longer know when and how they can approach a coworker and make a compliment or request a date. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> even paid a ransom of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$850,000</NUMEX> to avoid an appeal in a sexual harassment dispute in which the law and the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> judgment seemed clearly on his side<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.30</NUMEX> Whatever the merits of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of law, there is little doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> stand responsible for exporting this vision of sexual equality on the job and even for the creation of a new vocabulary of sexuelle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bel√§stigung</ENAMEX> and harc√®lement sexuel necessary to discuss the problem.
The redress of sexual harassment should be understood, in part, as an expression of the egalitarian aspirations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Constitution</ENAMEX>. Yet, as a symptom of the times, sexual harassment also represents a new vision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>; it has developed against the background of growing skepticism about whether things really are what they seem.
Equality for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Believers</ENAMEX> 
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nonbelievers</ENAMEX>

The values of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> constitution continue to collide with those of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. The egalitarian approach toward freedom of religion dictates a leveling of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conflicting clauses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> on freedom of religion. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> clause prescribes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúestablishment of religion‚Äù; the other mandates ‚Äúthe free exercise of religion.‚Äù For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past thirty years or so</TIMEX>, the tendency has been to read these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clauses together to prohibit both the state financing of religious activities and the state‚Äôs favoring one religion by granting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> special exemptions from the laws applicable to everyone.31 The opposition claims that religious reasons warrant exceptional treatment, say, for refusing to work on one‚Äôs personal <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Sabbath,32</NUMEX> for using hallucinatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,33</NUMEX> or for keeping one‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> out of school in violation of truancy laws<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX> Again the conflict is between equality and freedom. Equality requires that all be treated alike‚Äîno exceptions for those motivated by fear of God. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> object and insist on the teaching found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">22:21: ‚</TIMEX>ÄúRender therefore, unto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caesar</ENAMEX> the things which are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caesar‚Äôs</ENAMEX>; and unto God, the things that are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God‚Äôs.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚</ENAMEX>Äù35 The constitutional right to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfreedom of religion,‚Äù they argue, requires special exemptions for those who dissent, as a matter of conscience, from the laws applicable to others.
While the judicial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of freedom continue to hold the upper hand on free speech, the reigning approach to freedom of religion underscores the even-handedness of the law‚Äîthe same rules should apply to religious and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonreligious</ENAMEX> alike. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> v. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>, the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> held that this egalitarian approach to religion should govern the cases of some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native Americans</ENAMEX> who claimed the right to use peyote in their religious services. Their good-faith claim for exceptional treatment did not prevail in the face of the general prohibition against peyote as a drug perceived to be dangerous<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.36</NUMEX> In order to reach this conclusion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> had to push aside a line of precedents recognizing a policy of deference to any who refused, as a matter of religious conscience, to comply with the laws of the state<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> responded to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Smith‚Äôs egalitarian</ENAMEX> treatment of religion by enacting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1993.38</NUMEX> The purpose was to restore the earlier jurisprudence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúto provide a claim or defense to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚</ENAMEX>Äù39 The supposed ground for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress‚</ENAMEX>Äôs overruling a constitutional decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>.40 The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of the statute thus relied upon a provision of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> constitution to defend a conception of freedom rooted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX> and the first <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>. When the case reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justices</ENAMEX> found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had exceeded its authority under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>.41 The spirit of the decision dovetails well with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court‚Äôs</ENAMEX> decision in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1883</TIMEX> to overturn the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> civil rights acts as an excessive claim of congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>.
The decision reflects a general tendency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to suppress the independent significance of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> constitution. If the postbellum constitutional order were taken seriously, as an independent source of constitutional law, its legislative provisions would be construed as liberally as the grants of legislative authority under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äúinterstate commerce‚Äù</ENAMEX> clause and the other provisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article I</ENAMEX> defining the power of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>. Yet, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court‚</ENAMEX>Äôs attitude toward legislative authority under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourteenth Amendment</ENAMEX> begins on the assumption of fear. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> should be able to implement the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdue process‚Äù</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúequal protection‚Äù clauses but not engage in imaginative interpretations of what these clauses should mean in practice. In defense of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, however, we should note the extraordinary claim that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> should have the authority‚Äîwherever it might be located‚Äîexplicitly to overrule a constitutional decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. Recognizing congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> for this purpose would destabilize the structure of judicial review, as it has evolved since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early nineteenth century</TIMEX>, and therefore the conservative inclination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> has much to commend it.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> cannot but be impressed by the ‚Äúpostmodern‚Äù style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court‚</ENAMEX>Äôs resolution of this constitutional crisis about freedom of religion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> relies on egalitarian thinking‚Äîa value drawn from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> constitution‚Äîto develop an approach to the conflicting clauses on religion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">First Amendment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> seeks to return to an interpretation of religious liberty attributed to the first <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>, but grounds its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>, the cornerstone of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> constitution. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> parries in the name of equality by cabining and curtailing the legislative authority that could be used to further the egalitarian values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fourteenth Amendment</ENAMEX>.
