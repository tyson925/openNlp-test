<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, home economics courses in high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> taught cooking, nutrition, and sewing to most schoolgirls. The sewing machine, in its polished wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>, was an expensive and valued wedding gift. Now the sewing machine, like the typewriter, is fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">disappearing</ENAMEX>. The typewriter is being replaced by the computer, and the home sewing machine has become a small, inexpensive portable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> stored in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> and used for minor repairs and alterations—if it is used at all. There are many reasons for this shift away from home sewing, including the growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. But perhaps the main reason is that production of factory-sewn clothing has become increasingly cost effective. It has taken away a time-consuming and often wearying task from the round of daily chores, providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> with a wide array of products and styles at reasonable prices. The popularity of casual-wear items like T-shirts and jeans—quintessentially factory-sewn garments—has also shifted sewing from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>.
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> number of units of outerwear created in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has remained remarkably constant over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several decades</TIMEX>, varying from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> per capita in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1995,1</NUMEX> while the number of production <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> has continued to drop, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,098,200</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">664,400</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1997.2</NUMEX> This employment decrease is associated with the impact of casual wear, an increase in worker productivity, and the significant import penetration in garments with high labor content. Casual clothing is not only less expensive to purchase and maintain but also requires less labor to assemble.
Whether the apparel item is casual or formal, the stitching in the garment must accomplish one or more of the following objectives. The primary reason to sew, of course, is to join individual pattern pieces. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> objective is to leave no raw edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX> to unravel. This feature is sometimes combined with the joining operation, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“felled seaming”</ENAMEX> on the inseam of jeans or the sleeve seam in men’s dress shirts. The felled seam was first used in work clothing because of its strength and has since migrated to other apparel items because of its visible stitch pattern. Decorative stitching is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> objective of sewing. In the felled seams of shirts and jeans, for example, the visible stitches might be of a color designed to decorate the garment<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.3</NUMEX> No matter which stitch pattern is being used or which seaming operation carried out, the sewing machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must guide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> pieces of cloth together through the machine. That is the basis of modern sewing operations in manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>.
As we have noted throughout, the actual sewing of a garment may take place far away from its design: the translation of that design into a pattern, and the making of a marker of that pattern, which is arranged on layers of fabric for cutting. Consequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of that garment often involves sewing together pieces from prearranged bundles sent by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. In the contemporary world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subcontractors</ENAMEX>, and complicated sourcing decisions, assembly is usually the step in the manufacturing process that is farmed out to lower-cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>.
Yet just because many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> rely on foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractors</ENAMEX> for a good portion of garment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, it does not mean sewing in a factory requires little or no skill. Only a very few sewing operations involve a machine that is fully automated, in which the operator’s job comes down to stacking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parts</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end of the sewing system and re-threading the machines if a thread breaks. Today’s factory sewing machine is generally dedicated to a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> and most likely will be fitted with specialized fixtures in the area of the stitch plate—to help guide the seaming a fixed distance from the fabric edge, for example, or fold the edge of the cloth under, or with other attachments that feed elastic tape and so on into the seaming operation as needed. More complicated sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> to guide differential stitching, with more fabric in each top stitch than in the bottom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Regardless of which individual sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are required, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must be trained and given practice time to achieve a quality product, at least at the standard production rates.
The time required for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> to achieve production standards, while maintaining quality, can range from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> for the simplest operation to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a year</TIMEX> for joining the sleeve to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of a suit coat. A few sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are so demanding that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> are never able to achieve the minimum acceptable production rate for them. With different skill levels required for different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, it is not surprising that piece rates vary with the difficulty of the operation. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, we will describe what actually goes on in today’s sewing room—the machines used, what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> do, the flow of operations—and how sourcing decisions for replenishable products may affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly operations</ENAMEX> in the future<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sewing Machines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garment Assembly</ENAMEX>
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major types of sewing machines used in garment assembly: the lockstitch and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-stitch machine. Each type feeds in separate threads above and below the fabric, and these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> threads must be connected in some fashion to form a stitch. Both have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> top thread for each needle above the seam and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> different threads on the bottom below the surface of the sewing table. The primary difference between these sewing machines is in the way the two threads interact.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockstitch Machine</ENAMEX>
Almost all home machines are lockstitch machines. The top thread comes from a spool or cone of thread above the machine and goes through many thread guides, a thread tensioner, a take-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, and, finally, the needle. The bottom thread is wound on a bobbin, a small spool, that is below the needle and the sewing surface. To make a stitch, the needle with the top thread is plunged through the plies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX>, and a loop of the top thread is formed below the surface of the stitch plate (often called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">“throat plate”</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> The loop of top thread is passed over the bobbin and around its thread. The take-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> then pulls up the top thread to set a stitch. The top and bottom threads are locked together by passing the loop of the top thread around the bobbin.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> part of the art of sewing comes in adjusting the thread tension<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX> With a lockstitch machine, when the needle withdraws from the cloth and the take-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> pulls the top thread tight, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stitch</ENAMEX> begins to be “locked” or set in place. If the tension on the top and bottom thread is too high, the seam puckers and the seam length becomes less than that of the cloth. If the tension is too low, the seam will be so loose one can see through it when holding up the joined pattern pieces. Indeed, a well-formed lockstitch is smooth and appears the same when viewed from either the top or bottom ply. Note that even if a sewing machine is properly adjusted for sewing a particular weight and color of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX>, it will generally need to be adjusted again if the fabric color changes because the mechanical properties of a given type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX> can depend on the dye color used. The lighter the fabric weight, the more sensitive seam quality is to machine adjustments and thread tensions as well as to the ability of sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> to make necessary adjustments.
In a factory setting, lockstitch machines are used for the decorative stitching that is necessary whenever the undersurface of a garment piece will be seen during normal wear, such as in the collar and cuffs of a dress shirt. The primary disadvantage of this kind of machine is that the bobbin must be small enough so that it can pass through the top thread loop, but it then quickly empties of thread. When this happens, sewing must be stopped and a newly loaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bobbin</ENAMEX> inserted to replace the empty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Since the bobbin is reached by sliding back the stitch plate, if a bobbin runs out in the middle of an operation, it might be necessary to rip the seam out from the beginning and start over. Therefore, sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> generally keep track of the number of items sewn on a bobbin and stop before the thread runs out. If it were not for the limited thread capacity of the bobbin and the need for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> to wind thread onto the bobbin, the lockstitch would be more widely used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
While men’s dress shirts are normally sewn with white thread, regardless of the fabric color, most apparel items use a thread color to match or contrast in a decorative way with the cloth. This means that after sewing a bundle of items of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> color, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must not only change the needle thread but also put in a new bobbin for each new color of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX>. If an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> has a choice of thread color for the next lot to be sewn, she will always choose the color of the last bundle. Changing the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX>, even if the thread color is the same, generally demands adjustment of the thread tensions and other parts of the machine. Long production runs of the same basic item of apparel, with the same fabric, allow sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> to make major machine settings once a day, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a few</NUMEX> additional adjustments required throughout the shift.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chain-Stitch Machine</ENAMEX>
This machine overcomes the bobbin thread limitation and can operate at higher speeds, but it does have disadvantages. In this case, there is no bobbin. Below the sewing surface, the lower thread is manipulated by a mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> called a looper. The looper inserts a loop of the bottom thread into a loop of the top thread that is created when the needle pierces through the fabric plies and begins to withdraw from the cloth. The top thread is then pulled up by the take-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. The top thread cannot be pulled through the cloth because it is held below the fabric by the inserted loop of the bottom thread. The bottom thread is formed into a continuous sequence of very small loops by the looper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>. Although the top and bottom threads are not interlocked, as in the lockstitch machine, the stitch is fixed in place and the seam has a bit more flexibility.
Because the bottom thread does not have to be encircled by the top thread, the bottom thread can come from a large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cone</ENAMEX> stored above the machine. A new cone of looper thread contains <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of thread and generally does not have to be replaced more frequently than a few times during a shift. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> can glance up at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX> of both top and bottom threads and replace them before they run out in the middle of a seam. The disadvantage of this kind of machine is that it makes seams that are not as secure as the lockstitch; in addition, the appearance of the seam from the top and bottom of the fabric is different. If a stitch is skipped—the looper thread is not inserted or may not get caught in the loop of the top thread—then the resulting thread loop could pull the seam out if it were to catch on something. Factory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> look for such flaws, but they are hard to find because they end up on the inside of a garment.
Nevertheless, the advantages of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-stitch machine far outweigh its disadvantages. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-stitch seam is strong and can be produced more quickly than a lockstitch seam. Most of the long seams in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>-sewn apparel are made with a chain-stitch machine or with variations of it. The felled seam commonly used for the inseam of jeans comes from a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-needle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-stitch machine. Such stitching generally outlasts the fabric of jeans, as one can see from looking at the holey knees of jeans worn by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX>.
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sewing Machines</ENAMEX>
A wide variety of specialized sewing machines are also used in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>. There are machines with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple needles</ENAMEX> and loopers that attach elastic waistbands to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boxer</ENAMEX> shorts, for example. Knit fleece goods are commonly joined by a seaming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> called over-edging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> (and overlocking sewing in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> use). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-edge or overlocking machine automatically aligns the fabric by trimming off the edges of the plies to be joined just before the stitch is made. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> thread wraps around the edge of the fabric during the stitching process. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-thread overlocking or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-edging machines, each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> designed to meet a given requirement of seam, strength, flexibility, and security. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over</NUMEX>-edge machines can run at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 8,000</NUMEX> stitches a minute. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> stitches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX>, it is possible to seam thirteen to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more inches</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, however, a sewing machine’s maximum speed is generally not what limits production; it is the time it takes to set up the work on the machine and guide the fabric to the needle as the seam is being made.
What the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sewing Operator Does</ENAMEX>
In a typical apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, a sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> is actually sewing only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-quarter</NUMEX> of the time. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must first select the work to be done, put aside the tickets that indicate she performed the sewing appropriate for those bundles and should be paid at the specified rate for the job, open the appropriate bundles, and position the pieces to be joined on the sewing table in preparation for sewing<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.7</NUMEX>
If the sewing machine is correctly threaded, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> then lifts the presser foot—a device that comes down on either side of the needle to hold the cloth—and, if the needle is in the up position, inserts the fabric. Otherwise, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> turns the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> wheel to get the needle in the up position, lowers the presser foot, sews <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the seam</TIMEX>, backstitches to lock the seam, grabs the two plies of cloth near where the seam will end, and guides the cloth through the sewing machine. Usually, she will backstitch at the seam end, then cut the thread. Some machines have an automatic thread-trimmer to do this step; if not, then the threads must be cut and the finished work put in an appropriate pile to be tied together when all the pieces of the bundle have been finished<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>
Machine-tending, material placement, and off-loading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are all considered part of a sewing operator’s job. Although none of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> actually involves sewing, they do take time to complete and are taken into account when determining the piece rate and normal workload for an operation. If a new sewing table or a new sewing machine with programmable features is added at a particular workstation—that is, any device that reduces the time it takes to complete various tasks—then the allowable time and wage rate for that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> must be changed.
These issues aside, there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other major task a sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> performs. She must make the pieces of the pattern fit together at the end of the sewing process. This is certainly not possible if there has been a big mistake in cutting, but it is never easy, even without serious cutting errors. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plies of flat cloth of identical length are placed on top of each other and sewn together, then the ends of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces will not line up without the intervention of a sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ends of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a thirty-inch</NUMEX> leg seam on a pair of jeans, for instance, might be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter of an inch</NUMEX> out of alignment unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> takes control. During sewing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> on the machine—a part that comes up through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> slots in the stitch plate and engages the bottom ply of cloth—will pull the bottom ply under the presser foot and against the pull of the thread. The top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ply</ENAMEX> of cloth is carried along by the bottom ply; hence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ply is stretched more than the other.
This simple fact of sewing makes it very difficult to automate the process. In reality, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seam lines to be joined are rarely exactly the same length. Cutting introduces differences from the top to the bottom of the layers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fabric</ENAMEX>. No matter how good spreaders and cutters are, preassembly operations are never perfect. The sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> must overcome all these prior minor variations, as well as the differences introduced by the sewing process, and make the joining seam come out even at the end. She accomplishes this magic by stretching the two plies differently. First, the plies are stretched to get the pattern notches in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to align; then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> are pulled together, causing them to align. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> uses the elasticity of the cloth to overcome minor errors in cutting and prior sewing. Indeed, most trained sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> see this defect correction simply as part of their job.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sewing Room</ENAMEX>
The vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in the apparel industry are involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. This is illustrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 9.1</ENAMEX> (page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX>) for the men’s and boys’ shirt industry. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 percent</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in this industry were classified as working in the sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 percent</NUMEX> were sewing machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>. Given the predominant share of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of work in the sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> has been the central focus of management attention.
The sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of most apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> are similar in overall appearance. Apparel parts, trim pieces, buttons, zippers, and thread arrive at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and are separated for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, or subassembly. As the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> noted, large apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> usually operate a central cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> that provides cut parts to an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sewing plants<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9 About two-thirds</NUMEX> of the production volume of our surveyed business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> did their marker-making, spreading, and cutting in a single location. Most would deliver cut goods to sewing plants many times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>; however, when cutting is done <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of miles</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sewing plants</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> deliveries are the norm. Trucks take fresh parts to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and return with finished goods for the distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
Sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are generally arranged in rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, each seated at a machine doing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> on a bundle of parts. Traditionally, the progressive bundle system assumed that maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> productivity could be achieved by breaking down the steps of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> into a series of discrete operations. Each sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> would be trained in the correct approach to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specific task. Through repetition of the task and coaching by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> would become very productive. Although new work practices are evolving in the apparel industry, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> still specialize in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> or at most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. In fact, long product runs in men’s and unisex product lines, such as jeans, have made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> extremely efficient.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are paid on a piece-rate basis—that is, they are paid a fixed amount for each seam sewn correctly. If a part must be reworked, it is done on the operator’s own time. This incentive system means that each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> needs to have work-in-process waiting; if there is a machine breakdown or no work waiting, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> will be paid at some average earnings rate during the waiting period. But to avoid this, there is always work waiting; for example, in a men’s dress-shirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> there can be a day’s worth at each sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. On the sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> floor, there are generally piles of items ready to be sewn or moved to the next assembly step. The time it takes for a given item of apparel to pass through a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is determined by the average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of work-in-process before each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> and the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> along the critical path.
Work Flow in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plant</ENAMEX>
The flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> through a typical men’s dress-shirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewing factory</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.1</NUMEX> (page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX>). The subassemblies for the collars, backs, fronts, cuffs, and sleeves might be on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of a center aisle down the factory floor and the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> steps on the other side. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> needs to keep track of the flow of items through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> to assure that the subassemblies, such as the sleeves, are ready to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX>. A given shirt must have a specified collar size and a given sleeve length. Clearly, the fabric, color, and style must also match. If the cut bundles are sent to the factory once a week, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> might then put that week’s bundles into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> identified by a flag flying the color for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that week</TIMEX>. Note that the work in a shirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is generally grouped into production lots of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> shirts if the progressive bundle system is used. Shirts are normally counted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the dozen</NUMEX>, so a production lot comes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125 dozen</NUMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each day</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> looks over the factory floor to see if any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>. Finding the correct parts for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX> can often involve a hunt through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. For example, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> when it goes back to be loaded again. Because a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> may have a day’s work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKUs</ENAMEX>. Partially finished shirts and shirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subassemblies</ENAMEX> will then be in a number of places in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>.
This shirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> employs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX> in question is rated to require twelve <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> to assemble, such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in the figure, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">forty-hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">work week</TIMEX> will produce <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,167 dozen</NUMEX> shirts when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> is operating at standard efficiency. (Of course, many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> may fall below the standard and take longer than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twelve minutes</TIMEX> to make that shirt.)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> A typical time for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX> to go through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX>, which means the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> will have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,667 dozen</NUMEX> shirts as work-in-process (WIP). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forty operations</ENAMEX> indicated in the figure may require <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only twelve minutes</TIMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> are working at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent</NUMEX> efficiency, but any given shirt still takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty working days</TIMEX> to pass through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. To shorten the time significantly, the work-in-process in front of each of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> listed as part of the critical path would have to be reduced from a day to just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX>. Not all the forty different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are sequential; the parts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> goes on in parallel, but the final assembly involves a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> that require all the subassemblies to be completed and ready to be mated with the correct parts.
Needless to say, reduction of throughput time is not a simple task. Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forty operations</ENAMEX> require very little time; others are much longer. Hemming the top of a shirt pocket is a short operation, for example, but it takes longer to attach the pocket and longer still if stripes must be matched. If there is one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> for the short operation, then there will have to be several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> for the longer one just to keep the production line in balance. If any one of the several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> speeds up or slows down, the line becomes unbalanced. If the imbalance lasts for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than an hour</TIMEX> or so, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> would have to take corrective action. A utility <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> skilled in several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> might be brought over from another area to move work past the slow sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Clearly, it is easier for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> to keep all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> supplied with work, especially since in most cases the work-in-process for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> is large. The large buffers are designed so that natural <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> variations in work rhythm do not cause a major disruption. In fact, a production line is probably never in perfect balance. If it were, when even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> changed her pace, the line would drift out of balance.
As work progresses through a typical sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, it is also common for a special order to disrupt the flow. Even if the special order does not require a thread change, as with most dress shirts, someone will have to move the order to the front of the queue at each sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and combine the parts for final assembly.
We have visited a top-of-the-line men’s suit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> where a special order would go through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four working days</TIMEX>, rather than the normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>, just by allowing the work to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the work buffer at each sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. In this suit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, work was moved from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> to the next by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unit Production System</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> is a mechanical overhead transport system that moves a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of clothing from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> work station to the next. The mechanical device generally carries all parts of the finished garment. After a sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> finishes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> is sent on its way to the next. There is a finite mechanical buffer area before each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>; when the buffer fills, the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> is automatically sent to another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> who does the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>.
With a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> delivery system, factory throughput time can be dramatically reduced. But the cost required to install such a system is steep, running to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> or more per workstation. The high cost and lack of production-floor flexibility after the mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conveyers</ENAMEX> are installed have limited the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> adopting these systems. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 3.5 percent</NUMEX> of the output of our surveyed business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> was assembled using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX>. A competing approach to reducing plant throughput time involves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>-based sewing or modular production, which we will discuss at length in the next chapter. In that case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> are trained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Workers</ENAMEX> move from one sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> to another, guiding the work-in-process through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>.
The assembly of most items of apparel follows the work flow sketched here. Subassemblies are manufactured in small lines and join the critical path at the appropriate point. But while a T-shirt, for example, might include sleeves made in the cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, its collar might be inserted, the sleeves attached, and the garment finished in a sewing room far removed from the cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. A suit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> might cut the cloth for the suit in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, ship the coat parts to another, and ship the pants parts to yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Eventually, regardless of where particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are carried out, the finished garments return to a central distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> to be shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. In the case of the suit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in different locations, each individual suit is made from shell fabric cut from the same roll and generally the same ply of cloth on the lay table. Matching the coats, pants, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vests</ENAMEX> is carried out in a special section of the distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The items are then stored in a way that makes them easy to pick for an order about to be shipped.
The Costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX>
The investment per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> in a sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is quite modest. A simple new commercial sewing machine may cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000 to $3,000</NUMEX>, but a rebuilt machine can run <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as low as five hundred dollars</NUMEX> and still provide a good dozen years of production. The average annual capital investment in sewing machines and attachments per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> in our survey was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$720</NUMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> dollars). Some of the machines in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> men’s dress-shirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> previously described will cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20,000</NUMEX> or more, but such automated sewing systems are rare. As we have already noted, the general requirement for return on investment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> expensive capital equipment to be operated under more than single-shift conditions, unless it is essential to produce a given item. The automated sewing systems that create the closely spaced regular stitch patterns used as decorative top stitching on men’s dress shirts, collars, cuffs, and pockets are examples of expensive machines operated for a single shift.
Because assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are driven more by labor costs than capital-intensive equipment, a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewing factory</ENAMEX> operates just a single shift a day, with an average of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about thirty-seven hours</TIMEX> of work per week<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX> On the men’s side of the industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are common, but smaller loft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are typical for women’s apparel. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Factories</ENAMEX> are located where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> lives. And the infrastructure needed to support a sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is relatively modest. Power in the form of electricity, water—especially if items like jeans are to be washed—and a phone are about all that is required. In some developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, which are generally located at the outer reaches of the local industrial infrastructure. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> often live in dormitories on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory compound</ENAMEX> for a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> before returning to their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> or moving into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Similar worker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dormitory</ENAMEX> arrangements were part of the men’s suit industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as recently as fifteen years ago</TIMEX>.
Apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demands of Rapid Replenishment</ENAMEX>
The traditional system of apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> was designed to minimize the direct labor costs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>, not production throughput time. The progressive bundle system, with up to a day’s WIP waiting for each sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> was an efficient way of operating when the costs of carrying mountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WIP</ENAMEX> did not enter into production costs. Generally, under this system of apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> all production was made to fill an actual order. The risk of inventory was carried by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> who placed the order, so apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> carried large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WIP</ENAMEX> (in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> for our sample an average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.65 weeks</TIMEX> worth).
But under rapid replenishment arrangements, the inventory risk is now assumed by the apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>; consequently assembly time is now very important. As shown in the cases studied in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 7</ENAMEX>, production-cycle time and inventory carrying costs are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crucial parameters in making rapid replenishment sourcing decisions. When the assembly cycle time is reduced, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WIP</ENAMEX> and finished goods inventory levels necessary to meet a given rapid replenishment demand go down.
The possibility of mass customization for some apparel items presents another market opportunity that demands short-cycle production. If a retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> pays a premium for a custom pair of jeans, dress <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shirt</ENAMEX>, or suit, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> will expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX> to be delivered to her home within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. We are a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of last-minute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>, and mass customization will have to compete against overnight delivery of apparel items with less than perfect fit from a specialty catalog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. Speed of delivery has increasingly become part of the competitive equation.
There are a number of ways to organize apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> to minimize cycle time. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way is to use a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> assembly process. Another involves reorganizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> themselves through a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> responsible for the entire critical path of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. In this case, sewing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> achieve production-line balance by moving from one workstation to another advancing the work smoothly through the line. As in life, there are few if any absolutes in methods of apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Each method of organizing production has advantages and problems associated with it. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 10</ENAMEX> takes up these issues in detail.
