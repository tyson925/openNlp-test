In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wanamaker</ENAMEX> opened his flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve-story</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, with its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty-five acres</NUMEX> of floor space, was the largest of its time devoted to retail merchandising. Its central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚ÄúGrand Court‚Äù</ENAMEX> had marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arches</ENAMEX> that rose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> feet and was capped by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>. Major physical innovations were hidden behind this visual wonder: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> state-of-the-art <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>; the latest in fireproofing; a large power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> devoted entirely to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>; and sophisticated heating, ventilating, and sanitation systems.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanamaker</ENAMEX> had been in the forefront of retailing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than thirty years</TIMEX> by the time he opened this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>. His goal was to provide the elegant shopping experience of major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> while satisfying the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> desire for product diversity. At the same time, he based his retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fundamental principles: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> price for a product (no haggling); prices guaranteed to be ‚<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Äú10 percent</NUMEX> lower than the lowest elsewhere‚Äù; acceptance of cash payments only, in order to keep prices low; and cash refunds or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> for unsatisfied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. With these fundamental principles in hand, he became one of the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his day</TIMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wanamaker‚Äôs Philadelphia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> synthesized a set of existing technologies and, along with a number of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>, began another revolution in the industry. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Walton</ENAMEX> started small in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> rapidly became the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, with total sales in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1995</TIMEX> equaling the combined sales volumes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kmart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears Roebuck and Co.</ENAMEX>, and the supermarket chain The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroger Co.</ENAMEX>, the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Walton‚Äôs successful innovations placed enormous pressure on other mass merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> to alter their practices along similar lines. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>, a growing number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> had started changing the way they did business.
As we have emphasized, the current retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">revolution‚</ENAMEX>Äîinvolving new information technologies, new product labeling, and new methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">distribution‚Äîhas</ENAMEX> driven changes in the apparel and textile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX> as well. Yet this revolution didn‚Äôt happen <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>; nor was it the brainchild of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX>. In fact, the retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanamaker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walton</ENAMEX> integrated a variety of innovations that had already been pioneered by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Wanamaker‚Äôs ‚Äúone</ENAMEX>-price‚Äù policy was initially adopted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesaler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Tappan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1820s</TIMEX> and experimented with by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord & Taylor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1838</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowland Macy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1850s</TIMEX>. Similarly, bar codes and electronic scanning‚Äîkey building blocks of new retailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practices‚</ENAMEX>Äîbegan in the grocery industry. Kmart became the first major nonfood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> to employ them as a means of tracking inventory in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walton</ENAMEX> made this technology a core building block of his distribution system.
This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> will examine the differences between the traditional re-tail <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and lean retailing. We explore how the set of practices that traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> drew on to merchandise and distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> became increasingly costly. Then we return to why retailers‚Äî-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kmart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. C. Penney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard‚Äôs Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores</ENAMEX>, and others‚Äîadapted technologies and management practices to handle demand uncertainty, product proliferation, and complex sourcing decisions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retail Challenge</ENAMEX>
Imagine the problems faced by a typical department store. It must cater to a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, with varied tastes, disparate income levels, and a wide range of physical measurements. It must deal with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> changes that affect the type of clothes offered‚Äîis it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>? The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beginning of the school year</TIMEX>? The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday season</TIMEX>? If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> operates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in different geographic regions, its product offerings must also reflect regional differences in style, weather, income, and culture. In addition to these factors, consumer tastes often shift rapidly, sometimes within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single season</TIMEX>. These long-standing causes of variation in consumer demand have been further compounded by accelerating product proliferation in all segments of the apparel industry.
The combination of different sizes, colors, styles, fabrics, price lines, and consumer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> means that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> must carry an enormous range of different products. The more diverse the consumer base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX>, the larger the number of individual products typically measured in stockkeeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (SKUs)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> This variety is portrayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3.1</ENAMEX>, which shows the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKUs</ENAMEX> provided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> by different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> over the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKUs</ENAMEX> can range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just 10,000</NUMEX> for a discount food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Costco</ENAMEX>, which offers a limited number of products sold in large quantities, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two million</NUMEX> different items in an upscale department store.
Today <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> must manage this profusion of products. At an operational level, this means deciding what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and how many of any one good it should stock to maximize sales per square foot of available space‚Äîone of the most critical measures of retail performance. If all goes well, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> allocate space to different goods efficiently, responding to shifts in consumer tastes (stocking the hits and discontinuing flops); setting pricing policies (markups and markdowns) to deal with both the direct cost of goods and the nature of consumer demand; and controlling inventory to reduce exposure to risk. Further, the contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> has to keep track of sales and inventory accurately by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKU</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elements of Traditional Retailing</ENAMEX>
The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early twentieth-century</TIMEX> success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanamaker‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and other department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> illustrates that the keys to effective retailing are providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> with a variety of desirable products, procuring those products at a low enough cost to make a profit, marketing them well, and charging prices that reflect customers‚Äô willingness to pay. As we discussed in the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> were able to implement this strategy in the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX> because the falling distribution costs afforded by a national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway system</ENAMEX>, as well as new information links arising from the telegraph and later the telephone, provided economies of scale and scope. Other technological innovations, including steel construction, plate glass, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otis</ENAMEX> elevator, allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> to expand multi-story floor space without purchasing more real estate, providing for a more varied collection of products. The creation of a national highway system in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> further fostered the development of mass retailing by opening vast new spaces in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>.
Under the traditional model, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> ordered desired products far in advance of the selling season because their apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> charged less for large runs and long lead times with long periods of advance commitment. Retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX>, assigned to a specific product line, purchased products based on their best guesses of what would sell. They would then apply rules of thumb to allocate volume across styles and sizes. These transactions typically occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight to ten months</TIMEX> before the goods appeared on the retailer‚Äôs selling floor. The success of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> therefore turned on their ability to predict what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> would want and to obtain those products at the lowest possible cost<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.3</NUMEX> Although the order would specify a delivery time far closer to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> placed the order with the apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>, it typically remained unchanged until delivery to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">retailer‚Äôs warehouse</ENAMEX> or individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.
As portrayed in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX>, the typical shipment between an apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> and retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> was large and of low frequency‚Äîusually once a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>. Once delivered, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> held the products in central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> or as inventory in individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stores‚Äô ‚Äúback rooms</ENAMEX>.‚Äù When the desired time of display and sale arrived, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> stocked the product on the selling floor and replenished from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> or warehouse inventories as the selling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> progressed. Inventory control relied on painstaking, manual comparisons between sales records (paper receipts) and physical counts of items on the floor, in the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overstocks</ENAMEX> at the close of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a season</TIMEX> were then marked down for clearance, warehoused in inventory for future sales, or sold to a secondary market supplying discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>.
Those who could predict, or in some cases create, markets for new products clearly were at an advantage. Not surprisingly, fast tracks in the traditional retail world started with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX>, and many apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX> successfully demonstrated their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfeel‚Äù</ENAMEX> for the market early in their careers. This list includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wanamaker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early era</TIMEX> of the department store; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Marcus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nieman Marcus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millard S. Drexler</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Gap</ENAMEX> are more recent examples of ‚Äúbuyer‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEOs</ENAMEX>.5
The best traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> were also good at merchandising. Effective merchandising requires matching the retailer‚Äôs product mix to the tastes and incomes of its targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. Establishing the target customer base is therefore a critical <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in any merchandising strategy. Although this may seem obvious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wanamaker</ENAMEX> shook up the existing retail world in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX> by seeking to understand his customers‚Äô preferences as a basis for making merchandising choices<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.6</NUMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A century later</TIMEX>, retailing success is often attributed to combining effective marketing with an understanding of consumer tastes. The growth of private-label programs among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> exemplifies this trend. In private-label programs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> create a distinctive product line under their exclusive name and license. If successful, a retailer‚Äôs private-label program can capitalize on the same type of strong brand recognition that has yielded profits to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi Strauss</ENAMEX> or more recently <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Hilfiger</ENAMEX>. For example, the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Gap‚</ENAMEX>Äôs jeans, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. C. Penney‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> line, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears‚Äôs Canyon River Blue</ENAMEX> line has led to erosion of the market share held by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> leading jeans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi Strauss</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VF Corporation</ENAMEX>.7 According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄúIn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> the standout <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> in retailing developed a sustainable competitive advantage by differentiating themselves in the eyes of the consumer....The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> have either created new markets or revitalized old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> with a price and product mix geared toward a narrower market.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù8</ENAMEX>
In addition to effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> and merchandising, successful traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> relied on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> element: purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> at low costs through buying power (volume or cash position), or via access to the cheapest domestic and international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for apparel. As we‚Äôve already noted, international sourcing has become increasingly prevalent. Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> expanded their offshore sourcing efforts, especially after quality standards improved, establishing sourcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and relationships in low-wage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Growing Costs of Traditional Retailing</ENAMEX>
Nevertheless, large-scale retailing came with its own risks. Through their buying power, traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> could dramatically lower the direct costs of procurement and, in the process, usurp the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wholesalers</ENAMEX> in the apparel distribution system<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purchasing</ENAMEX> in large quantities for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, however, subjected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> to the attendant risk of selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúperishable‚Äù</ENAMEX> products like apparel. The absence of business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> capable of adjusting to real-time demand information, as well as the lack of information between the time when orders were placed and the actual selling season, meant that early order commitments could not be amended pending new information<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> In terms of the retail bottom line, this risk appeared in the indirect costs associated with holding inventories of unwanted products and stock-outs of popular items<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.11</NUMEX>
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> trends over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past twenty-five years</TIMEX> have compounded the problems inherent in the traditional retail model. First, product proliferation has vastly increased the number of products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> are required to manage in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the total amount of retail space in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has expanded dramatically, even while consumer expenditures on apparel items have declined as a share of total expenditures. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> deem this ‚Äúthe overstoring of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> have faced the growing costs associated with holding inventories of a wider variety of goods in a world increasingly characterized by industry overcapacity. Low-cost international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> helped fill the gap for a while, but the traditional retail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX> can no longer hold its own without information integration and other innovations.
Product Proliferation
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 1</ENAMEX>, we introduced the fashion triangle, which includes the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of goods commonly sold by apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>: fashion, fashion-basic, and basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX>. Although product variety in apparel has historically been associated with the fashion end of the industry, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> available to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> in almost every apparel category has grown significantly over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two decades</TIMEX>.
Consider men‚Äôs shirts. Throughout much of the post‚<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ÄìWorld War II</ENAMEX> era, the majority of men‚Äôs shirts sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> were white dress shirts. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shirt manufacturer‚Äôs ‚Äúbasic‚Äù</ENAMEX> collection typically includes solid white, blue, and a white/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">blue weave</ENAMEX>, as well as white with color stripes in pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX>, cotton/polyester blends of various mixtures, and other fabrics like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-percent <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton oxford</ENAMEX>, pinpoint oxford, and several qualities of broadcloth<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.12</NUMEX> Most of the collection will come with a choice of collar styles, and some will include a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> cuff option. There are also common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cuts (‚Äúsilhouettes‚Äù</ENAMEX>), such as regular, athletic, loose fit, and long. In addition to these dimensions, there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</TIMEX> collections of different fabrics. Each shirt corresponding to a combination of these characteristics‚Äîfor example, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16‚Äì35</NUMEX> blue, button-down, pinpoint oxford shirt with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> cuffs cut long‚Äîhas its own pattern of demand that varies considerably over the course of a year<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.13</NUMEX>
For a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX>, a larger number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKUs</ENAMEX> raises the level of uncertainty regarding what product will sell or not sell in any period. In practical terms, this means that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> carrying a broader array of goods faces increased costs both for carrying goods in inventory that will not sell (overstocks) and running out of a good that sells beyond expectations (stock-outs). The costs associated with demand uncertainty, which were previously connected primarily with fashion products‚Äîthat is, the problem of selling a highly perishable item‚Äîhave grown enormously for apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>. Apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> are not alone: The variety of products offered has increased considerably in most consumer product sectors, from most segments of the retail food industry to home building products to personal computers.14
Increasing product proliferation was clear among the business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in our survey, as vividly portrayed in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>. The average number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SKUs</ENAMEX> per business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> rose from an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,871</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,304</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. This overall increase is mirrored by growth in the average number of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKUs</ENAMEX> introduced per year by apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> units, which increased from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,368</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,688</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. Meanwhile, the number of discontinued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKUs</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">from 2,057 to 3,050</NUMEX>. This means that a large portion of each apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm‚</ENAMEX>Äôs product line consists of new products. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">consequent ‚Äúchurning‚Äù</ENAMEX> of products adds further uncertainty to the retailer‚Äôs or manufacturer‚Äôs already difficult tasks.
Retail Overcapacity
Construction of retail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, particularly shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, boomed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. Rapid expansion of retail space arose from a simple formula that had traditionally proven successful: Add more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and revenue growth will follow. The early age of retailing was marked by the expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> within major metropolitan areas, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1960s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> started flocking to large, enclosed suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> and non-enclosed ‚Äústrip <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>.‚Äù As a result, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1972 and 1992</TIMEX> the annual rate of new shopping-center construction outpaced the growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.15 The size of retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> also grew during this period because of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important trends<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, the number of independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> stores‚Äîusually a single-site enterprise of relatively moderate size‚Äîdeclined dramatically in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, many multi-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise retailers</ENAMEX> either built large new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> or expanded the size of existing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ones.17</NUMEX>
Far outpacing the overall growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, retail space per capita rose from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5.3 square feet</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 square feet</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 square feet</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, it had grown still further, reaching close to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">19 square feet</NUMEX>.18 In comparison, per capita retail space in a developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> is estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">.3 square feet</NUMEX>.
The growth in consumer expenditures did not rise commensurately with the boom in retail space. The apparel and upkeep share of household expenditures in the Consumer Price Index fell from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.6 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. Per capita expenditure for apparel and related services declined from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,710</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,698</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> (in current <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.19</NUMEX> And these downward expenditure trends occurred in the face of growth in the average number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">outerwear garments</ENAMEX> consumed per capita: from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.3</NUMEX> garments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28.7</NUMEX> garments in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1995.20</NUMEX> In other words, the amount of money spent by an average consumer per garment fell over this period, reflecting in part more casual workplaces, which allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to spend less on clothing for work, and intense price competition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Retailers</ENAMEX> with more and more floor space were chasing fewer and fewer apparel-consumption dollars<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.21</NUMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retail Fallout</ENAMEX>
Increasing product proliferation, retail overcapacity, falling relative per capita expenditures on apparel, and the constant pressure to provide lower prices to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> created an unforgiving competitive environment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>. Overall margins for the industry (particularly for specific retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> like department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>) declined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1977 and 1987</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX>, a number of the most prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> were faltering, with some filing for bankruptcy or being acquired by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>.
Department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> proved to be one of the most adversely affected retail sectors<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> Their inability to adapt to changing consumer tastes and the emergence of new retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that targeted specific consumer segments‚Äîspecialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> (especially so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúcategory killers‚Äù</ENAMEX>), catalog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, and mass merchants‚Äîled to erosion in market share. Although in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX> the majority of apparel sales occurred in department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> they accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 29 percent</NUMEX> of all sales<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.23</NUMEX> Venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macy‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gimbels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanamaker</ENAMEX> filed for bankruptcy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> and early 1990s.24
Product proliferation coupled with industry overcapacity revealed the costs inherent in the traditional model of retailing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> types of costs were particularly high under the old model: forced markdowns to clear out unsold goods; lost sales from stock-outs; and the costs asso-ciated with holding inventory. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, the losses associated with -markdowns, stock-outs, and inventory carrying costs for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> retail-apparel-textile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were estimated to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25 billion.25</NUMEX> An estimated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 percent</NUMEX> of these losses, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14 billion</NUMEX>, arose from the need to mark down unsold products, either through store sales and promotions or through the use of the sizable secondary market for items purchased by discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> for sale to other consumer segments. Product stock-outs accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 percent</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6 billion</NUMEX>, of the losses, and the cost of inventory carrying itself constituted the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 billion</NUMEX>.
Price reductions from the beginning to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the season</TIMEX> also increased dramatically over the period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948 to 1988</TIMEX>, one in which there was considerable growth in product proliferation. Consequently, the difference between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early season</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end-of-season</TIMEX> prices for women‚Äôs apparel from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1960s</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> grew substantially<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.26</NUMEX> Although these losses were borne throughout the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> to some extent, a disproportionate share, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 percent</NUMEX>, fell on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>. This is not surprising, given the traditional retailing strategy under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> commit to purchases well in advance of the selling season.
Despite its high costs and negative impact on the bottom line, being left with unwanted apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">products‚</ENAMEX>Äîor running out of fashion hits‚Äîwas viewed by most traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> as a cost of doing business. With neither timely information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of sales at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, nor the capability to use that information, little could be done to resolve this source of uncertainty and excess cost in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. This historical constraint only began to change with the advent of the current retail revolution.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lean Retailing Alternative</ENAMEX>
The whole point is speed and clarity of communications. With this new technology, buying procedures that used to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> have now been cut to days‚Äîand sometimes even <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. That has greatly enhanced our response to new trends, reduced turnaround times and increased the flexibility of all those involved in the buying process<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.27</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄîWilliam Howell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.C. Penney</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
If lack of information provided a regrettable but unavoidable cost of doing business in retailing before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>, access to information has become crucial to competitive success in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>. The ability to gather, transmit, and use information regarding sales at the cash register has created a new way of offering products to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. It has created the lean retailer<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.28</NUMEX>
The leveraged buyouts, mergers, and corporate restructuring of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> left many of the historic retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">powerhouses</ENAMEX> in a vulnerable condition, with a number of the strongest traditional retailers‚ÄîMacy‚Äôs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears‚</ENAMEX>Äîin an extremely weakened <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. But this industry landscape also left the field open for the emergence of a new kind of retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX>, one able to harness information as a central component of its competitive strategy.
A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> filled this role, becoming the vanguard of the lean retailing revolution. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lean</ENAMEX> retailing represents an amalgam of technologies and management practices adopted and refined by various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Although no single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> pioneered or adopted all the innovations that compose lean retailing, we focus here on those in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three segments‚</TIMEX>Äîmass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> stores‚Äîthat played important roles in initiating the larger transformation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mass Merchants</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> is the most well known of the early lean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>.29 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traditional</ENAMEX> mass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> sought cost advantage through economies of purchasing scale. Given limited information on sales, this meant that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> purchased large inventories of goods that they would then ‚Äúpush‚Äù to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>, often by means of price reductions and sales promotions. Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1970s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> sought to reduce its costs by using emerging information technologies to track consumer sales at the checkout counter, monitor its inventory of goods within and across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, and then supply its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> on an ongoing basis via highly efficient, centralized distribution methods. By capitalizing on ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù information on sales and inventory position, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> increased its ability to let consumer demand ‚Äúpull‚Äù its orders. As a result, it could reduce the amount of inventory it needed to hold for any given product and focus its resources on stocking those goods that were being purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> strategy required and fostered the development of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>-wide computer system to track incoming and outgoing shipments to the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. Through the use of its own proprietary standard, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> gathered and exchanged information among its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, and the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bentonville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, to monitor sales, place orders based on those sales, track shipments to the distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, and coordinate the flow of materials and information throughout the system<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.30</TIMEX> By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>, the company‚Äôs investments in this information system‚Äîincluding satellite links to handle its immense amount of daily data‚Äîtotaled <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $700 million</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX>
Wal-Mart reaped the full benefits arising from its extensive information systems when it shifted its focus from internal purposes to a means of interacting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> began its first major experiment in changing its relationship with a key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>, by establishing the ‚ÄúWal-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mart Retail Link‚</ENAMEX>Äù program. This program provided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> with access to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wal-Mart‚</ENAMEX>Äôs point-of-sales information, allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> to track sales of its products on a real-time basis and manage its inventory accordingly. In the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou Pritchett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> of sales at the time, ‚ÄúP&G could monitor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wal-Mart‚Äôs</ENAMEX> inventory and data and then use that information to make its own production and shipping plans with a great deal more efficiency. We broke new ground by using information technology to manage our business together, instead of just to audit it.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äù32</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart/Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> partnership has been often cited by the business press. The program began through an informal discussion between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Walton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble‚Äôs Pritchett</ENAMEX>. Although the effort has been characterized as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> have also noted that the initial impetus came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Walton</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> to switch from its internal proprietary standard to a more widely adopted electronic data interchange (EDI) standard, as well as to bar codes that were already in use by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kmart</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kmart</ENAMEX> was the first major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> to experiment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> led the way in structuring supply relationships and its overall competitive strategy around information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>. The program soon expanded to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>, including apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, who entered their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútrading partnerships‚Äù</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>. Thus, what began as a system focused on efficient distribution eventually evolved into the modern system of lean retailing.
National <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Chains</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. C. Penney</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. C. Penney</ENAMEX> built an internal data communications network well in advance of its use with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>.33 Point-of-sale terminals <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</TIMEX>, allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to capture information on store-level sales. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penney</ENAMEX> was also one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> to adopt scanner technologies. Although early forays into electronic data management relied on mainframe computers, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1988 and 1991</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> installed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">45,000</NUMEX> cash registers equipped with microprocessors and storage capabilities.
These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>-level investments were accompanied by major capital investments in central computer processing capacities, continuing development of store- and corporate-level software <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>, and improvements in distribution operations. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penney</ENAMEX> drew on these systems to allow corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> to display potential products to geographically dispersed individual store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchandisers</ENAMEX> who, with store <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, had considerable autonomy within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. This information infrastructure proved most beneficial when it gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penney‚</ENAMEX>Äôs major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> access to sales data via direct broadcast satellite. There was initial resistance, however. Despite the company‚Äôs offer to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDI</ENAMEX> downloads, many declined because of their inability to process the data. It was only when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penney</ENAMEX> provided aggregated reports via fax to account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> agreed. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penney</ENAMEX> was using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDI</ENAMEX> for processing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97 percent</NUMEX> of purchase orders and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> of invoices with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,400</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, many small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> did not have electronic links with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.34</NUMEX>
It is no accident that such innovative information and distribution relationships with key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> emerged through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kmart</ENAMEX>, and a national chain like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. C. Penney</ENAMEX> rather than among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> or specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. The larger size of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass merchants</ENAMEX> facilitated adoption of rapid-replenishment practices as a result of economies of scale in inbound and outbound transportation, information technology, and distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> operations. Indeed, the adoption of these distribution innovations parallels the emergence of department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and mail-order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century earlier</TIMEX>.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass merchants</ENAMEX> and national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> cover a more narrow range of products‚Äîprimarily basic apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">items‚</ENAMEX>Äîthan department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. Basic products are prime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for lean retailing because such a product style remains in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> and apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company‚</ENAMEX>Äôs product line over much of the selling season and often over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>. That makes it easier to use information acquired during the selling season for replenishment during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same season</TIMEX> or for forecasting future demand. Basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">items</ENAMEX> also represent a major percentage of all apparel goods sold. In our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> HCTAR sample, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 percent</NUMEX> of all shipments by business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, weighted by sales volume, could be classified as basic. Therefore, given their scale and product mix, it is not surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kmart</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. C. Penney</ENAMEX> were among the early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> of lean retailing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department Stores</ENAMEX>: Dillard‚Äôs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX>
Although providing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> with low prices for a limited range of goods underpins the strategy of mass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> (going back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wanamaker</ENAMEX>) rely on offering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> a diverse and exciting collection of goods. The focus of department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> tends to be on the middle and higher portion of the fashion triangle; consequently, lean retailing came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of the industry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillard‚Äôs</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> in the use of information technology for tracking and responding to sales. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillard‚Äôs</ENAMEX> became one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> to build a centralized inventory-tracking system to provide its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Rock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, with real-time information on sales, by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and item<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.35</NUMEX> This entailed buying and then adapting early scanning technologies for use at sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counters</ENAMEX> and for point-of-sale data collection. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillard‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also purchased computing capacity for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and its headquarters <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, along with the necessary equipment to connect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> to the head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> via electronic data transmission.
With these systems in place, it began to develop distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> capable of being efficient intermediaries between its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. Finally, like the mass <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard‚Äôs</ENAMEX> started insisting that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> invest in corresponding technologies to allow electronic reordering and to meet its increasingly stringent service requirements. But unlike a mass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX> that typically manages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 125,000</NUMEX> separate items in a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> uses this information to manage over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKUs</ENAMEX> in one of its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.36
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> originated as a decentralized ‚Äúfederation‚Äù of well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rich‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, with wide variation in both its merchandising and back-room activities. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> carry a vast array of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX>: a typical department store may have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800,000</NUMEX> items; its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs in midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two million</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKUs</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, however, the amount of inventory held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> ballooned while it faced bankruptcy.
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Questrom</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> addressed these problems by attempting to increase its inventory turns (the number of times a year that goods turned over in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>) and reduce its exposure to losses from excess inventories. This entailed instituting aggressive markdown policies in the short term to remove large inventories that had built up in many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> began to redesign its logistics system‚Äîthe method it used to move goods from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>, through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX>, and to delivery at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.
The size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated‚</ENAMEX>Äôs logistics challenge can be captured by the following figures. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> moved over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, requiring an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">500</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> deliveries per day, which amounted to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thirty million miles</NUMEX> for deliveries per year<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Like Dillard‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. C. Penney</ENAMEX>, and others, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> on installing scanners, adopting bar codes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDI</ENAMEX> to communicate internally and with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>. Given the size of its logistics challenge, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> also chose to redesign its methods of moving goods from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. With the establishment of an independent operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Logistics</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> reduced the amount of time required to process merchandise in distribution <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX>, to an average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> sought to maintain the strengths of its divisions‚ÄîMacy‚Äôs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, in particular‚Äîin merchandising. It created, among other innovations, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúteam buying‚</ENAMEX>Äù system that centralizes certain buying functions to benefit from potential economies of scale while taking full advantage of divisional expertise regarding different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customer groups</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Federated‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. Yet a tension exists between its desire to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> with a changing variety of apparel fashions and the need to increase its capacity to replenish a higher percentage of products, thereby taking advantage of its expertise in logistics<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.38</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Increasingly</ENAMEX>, a department store must be successful at both pursuits. We discuss the trade-off arising from providing new products with little information on consumer demand (fashion products) and replenishing items on the basis of sales (historically limited to more basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX>) in detail in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 6</ENAMEX>.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rapid climb has created the most sound and fury, a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> adopted and adapted different pieces of lean retailing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>. Note that the push toward rapid replenishment, reduction of lead times, and what has often been called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúquick response‚Äù</ENAMEX> came predominately from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> rather than from their apparel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX>.39
The next chapter analyzes the building blocks of lean retailing, drawing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> described above as well as others. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 5</ENAMEX> discusses how the retail revolution has led to a tremendous shift in bargaining power within the channel‚Äîaway from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> and toward lean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX>.
