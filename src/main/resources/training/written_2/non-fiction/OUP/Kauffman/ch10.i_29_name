A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coconstructing</ENAMEX> Cosmos?
rom biospheres to the cosmos? Yes, because they may share general themes. The major enquiry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investigations</ENAMEX> has concerned autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and their coconstruction of biospheres and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">econospheres</ENAMEX> whose configuration spaces cannot be finitely prestated. These themes find echoes in thinking about the cosmos as a whole. But abundant caution: I am not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX>, the problems are profound, and we risk nonsense.
Whatever the risk, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> facts are true. First, since the big bang our universe has become enormously complex. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we do not have a theory for why the universe is complex. Equally unarguably, the biosphere has increased in molecular diversity over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four billion years</TIMEX>, just as the standing diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has increased. And equally unarguably, the econosphere has become more complex over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few million years</TIMEX> of hominid evolution. We know this with confidence. If we lack a theory, it is not because the staggering facts of increasing diversity and complexity that stare us in the face do not deserve a theory to account for them.
But we have seen hints of such a theory in the coconstruction of biospheres and econospheres by the self-consistent search of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for ways to make a living, the resulting exapting novel ways of making livings, the fact that new adjacent niches for yet further new species grow in diversity faster than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> creates those new adjacent possible niches, and the search mechanisms to master those modes of being. We have seen a glimmer of something like a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law, a tendency for self-constructing biospheres to enlarge their workspace, the dimensionality of their adjacent possible, perhaps as fast, on average, as is possible¬†¬†glimmers only, not yet well-founded theory nor well-established fact. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">glimmers</ENAMEX> often precede later science.
Consider again how the chemical diversity of the biosphere has become more diverse in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four billion years</TIMEX>, urged into its adjacent possible by the genuine chemical potential from the chemical actual into the adjacent possible, where the actual substrates exist and the adjacent possible products do not yet exist. Each time the molecular diversity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">biosphere</ENAMEX> expands, the set of adjacent possible reactions expands even faster. Recall our simple calculation that for modestly complex organic molecules, any pair of molecules could undergo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one two</NUMEX> substrate‚Äìtwo product reaction. But then the diversity of possible reactions is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> in the system. As the diversity of molecular species increases, there are always proportionally more novel reactions into the adjacent possible. If we take the formation of a chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that has never existed in the biosphere, or perhaps the universe, as a breaking symmetry, then the more such symmetries are broken, the more ways come into existence by which yet further symmetries may be broken.
And the chemical case makes clear the linking of the flows of matter and energy in this sprawling chemical diversity explosion. Many such reactions will link exergonic and endergonic processes. As this occurs, energy is pumped from the exergonic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> into the products requiring endergonic synthesis. These products¬†¬†the chemical diversity in the bark of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">redwood tree</ENAMEX>, for example¬†¬†take their place in the chemical actual, poising the biosphere, and thus the universe, for its next plunge into the chemical adjacent possible.
Consider again equilibrium statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>. At its core, statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> relies on the same kind of statistical argument as does the flipping of a fair coin , times. We all understand that distributions of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> and , tails are far more probable macrostates than distributions with all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> or all tails. Now consider the general argument I have made that as molecular diversity increases, the diversity of reactions increases even faster, and that there is a genuine chemical potential from the actual into the adjacent possible. And consider again the general argument made just above that the greater the diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> and reactions, the more likely the coupling of exergonic and endergonic reaction pairs driving the endergonic synthesis of new adjacent possible molecules that poise the system to advance again into the next adjacent possible. While the detailed statistical form of these chemical reaction graphs are not yet known, they too smell of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúlaw</ENAMEX>.‚Äù As in the case of fair coin flips and equilibrium statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, it is as if here again the mathematical structure compels the consequent behavior of matter and energy. In the case of the nonergodic and nonequilibrium chemical flux into the adjacent possible, the universe is busy diversifying itself into myriad complexity.
The universe is enormously complex, and we don‚Äôt really yet know why. May there be new ways of thinking of the cosmos itself? If a mere glimmer can be acceptable as potentially useful early science, then the burden of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> is to suggest perhaps, yes.
It is not obvious, in fact, that the universe should be complex. One can imagine universes governed by general relativity that burst briefly into big bang being, then recollapse in a rapid big crunch within parts of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX>. Alternatively, one can imagine universes governed by general relativity that burst into big bang being and expanded forever with no further complexity than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX> and helium and smaller particles in an open and ever-expanding dark, cold vastness.
Here we are, poised, it seems (but see below) between a universe that will expand forever and a universe that will eventually ease into gentle contraction, then rush to a big crunch.
Our fundamental theories in physics, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> level up, biology, remain un-united. Einstein‚Äôs austere general relativity, our theory of space, time, and geometry on the macroscale, floats untethered to quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, our theory of the microscale, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy-five years</TIMEX> after quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> emerged in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs equation form for wave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>. Theoretically apart, general relativity and quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> are both verified to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> decimal places by appropriate tests. But it remains true that general relativity and quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> remain fitfully fit, fitfully un-united. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs view of persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coevolution</ENAMEX> remains by and large unconnected with our fundamental physics, even though the evolution of the biosphere is manifestly a physical process in the universe. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Physicists</ENAMEX> cannot escape this problem by saying, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs biology.‚Äù
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Complexity of the Universe</ENAMEX>
Why the universe is complex rather than simple is, in fact, beginning to emerge as a legitimate and deep question. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>, I have had the pleasure to come to know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Smolin</ENAMEX>, whose career is devoted to quantum gravity and cosmology. Most of what I shall write in this chapter reflects my conversations and work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, who have been wonderfully welcoming to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX>. Sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> can make serious contributions. Sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsiders</ENAMEX> just make damned fools of themselves.
Caveat lector, but I will continue.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smolin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Life of the Cosmos</ENAMEX>, he raises directly the question of why the universe is complex. Current particle physics has united <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fundamental forces¬†¬†the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äústandard model</ENAMEX>.‚Äù With general relativity, which deals with the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, gravity; this provides a consistent framework. Particle physics plus general relativity have altogether some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty ‚Äúconstants‚Äù</TIMEX> of nature, which are parameters of the standard model and general relativity, such as the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck‚</ENAMEX>Äôs constant, h; the fine structure constant, that is, the ratio of the electron rest mass to proton rest mass; the gravitational constant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>; and so forth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smolin</ENAMEX> puts approximate maximum and minimum bounds on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these twenty constants</TIMEX> and asks a straightforward question: In a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-dimensional</TIMEX> parameter space ranging over the plausible values of these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty constants</TIMEX>, what volume of that parameter space is consistent with values of the constants that would yield a complex universe with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, chemistry, and potentially, life?
Smolin‚Äôs rough answer is that the volume of parameter space for the constants of nature that would yield a complex universe are something like raised to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">minus th</NUMEX> power. That is, a tiny fraction of the possible combinations of the values of the constants are consistent with the existence of chemistry and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, as well as life. For the universe to be complex, the constants must be sharply tuned.
Smolin‚Äôs argument could be o by many orders of magnitude without destroying his central point: The fact that our universe is complex, based on our current theories of the standard model and general relativity, is surprising, even astonishingly surprising.
Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> have remarked upon this fine tuning of the constants.
There have been several responses to this issue, some raised prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smolin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs work. One is based on a view of multiple universes and the ‚Äúweak anthropic principle.‚Äù This principle states that there exist multiple universes, but only those universes that were complex would sport life forms with the wit to wonder why their universe was complex. So the very fact that we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are here to wonder about this issue merely means that we happen to be in one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> universes among vastly many universes. The argument is at least coherent. But it‚Äôs hard to be thrilled by this answer.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äústrong anthropic principle‚Äù goes further¬†¬†indeed</ENAMEX>, too far¬†¬†and posits that, for mysterious reasons, the universe is contrived such that life must arise to observe it and wonder at it. Few think the strong anthropic principle counts as science in any guise.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Smolin</NUMEX> points out that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible answers to the puzzle of the complexity of the universe. Either we will find a parameter-free description¬†¬†a kind of supertheory¬†¬†that yields something like our complex universe with its constants, or some historical process must pick those constants. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smolin</ENAMEX> proposes the possibility of ‚Äúcosmic natural selection.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù Here</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> universes are born of black holes. Universes with more black holes will have more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> universes. Given minor heritable variation in the constants of the laws of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> universes, cosmic natural selection will select for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">universes</ENAMEX> whose constants support the formation of a near-maximum number of black holes. He then argues that on very crude calculations most alterations in the known constants would be expected to lower the number of black holes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> points out that his theory is testable, for example, by deducing that our constants correspond to near-maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">black hole</ENAMEX> production, and that his theory has not been ruled out yet.
I confess I am fond of and admire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Smolin</ENAMEX> a great deal, but I don‚Äôt like his hypothesis. Why? Well, preferably, one would like a theory that had the consequence that any universe would be complex like ours and roughly poised between expansion and contraction. We have no such theory at present, of course. The remainder of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> discusses ideas and a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> that just might point in this direction.
As a start, we can begin with the most current view of the large-scale structure and dynamics of the universe. The most recent evidence suggests that on a large enough scale the universe is flat, the matter distribution is isotropic, and¬†¬†a recent surprise¬†¬†the universe may be expanding at an accelerating rate. This latest result, if it holds true, contravenes the accepted view of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several decades</TIMEX> that the rate of expansion of the universe has been gradually slowing since the big bang. The hypothesis that the universe is exactly poised between persistent expansion and eventual collapse has held that the rate of expansion of the universe will gradually slow, but never stop.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to explain a persistent accelerating expansion of a flat universe is to reintroduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Einstein‚Äôs ‚Äúcosmological constant‚Äù</ENAMEX> into the field equations of general relativity. A positive cosmological constant expresses itself as a repulsive force between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> that increases with the distance between those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> think that a positive cosmological constant must be associated with some new source of energy in free space. The source of such an energy is currently unknown.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum Mechanics</ENAMEX> and Classicity
Before turning to the huge diculties of quantum gravity, we should review the fundamental mystery of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> are familiar with the famous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-slit experiment, which exhibits the fundamental oddness of quantum interference. Feynman, in his famous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-volume lectures on physics, gives the mystery as simply as possible: We begin with a gun shooting bullets. The bullets pass through one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> holes in a metal plate and fly further on, landing on a flat layer of sand in a box. Bullets passing through either hole may be deflected slightly by hitting the walls of the hole. Thus, in the sandbox behind the metal plate, we would expect, and actually would find, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mounds of bullets. Each mound would be centered on the line of flight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> through the corresponding hole to the sandbox, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúGaussian‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">normal bell</TIMEX>-shaped distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> densities falling away from the peak of each mound.
When we use monochromatic light rather than bullets, we note the following: If the light hits the sandbox, changed into a photon-counter surface, we find that the size of the energetic impact is the same each time a photon hits the surface. Photons of a given wavelength have a fixed energy. A photon either is recorded at a point on the surface or not. Whenever one is recorded, the full parcel of energy has been detected at the surface. Now if only one hole is open, one gets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> mound result. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photons</ENAMEX> pass through the hole unscathed and arrive in a straight line at the photon-counter surface. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gaussian</ENAMEX> distribution peaked at that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is present because some photons are deflected slightly by the edges of the hole.
But if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> holes are open, then one gets the famous interference pattern of light and dark interfering circles spreading from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> on the photon-counter surface that were the peaks of the mounds seen when hole or hole was open. Of course, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feynman</ENAMEX> points out, there is no way to account for this oddness in classical physics.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> was built to account for the phenomenon. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> equation is a wave equation. The wave that propagates from the photon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> is an undulating spherically spreading wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">probability ‚Äúamplitude</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The amplitude at any point in space and time is the square root of the probability that the photon will be found located at that point. To obtain the actual probability, the amplitude must be squared.
A central feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs equation is its linearity. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> waves are propagating, the sum and dierences of those waves are also propagating. It is the essential linearity of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> that makes the next puzzle, the link from quantum to classical worlds, so dicult. For a central puzzle of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> becomes the relation between this odd quantum world of possible events, where the possibilities can propagate, but never become actual, and the classical world of actual events.
A variety of approaches to the liaison between the quantum and classical realms exist. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is the ‚ÄúCopenhagen interpretation,‚Äù which speaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">‚Äúmeasurement</ENAMEX> event,‚Äù when the quantum object interacts with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a macroscopic</NUMEX> classical object, the measuring device, and a single one of the propagating possibilities becomes actual in the measurement event, thereby ‚Äúcollapsing‚Äù the wave function. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> approach is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Everett</ENAMEX> multiworld hypothesis, which asserts that every time a quantum choice happens, the universe splits into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parallel universes. No one seems too happy with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Everett</ENAMEX> interpretation. And few seem very sure what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copenhagen</ENAMEX> interpretation‚Äôs collapse of the wave function might really mean.
Meanwhile, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other long-standing approaches to the link between the quantum and classical worlds. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous sum over all possible trajectories, or histories, approach. In quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, we are to imagine a given possible pathway of the photon from the photon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> through the screen with the two slits to the photon-counting surface. For each pathway, there is a well-defined procedure to assign an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúaction</ENAMEX>.‚Äù This action can be thought of as having an amplitude and a phase, and the phase rotates through a full circle, pi, many times along the pathway. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feynman</ENAMEX> scheme, classical trajectories correspond to quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pathways</ENAMEX> possessing minimal action.
Consider, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feynman</ENAMEX>, all the pathways that start at the photon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and end up at the same point on the photon-counting surface. Nearly parallel, nearly straight-line pathways, have nearly the same action. So when those pathways interact, they have nearly the same phase, and their interaction yields constructive interference, which tends to build up amplitude. Thus, pathways that are near the classical pathway interact constructively to build up amplitude. By contrast, quirky crooked pathways between the photon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and the same point on the counter screen have very dierent actions, hence very dierent phases, and interact destructively, so their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amplitudes</ENAMEX> tend to cancel. The classical pathway, therefore, is simultaneously the most probable pathway over the sum of histories of all possible pathways, and the pathway that requires the least action.
The result is beautiful, but has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> problems. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman</ENAMEX> assumes a continuous background space and time in his theory. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> gravity, as we will see, cannot make that assumption in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place. Rather space, or geometry, is a discrete, self-constructing object on its own. Thus, achieving a smooth space and time is supposed to be a consequence of an adequate theory of quantum gravity. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sum over histories must assume a smooth background space and time, then it cannot as such be taken as primitive in quantum gravity. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, granting a continuous background space and time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sum over all histories still only gives a maximum of the amplitude for the photon to travel the classical pathway, it never gives an actual photon arriving at the counting surface. No more than any other does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feynman</ENAMEX> overcome the fundamental linearity of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>. We still have to collapse the wave function. Despite these problems, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚Äôs</ENAMEX> results are brilliant, and at least we see a link between the classical and quantum worlds, if not yet actual photons striking counters.
But there is an alternative approach to the link between the quantum and the classical worlds. This possible approach is based on the well-established phenomenon of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúdecoherence</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Decoherence</ENAMEX> arises when a quantum-coherent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> wave is propagating and the quantum system interacts with another quantum system having many coupled variables, or degrees of freedom. The consequence can be that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> wave function of the first quantum system becomes entangled in very complex ways with the other complex quantum system, which may be thought of as the environment. Rather like water waves swirling into tiny granular nooks and crannies along a rugged fractal beach, the initial coherent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> equation representing the initial quantum system swirls into tiny and highly diverse patterns of interaction with the quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> representing the environment. The consequence of this intermixing is decoherence.
To understand the core of decoherence, one must understand that the exhibition of interference phenomena, the hallmark of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> noted in the double-slit photon experiment, requires that literally all the propagating possible pathways in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sum over histories that are to arrive at each point on the photon-counter surface, do in fact arrive at that point. If some fail to arrive, the sum over all histories fails. In eect, if some of the phase information, the core of constructive and destructive interference, has been lost in the maze of interactions of the quantum system with its environment, then that phase information cannot come to be reassembled to give rise to quantum interference.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decoherence</ENAMEX> is accepted by most physicists. For example, in attempts to build quantum computers that can carry out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> calculation simultaneously due to the linear features of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, actual decoherence is currently a technical hurdle in obtaining complex quantum calculations.
Decoherence, then, aords a way that phase information can be lost, thereby collapsing the wave function in a nonmysterious fashion. Thus, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> hope that decoherence provides a natural link between the quantum and classical realms. Notable among these physicists are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hartle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Gell-Mann</ENAMEX>, whose views can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gell-Mann‚</ENAMEX>Äôs The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quark</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>. In essence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gell-Mann</ENAMEX> ask us to consider ‚Äúthe quantum state of the universe‚Äù and all possible quantum histories of the universe from its initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Some of these histories of the universe may happen to decohere. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gell-Mann</ENAMEX> argue that the decoherent histories of the universe, where true probabilities can be assigned, rather than mere amplitudes, correspond to the classical realm. Others have argued that decoherence itself can be insucient for classical behavior.
It is striking that there appear to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> such separate accounts of the relation between the quantum and classical worlds, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sum over histories in a smooth background space-time and decoherence. For an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>, it is hard to believe that both can be correct unless there is some way to derive one from the other. I will explore <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such possibility below. In particular, I will explore the possibility that decoherence of quantum geometries is primary and might yield a smooth space-time in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚Äôs</ENAMEX> account is secondarily correct.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outsider‚Äôs Doubts</ENAMEX>
I turn next to an outsider‚Äôs grounds for doubts about some of the core propositions of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland Omnes</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</ENAMEX>, is at pains to argue that decoherence is the plausible route to classicity. In his discussion, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major points leap to attention. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> concerns the concept of an elementary predicate in quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> is stated in the framework of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilbert</ENAMEX> spaces, which are finite or infinite-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> spaces, that is, spaces comprised of finite or infinite vectors of complex numbers. In eect, an elementary predicate is a measurement about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúobservable‚Äù</ENAMEX> that returns a value drawn from some set of possible values. And so the first striking point is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnes‚</ENAMEX>Äô claim that all possible observables can be stated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hilbert</ENAMEX> space. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> striking point is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnes‚</ENAMEX>Äô claim that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observables</ENAMEX> cannot be observed.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> point is striking because it is not at all clear that all possible observables can be finitely stated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hilbert</ENAMEX> space. My issue here is precisely the same as my issue with whether or not the configuration space of the biosphere is finitely prestatable. As I argued above, there does not seem to be a finite prestatement of all possible causal consequences of parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that may turn out to be useful adaptations in our or any biosphere, which arise by exaptation and are incorporated in the ongoing unfolding exploration of the adjacent possible by a biosphere.
In quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, an observable corresponds to a mathematical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> that ‚Äúprojects out‚Äù the subspace of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hilbert</ENAMEX> space corresponding to the desired observable in a classical measurement context that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> of the presence or absence of the observable. But the biosphere is part of the physical universe, and the exapted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gertrude</ENAMEX> the flying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">squirrel</ENAMEX> are manifestly observables, albeit classical observables. If we cannot finitely prestate the observable, ‚ÄúGertrude‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX>,‚Äù then we cannot finitely prestate an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hilbert</ENAMEX> space to detect the presence or absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gertrude‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX>. In short, there seems to be no way to prespecify either the quantum or classical variables that will become relevant to the physical evolution of the universe.
It turns out that the above issues may bear on the problem of time in general relativity, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Smolin</ENAMEX> realized from our conversations and as I return to shortly.
Now, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> point. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnes</ENAMEX> follows up on it. An observable requires a measuring device. There are some conceivable observables for which the measuring device would be so massive that it would, of itself, cause the formation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">black hole</ENAMEX>. Thus, no information resulting from the measurement could be communicated to the outside world beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">black hole</ENAMEX>.
A strange situation; even if we could finitely prestate all possible observables, only some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observables</ENAMEX> can manage to get themselves observed in the physical universe.
What shall we make of conceivable observables that cannot, in principle, be observed? More important, it seems to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>, is the following: If observation happens by coupling a quantum system to some other system, quantum or classical, whereby decoherence occurs and, in turn, classicity arises because loss of phase information precludes later reassembly of all the phase information to yield quantum interference, then there appears to be a relation between an observable being observed and the very decoherence by which something actual arises from the quantum amplitude haze.
If that is correct, then only those observables that can get themselves observed can, in principle, become actual. More, it begins to seem imperative to consider the specific possible pairs of quantum systems that can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> and decohere, for only thereby can such pairs become classical via decoherence. This begins to suggest preferred histories of the universe concerning such comeasuring pairs of quantum systems. Preferentially, those comeasuring pairs of quantum systems that decohere and become classical will tend to accumulate, due to the irreversibility of classicity. Thereafter quantum-classical pairs of systems that cause decoherence of the quantum system will preferentially accumulate into classicity.
If comeasuring yields classicity, and classicity is irreversible, the classical universe begins to appear to coconstruct itself. In particular, it is generally accepted that bigger systems, that is, systems with more coupled degrees of freedom, decohere more rapidly when they interact than smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX>. If so, this begins to refine the suggestion of preferred histories of the universe concerning comeasuring pairs of quantum systems toward a preference for the emergence of classical diversity and complexity: If quantum systems with more coupled degrees of freedom irreversibly decohere more rapidly into classical behavior when they interact than smaller, simpler systems, then the kinetics of decoherence should persistently favor the irreversible accumulation of bigger, more complex quantum systems, rather than of smaller, simpler, quantum systems.
Chemistry should be an example. Molecules are quantum objects, yet flow into the chemical adjacent possible. The adjacent possible explodes ever more rapidly as molecular diversity, and hence molecular complexity, increases. Reactions of complex molecules are precise examples of the couplings of quantum systems whereby <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decoherence</ENAMEX> can happen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Decoherence</ENAMEX> presumably happens more rapidly among complex reacting molecules than among very simple molecules or the same total number of mere atoms, nucleons, and electrons in the same total volume. This hypothesis ought to be open to experimental test. If confirmed, the flow of possible quantum events into the chemical adjacent possible should, in part, be made irreversible by the decoherence of complex molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> as they couple and react with one another.
If the general property obtains that complex quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to and interact with other complex quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> in more ways than can simple systems and that the number of ways of coupling explodes faster than the diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, and thus faster than the complexity of those quantum objects, then decoherence should tend to lead to favored pathways toward the accumulation of complex classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> and processes. I return to these themes below.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Problem of Time</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Relativity</ENAMEX>
To my delight, I soon found myself coauthor on a paper with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Smolin</ENAMEX> concerning the problem of time in general relativity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX> had done the majority of the work, but had taken very seriously my concern that one cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere.
In general relativity, space-time replaces space plus time. A history becomes a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúworld-line‚</NUMEX>Äù in space-time. But that world-line is a geometrical object in spacetime. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> itself seems to disappear in general relativity, to be replaced by the geometrical world-line object in space-time.
But argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, with my name appended, general relativity assumes that one can prestate the configuration space of a universe. In that prestated configuration space, a world-line is, indeed, merely a geometrical object. What if one cannot prestate the configuration space of the universe? If so, one cannot get started on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Einstein‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX>, even if general relativity is otherwise correct. As concrete examples, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> pointed out that four-dimensional manifolds are not classifiable.
How might one do physics without prestating the configuration space of the universe? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee</ENAMEX> postulated use of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, as described below, with the universe constructing itself from some initial spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. In this picture, time and its passage is real. If there can be a framework in which time enters naturally, and possibly there is a natural flow of time, or an arrow of time preferentially from past to future, then, among other possible consequences, we may be able to break the matter-antimatter symmetry, for antimatter can be stated as the corresponding matter flowing backward in time. Break the symmetry of time in fundamental physics and you may buy for free the breaking of the symmetry between matter and antimatter. If time flows preferentially from past to future, matter dominates antimatter. That would be convenient since matter does dominate antimatter, and no one knows just why.
We will head in this direction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spin Networks</ENAMEX>
For the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty years</TIMEX> following and the emergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">matrix mechanics</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> formulation of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, scant progress was made on quantum gravity. Now, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade or so</TIMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternative approaches, string theory and spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, string theory has captured the greatest attention. I discuss it briefly below.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> were invented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Penrose</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades ago</TIMEX> as a framework to think about a quantized geometry. Quite astonishingly, spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> appear to have emerged from a direct attempt to quantize general relativity by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo Rovelli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Smolin</ENAMEX>. In outline, part of the tension between quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> and general relativity lies in the very linearity of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> and the deep nonlinearity of general relativity.
Building on work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astekar</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rovelli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smolin</ENAMEX> proceeded directly from general relativity along somewhat familiar pathways of canonical quantization. In outline, general relativity is based on a metric tensor concerning space-time. The metric tensor is a x symmetric tensor. It turns out that this tensor yields <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> constraint equations. The solutions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> have turned out to be spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. The solution of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> equation would yield the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamiltonian</ENAMEX> function, hence the temporal unfolding, of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in a space x time quantum gravity.
Spin network theories can be constructed in dierent dimensions. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most familiar are for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spatial and one temporal or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> spatial and one temporal dimension. We will concern ourselves with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> for concreteness. The minimal objects in a spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> are discrete combinatorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> that constitute first a tetrahedron, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> vertices and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triangular</ENAMEX> faces. A tetrahedron represents a primitive discrete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of geometry, or space. Integer-valued labels are present on the edges and vertices of these tetrahedra. The labels on the edges represent spin <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The labels on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vertices represent ‚Äúintertwinors‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> how edges entering a vertex are connected to one another into and out of the vertex.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Analytic</ENAMEX> work has associated an area with a face of a tetrahedron and a volume with its volume. There is, at present, no way to represent the length of an edge connecting vertices. On the other hand, one can think of the integer values on the edges around a face of a tetrahedron as associated with the area of the tetrahedron, such that larger integers correspond to larger areas.
A geometry is built up by minimal moves, called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúPachner</ENAMEX> moves,‚Äù in which a given tetrahedron can give rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> tetrahedra o each face. In addition, several tetrahedra can collapse to a single tetrahedron.
Thus we may picture an initial spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, say, a single tetrahedron. In analogy with chemistry and combinatorial objects, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set of a chemical reaction graph, and the adjacent possible in the chemical reaction graph, we may consider the single initial tetrahedron as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> . Consider next all possible adjacent spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> constructible in any single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachner</ENAMEX> move. Let these <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> adjacent possible spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> lie in an adjacent ring, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> . In turn, consider all the spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> constructible for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first time</TIMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pachner</ENAMEX> moves, hence constructible for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachner</ENAMEX> move from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>- set of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. Let this new set be the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>- set of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
By iteration, we can construct a graph connecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with its -<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pachner</ENAMEX> move ‚Äúdescendants,‚Äù -<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pachner</ENAMEX> move descendints,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†N-Pachner</ENAMEX> move descendents.
Each spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> represents a specific geometry, subject to the constraint that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spin network tetrahedra that share <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one triangular</NUMEX> face must assign the same spin labels to the common edges, hence, the same area to the common face.
Changes in the values of spins on the edges that change the areas and volumes of the tetrahedra can be thought of as deforming the geometry so that it warps in dierent ways. However, it should be stressed that there is no continuous background space or space-time in this discrete picture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geometry</ENAMEX> is nothing but a spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, and a change in geometry is nothing but a change in the tetrahedral structure of the spin network by adding or deleting tetrahedra or by changing the spin values on the edges of tetrahedra.
Within quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, there is an appropriate way to consider the discrete analogue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs equation, namely a means over time of evolving amplitudes from an initial distribution. In particular, the appropriate means of evolving amplitudes concern what are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúfundamental amplitudes</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which specify initial and final values of the integer values on edges before and after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachner</ENAMEX> moves.
Consider a given graph linking spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> from an initial tetrahedron in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> , outward as in a mandala, to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> networks in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> ,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†¬†¬†gamma N</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> can grow large without limit.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Emergence of a Large-Scale Classical Limit</ENAMEX>?
I now describe one approach to thinking about quantum gravity and the emergence of a smooth large-scale geometry based on this mandala and on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs idea of a sum over all histories. Endow the spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> throughout with the same fundamental amplitudes, thus, the same law propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">amplitudes</ENAMEX> applies everywhere in the spin network mandala. Begin with all amplitude concentrated in the initial spin network tetrahedron in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> . In this vision, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of time elapsing is associated with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachner</ENAMEX> move, such as a move from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> to a point in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> . With analogy to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sum over all possible histories, consider the set of all pathways that begin at the initial tetrahedron in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> and end on a given specific spin network <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> time steps later, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = . That final spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> might lie in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>- ring, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>- ring, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>- ring, or any ring out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ring.
Here is a hopeful intuition that may prove true. If we consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of all histories beginning on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> and ending in a specific spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = ring, those pathways must be very similar and few in number. By contrast, if we consider all pathways length that begin on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma- tetrahedron</ENAMEX> and end, steps later, on a specific spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>- ring after wandering all over the spin network mandala graph, there may be many such pathways, and they can be very dissimilar. Now, during the amplitude propagation along any pathway, an action can be associated with each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachner</ENAMEX> move, hence, we can, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman</ENAMEX>, think about the constructive or destructive interference among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of pathways steps long that begin on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma- tetrahedron</ENAMEX> and end on any specific spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Then the hopeful intuition is that those pathways that begin on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> and end on a spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pachner</ENAMEX> moves will have very nearly the same action, hence, show strong constructive interference. By contrast, those pathways that begin on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma- tetrahedron</ENAMEX> and end, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pachner</ENAMEX> moves later, on a specific spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>- ring will have very dierent actions, hence, show strongly destructive interference.
If the constructive interference among the few pathways to ring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> overwhelms any residual constructive interference in the inner rings¬†¬†such as ring , due to the larger number of pathways from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma ¬†¬</ENAMEX>†then the hopeful concept is that amplitude will tend to accumulate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ring. Then (goes the hope shared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smolin</ENAMEX>) the neighboring spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> shell constitute nearly the same geometry and nearly the same action in the sum of histories reaching them, which begins to suggest that a smooth large-scale geometry might emerge.
For this line of theory to succeed, it is not actually necessary that amplitude <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">preferentially</ENAMEX> accumulate in the outermost, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, ring. Rather it is necessary as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> increases that there be some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> is less than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> but increases monotonically with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, such that a suciently large number of alternative pathways with suciently similar phase end on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> ring that constructive interference is maximum for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> ring. Further, it is necessary that as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> increases and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> increases, amplitude continue to accumulate on the Mth ring.
In short, the concept is that, via constructive and destructive interference as amplitudes propagate in the mandala, some large-scale smooth geometry will pile up amplitude, hence probability, and a smooth classical geometry will emerge. Here is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> image of how a large-scale smooth geometry might emerge from spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and constructive interference.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least three</NUMEX> major caveats are required. First, no calculation has yet been carried out for such a model, so such a theory may not work. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sum over histories assumes a classical continuous space and time. It may be entirely invalid to attempt to use a sum over histories argument in this quantum geometry setting. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, assuming we can use Feynman‚Äôs sum over histories, we still have possible quantum geometries, not an actual geometry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Self-Selection of the Laws and Constants of Nature</ENAMEX>?
Recall the puzzle, nay, the deep mystery, about what processes, if any, might have ‚Äúchosen‚Äù the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> constants in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the standard</TIMEX> model such that the universe happens, improbably, to be complex. To answer this deep mystery we have, at present, the anthropic principle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Smolin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs concept of cosmic natural selection for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">black hole</ENAMEX> density, and the hope to find the ultimate parameter-free theory that would not require multiple universes or a historical process.
With caveats, I now briefly describe a way that may be useful to begin to think about the emergence of the constants such that any universe would have a given set of constants.
Tuning the constants corresponds to tuning the laws of physics. Is there a way to imagine a self-tuning of a universe to pick the appropriate values of its constants, to tune its own laws? I think the answer may be yes. And if the following is wrong in detail, the pattern of thought may prove useful.
In the spin network mandala picture, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, present throughout the spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in the mandala, generates an analogue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs equation, hence, the means to propagate amplitudes in the graph of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. Thus, a change in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> would correspond to changing the laws of physics about how amplitudes propagate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the fundamental amplitudes are an ordered listing of integers, hence, there is a family of all possible fundamental amplitudes. Since each fundamental amplitude can be thought of as the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúlaw‚Äù</ENAMEX> about propagating amplitudes among spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Crane</ENAMEX> pointed out that there is an infinite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of all possible laws to propagate amplitude among spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>.
Thus, imagine an infinite stack of our spin network mandalas, in which each manadala is a graph from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> , the tetrahedron, outward to gamma <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> allowed to be arbitrarily large, of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> reachable in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> steps by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachner</ENAMEX> moves. The mandala <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the infinite stack of mandalas dier from one another only in the fundamental amplitudes, hence laws, that apply to each mandala. (I concede it may be necessary to have a means to encode in each manadala the given fundamental amplitudes that apply to that manadala.)
Now consider how amplitudes propagate in each mandala from an initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">amplitudes</ENAMEX> concentrated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma- tetrahedron</ENAMEX>. And consider any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mandalas</ENAMEX> whose fundamental amplitudes are minimally dierent. For some such adjacent mandalas with adjacent laws, the small change in the law may lead to a large change in how amplitudes propagate in the mandalas. For other pairs with minimal changes in the fundamental amplitudes or law, the way the amplitude propagates throughout the mandala may be very slight. Assuming this is true, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> intuitively imagines that the total system is spontaneously drawn to those tuned values of the fundamental amplitude laws, where small changes in the laws make minimal changes in how amplitudes propagate.
A simple possible mechanism might accomplish this. Imagine a sum of histories from an initial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma- tetrahedron</ENAMEX> in a mandala with some given fundamental amplitude laws (thereby the initial and boundary conditions are specified), where the pathways in that set of histories pass up and down the stack of mandalas such that the fundamental amplitude laws change, as does the spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, and then consider the bundle of all such histories that end on a given spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> with given, perhaps new, fundamental amplitude laws. In eect, this conceptual move allows there to be quantum uncertainty not only with respect to spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> along histories, but also quantum uncertainty with respect to the law by which amplitude propagates.
Then one can imagine a sum over all histories that, by constructive interference alone, picks those pathways, hence fundamental amplitude laws, that minimize the change in the ways amplitudes propagate. Such pathways would have similar phase, hence, accumulate amplitude by constructive interference. Then, by mere constructive interference, one can hope that such a process would pick out not only the history, but also tune the law to the well-chosen fundamental amplitudes laws that maximized constructive interference. Hopefully, that constructive interference would pick out smooth large-scale geometries like classical flat or near flat space. In such a large-scale classical-like space and time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚Äôs</ENAMEX> familiar sum over histories that minimizes a least action along classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trajectories</ENAMEX> would emerge as a consequence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smolin</ENAMEX> and I discuss this possibility in a second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. I find the idea attractive as a research program because it oers a way in which a known process, constructive interference, modified to act over a space of geometries and laws simultaneously, chooses the law. It is, of course, rather radical to suppose that there is quantum uncertainty in the law, but it does not seem obviously impossible.
On an even grander scale, particle physicists build the standard model from an abstract algebra called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SU</ENAMEX>() <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x SU</ENAMEX>() x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>(). One can imagine a similar research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> that by constructive interference alone picks out the particles, constants, and laws of the standard model. Presumably, particles governed by suciently ‚Äúnearby‚Äù laws would be able to interact, hence undergo constructive or destructive interference, thus picking the particles and the laws simultaneously.
There is a further interesting feature, for we appear to have in our mandala, or mandalas, a new arrow of time. Allow that at any step, any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachner</ENAMEX> move can happen. Some moves add tetrahedra. A equal number delete tetrahedra. Yet the number of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in ring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> + is larger than the number of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in ring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Statistically</ENAMEX>, there are more ways to advance into ring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> + than to retreat from ring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> into ring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">N -</ENAMEX> . Other things equal, amplitude should tend to propagate outward from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma- tetrahedron</ENAMEX>. There is an analogy in chemical reaction graphs to the adjacent possible and the real chemical potential across the frontier from the actual to the adjacent possible.
But if so, time enters asymmetrically due to the graph structure of the spin network mandala. Then, statistically, time tends to flow in one direction, from simpler toward more complex spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">ever-expanding</ENAMEX> adjacent possible.
A Brief Comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">String</ENAMEX> Theory
String theory has gained very substantial attention as a potential ‚Äútheory of everything,‚Äù namely, a theory that might link <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and all the particles of the standard model into a single coherent framework. I do not write with even modest expertise on the subject. Nevertheless, it is possible that the concept of the law selecting itself via maximum constructive interference in a sum over all possible histories in a space of both spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and laws might possibly have relevance to string theory. The description of string theory that I give draws heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Greene‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Elegant Universe</ENAMEX>.
As is known qualitatively by many outside the confines of the physics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, string theory began by giving up the picture of fundamental particles as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>-dimensional, point particles. In its initial version, in the place of point particles, string theory posited one-dimensional strings that might be open, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ends, or closed loops, with no free ends. Among the fundamental ideas of string theory is the idea that the dierent particles and the dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> can all be thought of as dierent modes of vibration of such strings. Because strings have finite length, string theory can hope to overcome the infinities that emerge when attempts are made to marry point particle quantum theories with general relativity in a continuous space-time. In eect, the finite length of the strings prevents consideration of space becoming infinitely curved at a point. Thus, string theory can dream of uniting quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> and general relativity, and it has, in fact, produced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> carrying the gravitational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, the graviton, in a natural way.
Current string theory has gone beyond single-dimensional strings, and now considers two-or-higher-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-</ENAMEX>branes. The rough present state of the art has shown that there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least five one-dimensional</TIMEX> string theories and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-</ENAMEX>brane theory. All of these theories appear to be linked as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX> of one another via various dualities among the theories.
String theories posit either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>-or-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer</NUMEX>-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> and time, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the spatial dimensions unfurled and large scale, corresponding to our familiar three-dimensional space. The remaining dimensions are imagined as curled up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck</ENAMEX> length scale in what are called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúCalabi-Yau‚</ENAMEX>Äù spaces, or more generally, compactified moduli. Compactification of an eleven-dimensional space and time can be thought of as a large-scale three-dimensional space and time, but with the additional dimensions curled up at each point in the large-scale three-dimensional space.
Calabi-Yau spaces can have dierent topologies. Consider as an analogy a long thin tube with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-hole torus, like a donut. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are topologically dierent. As a consequence, closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-dimensional</TIMEX> string loops can ‚Äúlive‚Äù on these surfaces in dierent ways. Thus, if you think of a string as a closed loop, that loop might live on the long tube in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways, either wrapped around the tube <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> times or not wrapped around the tube, but lying on the tube‚Äôs surface like a rubber band lying on a surface. By contrast, consider the torus. The closed string might wrap around the torus in either of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways, through the hole or around the torus. In addition, the string loop might live on the surface of the torus without wrapping either dimension. Each of these dierent ways of being on the tube or torus and the corresponding modes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vibration</ENAMEX> constitute dierent particles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. Calabi-Yau spaces are more complex than the tube or torus, but the basic consequences are the same. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dierent Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces, or more generally, dierent compactified moduli, with dierent kinds of holes around which strings can wrap <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, one, or more times correspond to dierent laws of physics with dierent particles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>.
Physicists have shown, furthermore, that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space can smoothly deform into another with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgentle‚Äù tearing</ENAMEX> of space and time. Hence, the laws, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, and particles can deform into one another in a space of laws, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, and particles. Within current string theory, it appears that it is still not certain that there exists a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space whose string or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-brane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> would actually correspond to the known particles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, but hopes are high.
However, even if there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space whose strings and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M-</ENAMEX>branes do correspond to our known particles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, string <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> have the diculty that it is not clear how the current universe happens to choose the correct <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space. The familiar ideas on this subject include the existence of a multiverse and the weak anthropic principle. For example, one could imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Smolin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs arguments for choices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces that lead to fecund universes with a near maximum of black holes, which are the birthplaces of still further universes.
The parallel between spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with dierent fundamental amplitude laws and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of string and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-brane</ENAMEX> theories that can deform into one another is that in both theories we confront a family of theories having the property that dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the family correspond to dierent particles, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, and laws. In both cases, physicists do not at present have a theory to account for how, in this embarrassment of riches, our universe happens to pick the correct laws. I therefore make the suggestion that the same pattern of reasoning that I described above, a sum over histories of trajectories that vary both in configurations and in the laws, which maximizes constructive interference, might prove a useful approach. In the string theory context, one would consider a hyperspace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces, in which neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces would propagate amplitudes from the same initial condition in dierent ways. Presumably, somewhere in the hyperspace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces, small changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces would yield small changes in how amplitudes propagate. For other locations in the hyperspace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces, small changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space would yield large dierences in how amplitudes propagate. In the hyperspace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space can deform into its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, it should be possible to construct a sum over all histories of trajectories between an initial and final <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the same or dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space, then seek such sums over histories that maximize constructive interference. The hope is that maximizing constructive interferences would pick out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space corresponding to our particles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. Presumably, this would occur in the region of the hyperspace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> spaces, where small changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Calabi-Yau</ENAMEX> space yield the smallest changes in how amplitudes propagate. In short, maximization of constructive interference may be a useful principle to consider to understand how the universe chooses its laws.
String <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorists</ENAMEX> recognize the need to confront further major problems. Most notably, string theory posits a background space-time in which strings and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-branes</ENAMEX> vibrate. But if string theory is to be the theory of everything, including space and time, then space and time cannot be assumed as a backdrop. Thus, a virtue of spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> is that it aords the hope of a quantized geometry from the outset. On the other hand, particles and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nongravitational forces have yet to be incorporated into a spin network picture.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decoherence Spin Network Approach</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum Gravity</ENAMEX>
However the universe picks its presumably quantum laws, somehow the classical realm emerges. I noted above that current theory sees <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches to linking the quantum and classical realms. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feynman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sum over histories, but as a perturbative theory assumes a continuous background space-time and does not get rid of the linear superposition of possibilities that is the core of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> and interference.
What of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> approach, decoherence? The reality of decoherence is established. If one is to take decoherence seriously, and also to consider geometry constructing itself, then presumably decoherence can apply to geometry as it constructs itself. What would it mean to apply decoherence to quantum gravity itself, to the vacuum, to geometry itself?
Well, to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>, the following seems possible. If we are to conceive of an initial spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, say a tetrahedron, and all possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, as well as all their possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, propagating amplitudes on the mandala, then at any moment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> steps away from moment , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> geometry is possible¬†¬†namely all those reachable in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N Pachner</ENAMEX> moves.
We seem to confront the same problem we confront with quantum systems coupling to quantum systems, such as electrons coupling to organic molecules, or to classical systems, such as rocks. These quantum systems can decohere. Can quantum geometries become coupled with one another or dierent parts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> quantum geometry become coupled, so to speak, and decohere?
Why not try the idea?
I now discuss <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible approach to this issue. The approach posits a quantum of action, h, to the generation of a tetrahedron, hence a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck</ENAMEX> energy and thus a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck</ENAMEX> mass to a tetrahedron, and decoherence setting in at a sucient mass and size scale.
By use of an equation suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zurek</ENAMEX> relating the decoherence timescale, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Td</ENAMEX>, to the relaxation timescale, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tr</ENAMEX>, of the system, in which increasing mass and area increase the rate of decoherence in proportion to their product, it can be qualitatively shown (via suciently rough arguments) that geometry may well be thought of as decohering, and doing so on a length scale of about cm, which is smaller than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Compton</ENAMEX> radius of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> and even smaller than the radius of a nucleus.
Now, there are some interesting features of this rough calculation. First, if we begin with an initial tetrahedron of geometry, it can have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> tetrahedra. In turn, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter tetrahedron</ENAMEX> can have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> tetrahedra, hence, the initial spin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> can grow exponentially in the number of tetrahedra before decoherence sets in. This is a clue that a purely quantum account might be given of an initial exponential expansion of a universe starting with a single tetrahedron. Thus, it might be possible to do without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúinflationary hypothesis‚Äù</ENAMEX> of exponential expansion of a classical space in the early <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">moments</TIMEX> after the big bang.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, an initial exponential expansion of geometry might overcome, as the inflationary hypothesis does, the particle-horizon problem in cosmology, in which we confront the puzzle of why parts of the universe that have been out of apparent causal contact since the big bang can be so similar. If the initial expansion is exponential, then slows to linear, as in the inflationary hypothesis or perhaps in this purely quantum approach, then the particle-horizon problem may disappear.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, a purely quantum exponential expansion over many orders of magnitude should presumably yield a flat power spectrum over many size scales for quantum fluctuations in the earliest small fraction of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of the life of the universe prior to the end of this exponential expansion when decoherence of geometry occurs.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, we must consider when geometries decohere whether there may be geometries that are the slowest to decohere. If dierent parts of a single spin network geometry can become coupled, it is natural to assume that flat parts might decohere more slowly than distorted parts of that geometry. Intuitively, phase information can get lost more readily when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lumpy parts of a geometry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> than when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> flat parts of a geometry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX>. Of course, an explicit model exploring this is badly needed and entirely missing, but in its absence, let‚Äôs make the assumption. Given that, then an initial exponential explosion of flat and warped geometry occurs until decoherence sets in on a length scale of something like cm. At this point, flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">geometry ‚Äúwins‚Äù</ENAMEX> because it decoheres most slowly. Hence, as soon as decoherence of geometry sets in, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> tends to be flat in the absence of matter.
But even after decoherence sets in, geometry is busy all the time trying to build geometry exponentially and everywhere, while simultaneously decohering. Now an interesting feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Td/Tr</ENAMEX> equation alluded to above is that whatever the exponential rate of expansion of geometry may be per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck time</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, the exponential rate of decoherence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Td</ENAMEX>, which grows as the mass times the size scale squared of the geometry, increases, until eventually the exponential rate of formation and exponential rate of decoherence of geometry must balance. The exponential expansion of the universe is over. However, linear expansion by construction of geometry can continue. The fastest linear construction of geometry from any tetrahedron would be at the speed of light.
When the rate of geometry formation and decoherence balance, geometry keeps building tetrahedra as fast as possible everywhere, but flat geometry, by hypothesis, decoheres most slowly. In the limit, perhaps flat geometries do not decohere at all. Then, the geometry of the universe tends to be flat in the absence of matter, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX> requires in general relativity. And, once again, the flatness after exponential expansion may overcome a need for the inflationary scenario and solve the particle-horizon problem.
It may be of interest that the assumption of an action, h, in the generation of each tetrahedron implies an expanding total energy in geometry itself, the vacuum itself, as geometry constructs itself. Indeed, one expects that the assumption of an action, h, per tetrahedron would lead to a uniform energy density, a constant scalar quantity even as geometry grows. Such an energy could be related to the cosmological constant.
It may also be of interest that string theory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">posits ‚Äúextra dimensions‚Äù</ENAMEX> that ‚Äúcurl up‚Äù on themselves to yield four-dimensional space-time. Could the decoherence of geometry aord a parallel way that extra dimensions can curl up? And could the ever-generating possible geometries, as they generate exponentially even as they decohere, yield sucient extra degrees of freedom to correspond to the modes of oscillation of strings or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-branes</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or seven</NUMEX> extra dimensions?
It may be interesting that the energy content of geometry could be enormous compared to that of familiar particles of the same size scale. That might allow the familiar particles with rest mass to borrow a tiny bit of the vacuum energy for their mass. Such a possibility could hint that matter, energy, and geometry might be able to interconvert. Perhaps dierent particles would be dierent kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">topological ‚Äúknots‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the spin network structure of geometry with interconvertible particles being nearby knot topologies.
We are obviously far from anything like a coherent theory that implements any of the intuitions above. They remain at best mere suggestions for a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coconstructing Complexity</ENAMEX>?
I began this chapter wondering why the universe is complex. In place of the anthropic principle or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Smolin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cosmic selection, I have suggested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible approach to the choices of the constants of nature by maximizing constructive interference over a sum of all histories through a space of both configurations and laws. Even if that program were to succeed, it does not necessarily yield a complex universe, let alone one poised roughly between expansion and contraction.
Might we see ways to understand why the universe is complex? Perhaps, but merely perhaps. I return to the thoughts earlier in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> that decoherence requires coupling systems and the loss of phase information. If, in general, complex and high-diversity quantum systems with many coupled degrees of freedom lose phase information when they interact more rapidly than an equal number of simple, low-diversity quantum systems with the same total number of interacting parts, then the comeasuring of entangled quantum systems should tend toward higher complexity, diversity, and classicity. In short, complexity and diversity would beget classicity irreversibly. In turn, this would lead to a preferred tendency toward a lock-in of complexity and diversity. There is a sense in which classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> are like the constraints on the release of energy that permits work to be done. Classical objects, interacting with quantum objects, lead to decoherence and more classicity. Complex pairs of quantum objects that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decohere</ENAMEX> readily, or classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and those quantum objects that are caused to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decohere</ENAMEX> readily when interacting with the classical object, form preferred pairs that tend to decohere, hence become frozen into classicity. We begin to have an image of preferred pairs of quantum systems coupling and decohering, hence, an image of a complex and diverse universe constructing itself as it nonergodically invades the adjacent possible, rather as a biosphere constructs itself. And if more complexity and diversity means more comeasurement and faster decoherence of a wider variety of complex quantum systems, in analogy with the concept that extracting work from increasingly subtle nonequilibrium systems requires increasingly subtle measuring and coupling devices, the universe as a whole may persistently break symmetries as new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> come into existence, and hence expand its diversity, complexity, and classicity as fast as possible.
Loose arguments? Yes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Testable</ENAMEX>? Here and there. Wrong? Probably. Deeply wrong? Maybe not. Does this get the universe to the edge of expansion versus contraction or to a flat universe expanding forever more rapidly? I would love it to be so. Indeed, I would love a view in which matter, energy, and geometry can all interconvert. After all, if geometry, the vacuum, has energy, such interconversion does not seem impossible. Do the considerations of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> require detailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and supporting calculations to be taken as more than the merest suggestions? Absolutely. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, like much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investigations</ENAMEX>, is protoscience. But science grows from serious protoscience, and I take Investigations to be serious protoscience.
We enter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a new millennium</TIMEX>. There will be time for new science to grow.
