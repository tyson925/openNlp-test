A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physics of Semantics</ENAMEX>?
ach of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> of Investigations broaches new territory. Each is tentative and incomplete, pointing but not fully adequate. Yet, I persistently hope, it is better to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">light one candle</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">againstÂ Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â what</ENAMEX>? the darkness? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before? There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several centuries</TIMEX>, to doubt a physics of semantics. We are on shaky ground. Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>, long-legged, knowing how <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> is thin, when the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase transition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found.
We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, able to manipulate the universe on its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">behalfÂ Â the egret</ENAMEX> whose foreboding of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> leads to lifted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> and steady, powerful flight. The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom, and perhaps more than the vaunted quark. But autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, we who do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œintentionalityâ€</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œpurposeâ€</ENAMEX> are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of processes and properties. If the concept of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were something like a usefulÂ Â or more, a properÂ Â definition of life itself, then autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where â€œpurposeâ€ is ascribed by all of us to one another.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semantics</ENAMEX> enters with purpose. For this to be true, it is not necessary that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> of purpose, say, the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> heading upstream in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX>, be conscious.
I hope my definition of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is useful, an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle, now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work, then do extract work, propagating work and constraint construction, from their environment.
Know-how
Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now, plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crustal material</ENAMEX>.
I want to say that the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> comprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> had, individually and collectively, the embodied know-how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world. Indeed, as I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and their search procedures became the kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œjobsâ€</ENAMEX> that were widely filled, the abundant niches of the bio-sphere. There is in this whole self-constructing system a wider know-how, beyond the know-how of any single autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> spinning eagerly in its microenvironment. Yet, clearly, the know-how is distributed. There is no autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.
What in the world is â€œknow-howâ€? Philosophers distinguish between â€œknow-howâ€ and â€œknow that.â€ I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums. â€œKnow thatâ€ concerns propositions, most conveniently, human propositions. I know that the moon <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">isÂ Â they tell meÂ Â not</ENAMEX> made of green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>. I know that the earth circles the sun, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly spherical</NUMEX>, that chairs are used to sit on. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œKnow thatâ€</ENAMEX> brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the world. Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can â€œknow thatâ€ with respect to propositions.
Unlike â€œknow that,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€ â€œknow-howâ€</ENAMEX> does not involve propositions about the world. â€œKnow-howâ€ involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cheetah streaking</ENAMEX> after the wildebeest, the athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> high jumping, have the know-how to do it.
Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world? I certainly want to say yes, without attributing consciousness in any way. Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metabolic</ENAMEX> switching, mechanical twitching, sensing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX>, swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations. It knows how all right, even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business. But then, try to talk about tying your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> or the skilled driving when you become aware some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of miles down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention.
Thank God for know-how. Know that is a thin veneer on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a four-billion-year-old</TIMEX> know-how skill abundant in the biosphere. But any autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> proliferating alone or in a congery of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how. If we synthesize autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decades</TIMEX> and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.
The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. The know-how is not outside that propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The know-how is the propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
Semantics
All of which brings us, inevitably, to the brink of semantics.
It is simple at its roots, you see. An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> really is (i) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) poison; (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) a signal; (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) neutral; (v) something else. 
Once there is an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view. The incoming molecule is â€œyuckâ€ or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œyum.â€ I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. And I think we have roughly the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> criteria in mind. If yum, then there will probably be more of this type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, osprings of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. If yuck, it is not so likely this lineage will prosper.
Once yuck and yum, we are not far from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. S. Pierceâ</ENAMEX>€™s meaning-laden semiotic triad: sign, signified, significans. Like it or not, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX> is a sign, a predictor, of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œmore glucose</ENAMEX> that way.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Granted</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> is not an arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>. In this restricted sense, signs are causally correlated with that which is signified. By contrast, the relation between the word â€œchairâ€ and that which it signifies, and on which I am now sitting, is arbitrary. But can chemical signals in bacterial and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view? If so, can â€œmere chemicalsâ€ be signs in the full <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Piercean</ENAMEX> sense?
I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words. Consider first the famous genetic code. Triplets of nucleotides in an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecule stand for specific amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> that will end up incorporated into a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The detailed causal machinery involves transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> are attached, the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> binding site of each transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> with the proper amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> among the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, the binding of the charged transfer RNAâ€™s anticodon site to the proper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> code word triplet, the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules and links the successive amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> into the growing polypeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> that hangs free in the cytoplasm, tethered by the ribosome to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">messenger RNA</ENAMEX> molecule as it is â€œtranslated.â€
The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules, which translate a given messenger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> code word triplet into a dierent amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Monod</ENAMEX> properly emphasized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades ago</TIMEX> in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site, the relation of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> that undergo the catalysis. The same is true of the transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> where the anticodon site is distant from the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> binding site. Because of this, which amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> is charged onto a particular transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging, plus the structure of the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> binding site on the transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon-codon matching mechanism. In short, chemistry allows arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> of control relations.
It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign, signified, and significans to the genetic code. It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling, chemical and otherwise, within and between autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, as exemplified by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> that â€œwarnsâ€ other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites.
The calculus that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Shannonâ</ENAMEX>€™s elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols. Nowhere in the core of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shannonâ</ENAMEX>€™s work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning, or semantics, of the information enter. This is no criticism, and is widely known and appreciated. There is, however, just a hint of semantics in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shannonâ</ENAMEX>€™s view that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">semantics</ENAMEX> resides in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œdecoder</ENAMEX>.â€
I cannot buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shannonâ</ENAMEX>€™s view unless the decoder is an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. If not, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">decoder</ENAMEX> merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsÂ Â perhaps a set of water-filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways. The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding.
But if the recipient is an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics. If only the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> could tell us: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œDid you see that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> of a paramecium coming at me? Iâ€™ve run into that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> before! I ducked under a boulder, and he never sensed me. I made it home. Pass me some more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> please, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX>.â€
I will return in the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> to discuss such stories, for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and, therefore, cannot deduce that which will unfold. Thus, among other things, we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in their worlds. Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing. I too know the risks, including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œintentional talkâ€ to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question. But patience. Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold, but we also cannot even translateÂ Â in the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsÂ Â from legal talk to normal intentional talk, let alone from legal talk of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henderson</ENAMEX> found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound-wave forms monitored and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX> at space-time lines as a description.
Then letâ€™s just be naive for the moment. The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">agentÂ Â say</ENAMEX>, an early bacteriumÂ Â is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world. The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered, context-dependent set of causal implications of the event, or signal, in question.
â€œFor want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> was lost; and for want of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, the rider was lost,â€ more or less, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamin Franklin</ENAMEX>. The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in the coevolving system.
It seems hard to ascribe purpose, in the sense of acting on its own behalf, to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga. Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> is purely tautological. After all, I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX> was acting on its own behalf in an environment, defined an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> as a physical system able to act on its own behalf, then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf. Now, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of matter, energy, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf. My definition is a definitional circle.
On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F = MA and Darwinâ€™s â€œnatural selectionâ€ and â€œfitness</ENAMEX>,â€ that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Stones</ENAMEX> and chairs are not, by my definition, autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. All living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are. And the stunning fact directly before us, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, is that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> do manipulate the world on their own behalf. Watch a pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nesting birds</ENAMEX> build their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX>.
In short, once we have autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.
Knowing
What about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œknowingâ€</ENAMEX>?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Dennett</ENAMEX>, in his fine book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Darwinâ€™s Dangerous Idea</ENAMEX>, advances a hierarchy of forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œknowing,â€</ENAMEX> if I may use that term, that have arisen in evolution by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> means. I find his hierarchy congenial and informative. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Dennett</ENAMEX> envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher-order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> via variation and natural selection.
I do not disagree, although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution. Here, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Investigations</ENAMEX>, I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hopefulness</ENAMEX> in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy, detect those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of energy, create devices and processes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of energy, and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further. I wonder, in short, at the naturalness and self-generaticity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dennettâ</ENAMEX>€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cranes building cranes building cranes</ENAMEX> in biospheres, perhaps planetary geologies, and beyond.
But back to the past. Dennett <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">distinguishes â€œDarwinian creatures</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â€œPavlovian creatures</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â€œPopperian creatures</ENAMEX>,â€ and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œGregorian creatures</ENAMEX>.â€ A simple autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, say, a bacterium, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>. In its simplest version, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> evolves by mutation, also recombination and natural selection. For the moment, no behavioral learning is to be considered. So <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (or a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an ecosystem</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> adapts more or less as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> told us.
At the next level up, say, aplysia, a nervous system is present, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> is capable of stimulus-response learning, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ã  la Pavlov</ENAMEX>. Indeed, aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimuliÂ Â the later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œexpectationâ€</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
At the next level (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dennett</ENAMEX>, perhaps properly, reserves this for us vertebrates) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Popperian creature</ENAMEX>. Popperian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dennettâ</ENAMEX>€™s fine phrase, have â€œinternal modelsâ€ of their world and can â€œrun the internal modelâ€ with the clutch disengaged, rather than running the model in real time in the real world. This allows us lucky <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Popperian creatures</ENAMEX> to allow our â€œhypotheses to die in our stead.â€ I love that image.
Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popperian</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gregorian creatureÂ Â namely</ENAMEX>, at least <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dennett</ENAMEX> makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toolsÂ Â literally stone knives</ENAMEX>, arrows, digging sticks, machine toolsÂ Â to enlarge our shared world of facts and processes. This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how, and more know that. Cultural evolution, at some point, begins to burst out-of-bounds. Hard rock music jangles the minarets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom? <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> cooking lands in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX> is invented. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whatâ€™s</ENAMEX> next under the sun? Who can say?
I very much like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennettâ</ENAMEX>€™s ladder of know-how, and eventual know that. Without invoking consciousness, not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject, it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems, even without evoking nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>.
I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">realizations</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and amoebae do have a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pavlovian</ENAMEX> learning already, for they have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level. This is not yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter. As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus, why not envision a complex chemistry, say, very complex carbohydrate-synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves, which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism. Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self-sustaining web linking the carbohydrates, the enzymes, and certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein receptors</ENAMEX> mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus, then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops. The image is not too far from how it is imagined that â€œidiotypeâ€ and â€œanti-idiotypeâ€ immune <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen. In such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, for which there is modestly good evidence, a given first <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> serves as an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> that stimulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to produce a second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> that binds to the unique amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œidiotypeâ€</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. In turn, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> â€œanti-idiotypeâ€ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> stimulates a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, which stimulates a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>. But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> can often both bind to the same site on the second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, hence, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> antibodies are similar shapes in shape space. It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system.
Popperian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>? Why cannot the molecular-sensing and hypothesis-testing churning concerns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> as it senses a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">paramecium churn twenty cycles</ENAMEX> before kicking in the rotary motor, or not, such that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wee bacterium hides</ENAMEX> under a boulder of a grain of sand until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> passes by? Are nerves necessary? <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX>, as noted, are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> infesting the glade. There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect, just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified. Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates.
I do get stuck at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gregorian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>. Even here, the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language, wherever new sentences can be created, is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole. If the conversation we recent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another.
I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere, with its urgent diversity in which, emboldened by all our know-how, we do get on with a very rich conversation, may very early already have harbored all the levels of which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennett</ENAMEX> speaks. We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> are just more gregarious with our vocal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cords</ENAMEX> and e-mail, I guess. Smart place, a biosphere, lots to talk about. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four billion years</TIMEX> of yammering. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slapstick</ENAMEX> comedy may have started a long time ago.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics</ENAMEX>
And what of ethics? Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuck</ENAMEX> or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. There are deep reasons for caution. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hume</ENAMEX> told us long ago about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œnaturalistic fallacyâ€</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One cannot deduce â€œoughtâ€</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œis.â€ From the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hume</ENAMEX> argued. From the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> set out to conquer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and more and to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jewry</ENAMEX>, we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so.
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humeâ</ENAMEX>€™s injunction underlies the caution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> about making ethical statements. We <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> find the facts. You <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> across the globe can argue the ethics. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hume</ENAMEX> warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all? Humeâ€™s injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category â€œought.â€
The eorts following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hume</ENAMEX> to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous. Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna Circle</ENAMEX> that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> as famous as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. E. Moore</ENAMEX> came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances. â€œIt is wrong to kill.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€ Becomes, â€œAgggah!â</ENAMEX>€ Does the positivist argument seem persuasive? It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, â€œonly those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful,â€ is itself not empirically verifiable. One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards. 
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rawls</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all â€œcontractuallyâ€ agree to, were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments. Thus â€œequality before the lawâ€ is one contract that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rawls</ENAMEX> commends to us. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€œEquality</ENAMEX> before the lawâ€ is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>. The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue.
I will content myself with wondering where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œvalueâ€</ENAMEX> and the rudiments of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œintentionalityâ€</ENAMEX> come from in the physical universe in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place and leave social contracts for other eorts. Where is the place of value in a world of fact? 
So, a short soliloquy. Facts are know-that statements. But know-how preceded know that. While fully aware of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humeâ</ENAMEX>€™s injunction, I think that from the autonomous agentâ€™s perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. I suppose we apply the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> criteria. Too much yuck, this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere. Without attributing consciousness to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, or an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are around.
And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is around is the rudiment of intentionality present? If so, another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid. Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible. You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control. To act ethically, you must first be able to act at all.
But what are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œactsâ€</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Yamins</ENAMEX> is a brilliant young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematician</ENAMEX>. Now entering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a summer</TIMEX> with me at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX> before he learned to drive, after an earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> spent in the laboratory of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Szostak</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, where, at age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> was learning to evolve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> molecules to bind arbitrary ligands. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> and I struggled that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> to make the distinction between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œdoingsâ€</ENAMEX> of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and mere happenings in and around the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Note we say the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> is swimming upstream in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX> to get dinner. But all sorts of molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vibrational</ENAMEX>, rotational, and translational motions are occurring. What are actions and what are mere happenings?
I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics. But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danâ</ENAMEX>€™s happy phrasing, is relevant for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>, us, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in general. We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> and the other causal consequences of that part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> but not otherwise? Granted that we here seem to confront the language game <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circularity</ENAMEX> alluded to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics, intentionality, value, and ethics arise with autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Humeâ€™s naturalistic fallacy</ENAMEX>. We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
