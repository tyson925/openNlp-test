<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prolegomenon</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Biology</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecturing</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">twentieth century‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous physicists set the stage of contemporary biology during the war-heavy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year of 1944</TIMEX>. Given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erwin Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs towering reputation as the discoverer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> equation, the fundamental formulation of quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, his public lectures and subsequent book were bound to draw high attention. But no one, not even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> himself, was likely to have foreseen the consequences. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs What Is Life</ENAMEX>? is credited with inspiring a generation of physicists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> to seek the fundamental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of living systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> brought quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, chemistry, and the still poorly formulated concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúinformation‚Äù</ENAMEX> into biology. He is the progenitor of our understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and the genetic code. Yet as brilliant as was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs insight</ENAMEX>, I believe he missed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Investigations seeks that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and finds, in fact, a mystery.
In my previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> books, I laid out some of the growing reasons to think that evolution was even richer than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> supposed. Modern evolutionary theory, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs concept of descent with heritable variations that are sifted by natural selection to retain the adaptive changes, has come to view selection as the sole source of order in biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. But the snowflake‚Äôs delicate sixfold symmetry tells us that order can arise without the benefit of natural selection. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe</ENAMEX> give good grounds to think that much of the order in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, from the origin of life itself to the stunning order in the development of a newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> from a fertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>, does not reflect selection alone. Instead, much of the order in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, I believe, is self-organized and spontaneous. Self-organization <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mingles</ENAMEX> with natural selection in barely understood ways to yield the magnificence of our teeming biosphere. We must, therefore, expand evolutionary theory.
Yet we need something far more important than a broadened evolutionary theory. Despite any valid insights in my own <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> books, and despite the fine work of many others, including the brilliance manifest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades</TIMEX> of molecular biology, the core of life itself remains shrouded from view. We know chunks of molecular machinery, metabolic pathways, means of membrane biosynthesis¬†=¬†we know many of the parts and many of the processes. But what makes a cell alive is still not clear to us. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is still mysterious.
And so I began my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">notebook ‚ÄúInvestigations‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December of 1994</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full half century</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs What Is Life?</ENAMEX>, as an intellectual enterprise unlike any I had undertaken before. Rather bravely and thinking with some presumptuousness of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wittgenstein‚Äôs famous Philosophical Investigations</ENAMEX>, which had shattered the philosophical tradition of logical atomism in which he had richly participated, I betook myself to my oYce at home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> and grandly intoned through my fingers onto the computer‚Äôs disc, ‚ÄúInvestigations,‚Äù on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 4, 1994</TIMEX>. I sensed my long search would uncover issues that were then only dimly visible to me. I hoped the unfolding, ongoing notebook would allow me to find the themes and link them into something that was vast and new but at the time inarticulate.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September of 1996</TIMEX>, I published a modestly well-organized version of Investigations as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX> preprint, launched it onto the web, and put it aside for the time being. I found I had indeed been led into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">arenas</ENAMEX> that I had in no way expected, led by a swirl of ever new questions. I put the notebooks aside, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX> I returned to the swirl, taking up again a struggle to see something that, I think, is right in front of us¬†=¬†always the hardest thing to see. This book is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> of these eVorts. And this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> is but an introduction, in brief, to the themes that will be explained more fully in the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>. I would ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with unfamiliar terms and concepts.
My first eVorts had begun with twin questions. First, in addition to the known laws of thermodynamics, could there possibly be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics for open thermodynamic systems, some law that governs biospheres anywhere in the cosmos or the cosmos itself? <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">entities¬†=¬†bacteria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and animals¬†=¬†manipulate the world on their own behalf: the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> swimming upstream in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX> that is easily said to be going to get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúdinner‚Äù</ENAMEX>; the paramecium, cilia beating like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> warship‚Äôs oars, hot after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>; we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> earning our livings. Call the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, paramecium, and us <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> ‚Äúautonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>,‚Äù able to act on our own behalf in an environment.
My <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and core question became, What must a physical system be to be an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>? Make no mistake, we autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> mutually construct our biosphere, even as we coevolve in it. Why and how this is so is a central subject of all that follows.
From the outset, there were, and remain, reasons for deep skepticism about the enterprise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investigations</ENAMEX>. First, there are very strong arguments to say that there can be no general law for open thermodynamic systems. The core argument is simple to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Any computer program is an algorithm that, given data, produces some sequence of output, finite or infinite. Computer programs can always be written in the form of a binary symbol string of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 0</NUMEX> symbols. All possible binary symbol strings are possible computer programs. Hence, there is a countable, or denumerable, infinity of computer programs. A theorem states that for most computer programs, there is no compact description of the printout of the program. Rather, we must just unleash the program and watch it print what it prints. In short, there is no shorter description of the output of the program than that which can be obtained by running the program itself. If by the concept of a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù we mean a compact description, ahead of time, of what the computer program will print then for any such program, there can be no law that allows us to predict what the program will actually do ahead of the actual running of the program.
The next step is simple. Any such program can be realized on a universal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turing</ENAMEX> machine such as the familiar computer. But that computer is an open nonequilibrium thermodynamic system, its openness visibly realized by the plug and power line that connects the computer to the electric power grid. Therefore, and I think this conclusion is cogent, there can be no general law for all possible nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems.
So why was I conjuring the possibility of a general law for open thermodynamic systems? Clearly, no such general law can hold for all open thermodynamic systems.
But hold a moment. It is we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> who conceived and built the intricate assembly of chips and logic gates that constitute a computer, typically we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> who program it, and we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> who contrived the entire power grid that supplies the electric power to run the computer itself. This assemblage of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-twentieth-century</TIMEX> technology did not assemble itself. We built it.
On the other hand, no one designed and built the biosphere. The biosphere got itself constructed by the emergence and persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coevolution</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. If there cannot be general laws for all open thermodynamic systems, might there be general laws for thermodynamically open but self-constructing systems such as biospheres? I believe that the answer is yes. Indeed, among those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> laws to be discussed in this book is a candidate <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics for such self-constructing systems.
To roughly state the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> law, I suspect that biospheres maximize the average secular construction of the diversity of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and the ways those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> can make a living to propagate further. In other words, on average, bio-spheres persistently increase the diversity of what can happen next. In eVect, as we shall see later, biospheres may maximize the average sustained growth of their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdimensionality</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Thus, the enterprise of Investigations soon began to center on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> whose coevolution constructs a biosphere. I was gradually led to a labyrinth of issues concerning the core features of autonomous agents able to manipulate the world on their own behalf. It may be that those core features capture a proper definition of life and that definition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diVers</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> found.
To state my hypothesis abruptly and without preamble, I think an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is a self-reproducing system able to perform <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> thermodynamic work cycle. It will require most of this book to unfold the implications of this tentative definition.
Following an eVort to understand what an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> might be¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†=¬†which</ENAMEX>, as just noted, involves the concept of work cycles¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†=¬†I</ENAMEX> was led to the concepts of work itself, constraints, and work as the constrained release of energy. In turn, this led to the fact that work itself is often used to construct constraints on the release of energy that then constitutes further work. So we confront a virtuous cycle: Work constructs constraints, yet constraints on the release of energy are required for work to be done. Here is the heart of a new concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúorganization‚Äù</ENAMEX> that is not covered by our concepts of matter alone, energy alone, entropy alone, or information alone. In turn, this led me to wonder about the relation between the emergence of constraints in the universe and in a biosphere, and the diversification of patterns of the constrained release of energy that alone constitute work and the use of that work to build still further constraints on the release of energy. How do <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biospheres</ENAMEX> construct themselves or how does the universe construct itself?
The considerations above led to the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell‚</ENAMEX>Äôs demon, one of the major places in physics where matter, energy, work, and information come together. The central point of the demon is that by making measurements on a system, the information gained can be used to extract work. I made a new distinction between measurements the demon might make that reveal features of nonequilibrium systems that can be used to extract work, and measurements he might make of the nonequilibrium system that cannot be used to extract work. How does the demon know what features to measure? And, in turn, how does work actually come to be extracted by devices that measure and detect displacements from equilibrium from which work can, in principle, be obtained? An example of such a device is a windmill pivoting to face the wind, then extracting work by the wind turning its vanes. Other examples are the rhodopsin molecule of a bacterium responding to a photon of light or a chloroplast using the constrained release of the energy of light to construct high-energy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> molecules. How do such devices come into existence in the unfolding universe and in our biosphere? How does the vast web of constraint construction and constrained energy release used to construct yet more constraints happen into existence in the biosphere? In the universe itself? The answers appear not to be present in contemporary physics, chemistry, or biology. But a coevolving biosphere accomplishes just this coconstruction of propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
Thus, in due course, I struggled with the concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> itself, concluding that our concepts of entropy and its negative, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shannon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs information theory (which was developed initially to quantify telephonic traYc and had been greatly extended since then) entirely miss the central issues. What is happening in a biosphere is that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are coconstructing and propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> of work, of constraint construction, and of task completion that continue to propagate and proliferate diversifying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
This statement is just plain true. Look out your window, burrow down a foot or so, and try to establish what all the microscopic life is busy doing and building and has done for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, let alone the macroscopic ecosystem of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, herbivores, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carnivores</ENAMEX> that is slipping, sliding, hiding, hunting, bursting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and leaves outside your window. So, I think, we lack a concept of propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
Then too there is the mystery of the emergence of novel functionalities in evolution where none existed before: hearing, sight, flight, language. Whence this novelty? I was led to doubt that we could prestate the novelty. I came to doubt that we could finitely prestate all possible adaptations that might arise in a biosphere. In turn, I was led to doubt that we can prestate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù</ENAMEX> of a biosphere.
But how strange a conclusion. In statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, with its famous liter box of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> as an isolated thermodynamic system, we can prestate the configuration space of all possible positions and momenta of the gas particles in the box. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ludwig Boltzmann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willard Gibbs</ENAMEX> taught us how to calculate macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature as equilibrium averages over the configuration space. State the laws and the initial and boundary conditions, then calculate; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newton</ENAMEX> taught us how to do science this way. What if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and calculate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Newton‚Äôs ‚Äúmethod</ENAMEX> of fluxions,‚Äù the calculus, from initial and boundary conditions and laws? Whether we can calculate or not does not slow down the persistent evolution of novelty in the biosphere. But a biosphere is just another physical system. So what in the world is going on? Literally, what in the world is going on?
We have much to investigate. At the end, I think we will know more than at the outset. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Investigations</ENAMEX> is at best a mere beginning.
It is well to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs brilliant insights and his attempt at a central definition of life as a well-grounded starting place. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Schr√∂dinger ‚Äòs What Is Life</ENAMEX>? provided a surprising answer to his enquiry about the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of life by posing a core question: What is the source of the astonishing order in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The standard¬†=¬†and Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> argued, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">incorrect¬†=¬†answer</ENAMEX>, lay in statistical physics. If an ink drop is placed in still water in a petri <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>, it will diVuse to a uniform equilibrium distribution. That uniform distribution is an average over an enormous number of atoms or molecules and is not due to the behavior of individual molecules. Any local fluctuations in ink concentration soon dissipate back to equilibrium.
Could statistical averaging be the source of order in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> based his argument on the emerging field of experimental genetics and the recent data on X-ray induction of heritable genetic mutations. Calculating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútarget size‚Äù</ENAMEX> of such mutations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> realized that a gene could comprise at most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> atoms.
The sizes of statistical fluctuations familiar from statistical physics scale as the square root of the number of particles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> Consider tossing a fair coin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> times. The result will be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 percent</NUMEX> heads, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> tails, with a fluctuation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX>, which is the square root of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX>. Thus, a typical fluctuation from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> and tails is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100/10,000</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX>. Let the number of coin flips be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 million</NUMEX>, then the fluctuations are its square root, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dividing</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10,000/100,000,000</TIMEX> yields a typical deviation of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.01 percent</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50:50</TIMEX>.
Schr√∂dinger reached the correct conclusion: If genes are constituted by as few as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> atoms, the familiar statistical fluctuations predicted by statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> would be so large that heritability would be essentially impossible. Spontaneous mutations would happen at a frequency vastly larger than observed. The source of order must lie elsewhere.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>, argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX>, comes to the rescue of life. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> ensures that solids have rigidly ordered molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX> is the simplest case. But crystals are structurally dull. The atoms are arranged in a regular lattice in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensions. If you know the positions of all the atoms in a minimal-unit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>, you know where all the other atoms are in the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>. This overstates the case, for there can be complex defects, but the point is clear. Crystals have very regular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, so the diVerent parts of the crystal, in some sense, all ‚Äúsay‚Äù the same thing. As shown below, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> translated the idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsaying‚Äù</ENAMEX> into the idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúencoding</ENAMEX>.‚Äù With that leap, a regular crystal cannot encode much ‚Äúinformation.‚Äù All the information is contained in the unit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solids</ENAMEX> have the order required but periodic solids such as crystals are too regular, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> puts his bet on aperiodic solids. The stuV of the gene, he bets, is some form of aperiodic crystal. The form of the aperiodicity will contain some kind of microscopic code that somehow controls the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. The quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the aperiodic solid will mean that small discrete changes, or mutations, will occur. Natural selection, operating on these small discrete changes, will select out favorable mutations, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> hoped.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fifty years later</TIMEX>, I find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs argument fascinating and brilliant. At once he envisioned what became, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1953</TIMEX>, the elucidation of the structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNA‚</ENAMEX>Äôs aperiodic double helix by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Watson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Crick</ENAMEX>, with the famously understated comment in their original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> that its structure suggests its mode of replication and its mode of encoding genetic information.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fifty years later</TIMEX> we know very much more. We know the human genome harbors <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 80,000 to 100,000</NUMEX> ‚Äústructural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,‚Äù each encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that, after being transcribed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, is translated according to the genetic code to a linear sequence of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, thereby constituting a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> to the establishment of the code required only about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX>.
Beyond the brilliance of the core of molecular genetics, we understand much concerning developmental biology. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Humans</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 260</NUMEX> diVerent cell types: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, nerve, muscle. Each is a diVerent pattern of expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80,000 or 100,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Since the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√ßois Jacob</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Monod thirty-five</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> have understood that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein transcribed</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> might turn other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> on or oV. Some vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of regulatory interactions among genes and their products provides the mechanism that marshals the genome into the dance of development.
We have come close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dream. But have we come close to answering his question, What is life? The answer almost surely is no. I am unable to say, all at once, why I believe this, but I can begin to hint at an explanation. Investigations is a search for an answer. I am not entirely convinced of what lies within this book; the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> is too new and far too surprising to warrant conviction. Yet the pathways I have stumbled along, glimpsing what may be a terra nova, do seem to me to be worth serious presentation and serious consideration.
Quite to my astonishment, the story that will unfold here suggests a novel answer to the question, What is life? I had not expected even the outlines of an answer, and I am astonished because I have been led in such unexpected directions. One direction suggests that an answer to this question may demand a fundamental alteration in how we have done science since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX>. Life is doing something far richer than we may have dreamed, literally something incalculable. What is the place of law if, as hinted above, the variables and configuration space cannot be prespecified for a biosphere, or perhaps a universe? Yet, I think, there are laws. And if these musings be true, we must rethink science itself.
Perhaps I can point again at the outset to the central question of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Consider a bacterium swimming upstream in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX>, its flagellar motor rotating. If we naively ask, ‚ÄúWhat is it doing?‚Äù we unhesitatingly answer something like, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs</ENAMEX> going to get dinner.‚Äù That is, without attributing consciousness or conscious purpose, we view the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> as acting on its own behalf in an environment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> is swimming upstream in order to obtain the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> it needs. Presumably we have in mind something like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> criteria to unpack the phrase, ‚Äúon its own behalf.<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù Bacteria</ENAMEX> that do obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose</ENAMEX> or its equivalent may survive with higher probability than those incapable of the flagellar motor trick, hence, be selected by natural selection.
An autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is a physical system, such as a bacterium, that can act on its own behalf in an environment. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are clearly autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. The quite familiar, utterly astonishing feature of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">agents¬†=¬†E</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coli</ENAMEX>, paramecia, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast cells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">algae</ENAMEX>, sponges, flat <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, annelids, all of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">us¬†=¬†is</ENAMEX> that we do, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX>, manipulate the universe around us. We swim, scramble, twist, build, hide, snuZe, pounce.
Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, the yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, and we all are just physical systems. Physicists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> no longer look for a mysterious √©lan vital, some ethereal vital force that animates matter. Which leads immediately to the central, and confusing, question: What must a physical system be such that it can act on its own behalf in an environment? What must a physical system be such that it constitutes an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>? I will leap ahead to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> now my tentative answer: A molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is a self-reproducing molecular system able to carry out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more thermodynamic work cycles.
All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are, by this definition, autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. To take a simple example, our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> with its flagellar motor rotating and swimming upstream for dinner is, in point of plain fact, a self-reproducing molecular system that is carrying out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more thermodynamic work cycles. So is the paramecium chasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, hoping for its own dinner. So is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinoflagellate</ENAMEX> hunting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paramecium</ENAMEX> sneaking up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>. So are the flower and flatworm. So are you and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX>
It will take a while to fully explore this definition. Unpacking its implications reveals much that I did not remotely anticipate. An early insight is that an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> must be displaced from thermodynamic equilibrium. Work cycles cannot occur at equilibrium. Thus, the concept of an agent is, inherently, a nonequilibrium concept. So too at the outset it is clear that this new concept of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is not contained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schr√∂dinger‚</ENAMEX>Äôs answer. Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs brilliant leap to aperiodic solids encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> that unleashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-twentieth-century</TIMEX> biology appears to be but a glimmer of a far larger story.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Footprints of Destiny: The Birth of Astrobiology</ENAMEX>
The telltale beginnings of that larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">story</ENAMEX> are beginning to be formulated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency</ENAMEX> has had a long program in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúexobiology</ENAMEX>,‚Äù the search for life elsewhere in the universe. Among its well-known interests are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SETI</ENAMEX>, a search for extraterrestrial life, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> probes. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades</TIMEX>, a sustained eVort has included a wealth of experiments aiming at discovering the abiotic origins of the organic molecules that are the building blocks of known living systems.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> was busy attempting to formulate what it came to call ‚Äúastrobiology,‚Äù an attempt to understand the origin, evolution, and characteristics of life anywhere in the universe. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astrobiology</ENAMEX> does not yet exist¬†=¬†it is a field in the birthing process. Whatever the area comes to be called as it matures, it seems likely to be a field of spectacular success and deep importance in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming century</TIMEX>. A hint of the potential impact of astrobiology came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1997</TIMEX> with the tentative but excited reports of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Martian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">meteorite</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> announced, might have evidence of early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Martian</ENAMEX> microbial life. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> organized the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">single-day</TIMEX> ‚ÄúSpace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conference</ENAMEX>,‚Äù to which I was pleased to be invited. Perhaps thirty-five <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> gathered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Executive OYce Building</ENAMEX> for a meeting led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> began the meeting with a rather unexpected question to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>: If it should prove true that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Martian</ENAMEX> rock actually harbored fossilized microbial life, what would be the least interesting result? 
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> was silent, for a moment. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Jay Gould</ENAMEX> gave the answer many of us must have been considering: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúMartian life turns out to be essentially identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> life, same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, code.‚Äù Were it so, then we would all envision life flitting from planet to planet in our solar system. It turns out that a minimum transit time for a fleck of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martian</ENAMEX> soil kicked into space to make it to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is about fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thousand years</TIMEX>. Spores can survive that long under desiccating conditions.
‚ÄúAnd what,‚Äù continued the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúwould be the most interesting result<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">?‚Äù Ah</ENAMEX>, said many of us, in diVerent voices around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>: Martian life is radically diVerent from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> life.
If radically diVerent, then.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>
If radically diVerent, then life must not be improbable.
If radically diVerent, then life may be abundant among the myriad stars and solar systems, on far planets hinted at by our current astronomy.
If radically diVerent and abundant, then we are not alone.
If radically diVerent and abundant, then we inhabit a universe rife with the creativity to create life.
If radically diVerent, then¬<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">†=¬†thought I</ENAMEX> of my just published <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">book¬†=¬†we</ENAMEX> are at home in the universe.
If radically diVerent, then we are on the threshold of a new biology, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgeneral biology‚</ENAMEX>Äù freed from the confines of our known example of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> life.
If radically diVerent, then a new science seeking the origins, evolution, characteristics, and laws that may govern biospheres anywhere.
A general biology awaits us. Call it astrobiology if you wish. We confront the vast new task of understanding what properties and laws, if any, may characterize bio-spheres anywhere in the universe. I find the prospect stunning. I will argue that the concept of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> will be central to the enterprise of a general biology.
A personally delightful moment arose during that meeting. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX>, it appeared, had read <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">At Home in the Universe</ENAMEX>, or parts of it. In At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home</ENAMEX>, and also in this book, I explore a theory I believe has deep merit, one that asserts that, in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> chemical reaction systems, self-reproducing molecular systems form with high probability.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> looked across the table at me and asked, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúDr</ENAMEX>. KauVman, don‚Äôt you have a theory that in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> chemical reaction systems life arises more or less spontaneously?‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúYes.</ENAMEX>‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúWell</ENAMEX>, isn‚Äôt that just sensible?‚Äù
I was, of course, rather thrilled, but somewhat embarrassed. ‚ÄúThe theory has been tested computationally, but there are no molecular experiments to support it,‚Äù I answered.
‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt it just sensible?‚Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> persisted.
I couldn‚Äôt help my response, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúMr</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, I have waited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> for such confirmation. With your permission, sir, I will use it to bludgeon my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
I‚Äôm glad to say there was warm laughter around the table. Would that scientific proof were so easily obtained. Much remains to be done to test my theory.
Many of us, including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>, while maintaining skepticism about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> rock itself, spoke at that meeting about the spiritual impact of the discovery of life elsewhere in the universe. The general consensus was that such a discovery, linked to the sense of membership in a creative universe, would alter how we see ourselves and our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">place</ENAMEX> under all, all the suns. I find it a gentle, thrilling, quiet, and transforming vision.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Diversity</ENAMEX>
We are surprisingly well poised to begin an investigation of a general biology, for such a study will surely involve the understanding of the collective behaviors of very complex chemical reaction networks. After all, all known life on earth is based on the complex webs of chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactions¬†=¬†DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, metabolism, linked cycles of construction and destruction¬†=¬†that form the life cycles of cells. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX> we have crossed a threshold that will rival the computer revolution. We have learned to construct enormously diverse ‚Äúlibraries‚Äù of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diVerent DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and other organic molecules. Armed with such high-diversity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, we are in a position to begin to study the properties of complex chemical reaction networks.
To begin to understand the molecular diversity revolution, consider a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> estimate of the total organic molecular diversity of the biosphere. There are perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Humans</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred thousand</NUMEX> structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, encoding that many diVerent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. If all the genes within a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were identical, and all the genes in diVerent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were at least slightly diVerent, the biosphere would harbor <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about ten trillion</NUMEX> diVerent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Within a few orders of magnitude, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> trillion will serve as an estimate of the organic molecular diversity of the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biosphere</ENAMEX>. But the current technology of molecular diversity that generates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of more or less random <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> now routinely produces a diversity of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred trillion</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in a single test tube.
In our hubris, we rival the biosphere.
The field of molecular diversity was born to help solve the problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery. The core concept is simple. Consider a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> such as estrogen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estrogen</ENAMEX> acts by binding to a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor protein</ENAMEX>; think of the estrogen as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúkey‚Äù</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúlock</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Now generate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX> diVerent small <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, called peptides, say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length. (Since there are twenty types of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>, the number of possible hexamers is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20Ô¨Ç</NUMEX>, hence, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX>.) The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX> hexamer peptides are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> second keys, any one of which might be able to fit into the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor lock into which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estrogen</ENAMEX> fits. If so, any such <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> key may be similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> key, estrogen, and hence is a candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> to mimic or modulate estrogen.
To find such an estrogen mimic, take many identical copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor, afix them to the bottom of a petri plate, and expose them simultaneously to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all sixty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX> hexamers. Wash oV all the peptides that do not stick to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor, then recover those hexamers that do stick to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX>. Any such peptide is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> key that binds the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor locks and, hence, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> estrogen mimic.
The procedure works, and works brilliantly. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Smith</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Missouri</ENAMEX> used a specific kind of virus, a filamentous phage that infects <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The phage is a strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> that encodes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Among these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is the coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that packages the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the phage as part of an infective phage particle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> cloned random <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences encoding random hexamer peptides into one end of the phage coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gene</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phage</ENAMEX> then carried a diVerent, random DNA sequence in its coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gene</ENAMEX>, hence made a coat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a random <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one end</TIMEX>. The initial resulting ‚Äúphage display‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about twenty million</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX> diVerent possible hexamer peptides.
Rather than using the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen receptor</ENAMEX> and seeking a peptide estrogen mimic that binds the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Smith</ENAMEX> used a monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> molecule as the analogue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and sought a hexamer peptide that could bind the monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> technology allows the generation of a large number of identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> molecules, hence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> could use these as identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mock receptors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> found that, among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty million</NUMEX> diVerent phage, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> would stick to his specific monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> molecules. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> found nineteen diVerent hexamers binding to his monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the nineteen diVerent hexamers diVered from one another, on average, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> positions. All had high aYnity for his monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> target. 
These results have been of very deep importance. Phage display is now a central part of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> discovery in many pharmaceutical and biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. The discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúdrug leads‚Äù</ENAMEX> is being transformed from a diYcult to a routine task. Not only is work being pursued using peptides but also using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>. Molecular diversity has now spread to the generation of high-diversity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of small organic molecules, an approach called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúcombinatorial chemistry</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The promise is of high medical importance. As we understand better the genetic diversity of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, we can hope to create well-crafted molecules with increased eYcacy as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>, enzymes, and novel molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. When the capacity to craft such molecules is married, as it will be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming decades</TIMEX>, to increased understanding of the genetic and cellular signaling pathways by which ontogeny is controlled, we will enter an era of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúpostgenomic‚Äù medicine</ENAMEX>. By learning to control gene regulation and cell signaling, we will begin to control cell proliferation, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell diVerentiation</ENAMEX>, and tissue regeneration to treat pathologies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, and degenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Smith‚</ENAMEX>Äôs experiments are also of immediate interest, and in surprising ways that will bear on our later discussion of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George‚Äôs</ENAMEX> experiments have begun to verify the concept of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúshape space‚</ENAMEX>Äù put forth by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Oster</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Perelson</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Alamos National Laboratory</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade earlier</TIMEX>. In turn, shape space suggests ‚Äúcatalytic task space.‚Äù We will need both to understand autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oster</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perelson</ENAMEX> had been concerned about accounting for the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> can make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred million</NUMEX> diVerent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> molecules. Why, they wondered. They conceived of an abstract shape space with perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight ‚Äúdimensions</NUMEX>.‚Äù <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of these dimensions would correspond to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> spatial dimensions, length, height, and width of a molecular binding site. Other dimensions might correspond to physical properties of the binding sites of molecules, such as charge, dipole moment, and hydrophobicity.
A point in shape space would represent a molecular shape. An <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> binds its shape complement, key and lock. But the precision with which an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> can recognize its shape complement is finite. Some jiggle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is allowed. So an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody molecule ‚Äúcovers‚Äù</ENAMEX> a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúball‚Äù</ENAMEX> of complementary shapes in shape space. And then comes the sweet argument. If an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> covers a ball, an actual volume, in shape space, then a finite number of balls will suYce to cover all of shape space. A reasonable analogy is that a finite number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ping-Pong</ENAMEX> balls will fill up a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>.
But how big of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ping-Pong</ENAMEX> ball in shape space is covered by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oster</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perelson</ENAMEX> reasoned that in order for an immune system to protect an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, its antibody repertoire should cover a reasonable fraction of shape space. Newts, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diVerent antibody</ENAMEX> molecules, have the minimal known antibody diversity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perelson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oster</ENAMEX> guessed that the newt repertoire must cover a substantial fraction, say about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1/e¬†=¬†where e</ENAMEX> is the natural base for logarithms¬†=¬†or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 percent</NUMEX> of shape space. Dividing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37 percent</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> gives the fractional volume of shape space covered by one antibody molecule. It follows that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000,000</NUMEX> such balls, thrown at random into shape space and allowed to overlap one another, will saturate shape space. So, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 million</NUMEX> antibody molecules is all we need to recognize virtually any shape of the size scale of molecular binding sites.
And therefore the concept of shape space carries surprising implications. Not surprisingly, similar molecules can have similar shapes. More surprisingly, very diVerent molecules can have the same shape. Examples include endorphin and morphine. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endorphin</ENAMEX> is a peptide hormone. When endorphin binds the endorphin brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, a euphoric <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is induced. Morphine, a completely diVerent kind of organic molecule, binds the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endorphin</ENAMEX> receptor as well, with well-known consequences. Still more surprising, a finite number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diVerent</ENAMEX> molecules, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred million</NUMEX>, can constitute a universal shape <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. Thus, while there are vastly many diVerent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the number of eVectively diVerent shapes may only be on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred million</NUMEX>.
If one molecule binding to a second molecule can be thought of as carrying out a ‚Äúbinding task,‚Äù then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred million</NUMEX> diVerent molecules may constitute a universal toolbox for all molecular binding tasks. So if we can now create <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 trillion</NUMEX> diVerent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, a millionfold in excess of the universal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, we are in a position to begin to study molecular binding in earnest.
But there may also be a universal enzymatic toolbox. Enzymes catalyze, or speed up, chemical reactions. Consider a substrate molecule undergoing a reaction to a product molecule. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemists</ENAMEX> think of the substrate and product molecules as lying in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential ‚Äúenergy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>,‚Äù like a ball at the bottom of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adjacent bowls. A chemical reaction requires ‚Äúlifting‚Äù the substrate energetically to the top of the barrier between the bowls. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Physically</ENAMEX>, the substrate‚Äôs bonds are maximally strained and deformed at the top of this potential barrier. The deformed molecule is called the ‚Äútransition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.‚Äù According to transition state theory, an enzyme works by binding to and stabilizing the transition state molecule, thereby lowering the potential barrier of the reaction. Since the probability that a molecule acquires enough energy to hop to the top of the potential barrier is exponentially less as the barrier height increases, the stabilization of the transition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by the enzyme can speed up the reaction by many orders of magnitude.
Think of a catalytic task space, in which a point represents a catalytic task, where a catalytic task is the binding of a transition state of a reaction. Just as similar molecules can have similar shapes, so too can similar reactions have similar transition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, hence, such reactions constitute similar catalytic tasks. Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diVerent</ENAMEX> molecules can have the same shape, so too can diVerent reactions have similar transition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, hence constitute the ‚Äúsame‚Äù catalytic task. Just as an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> can bind to and cover a ball of similar shapes, an enzyme can bind to and cover a ball of similar catalytic tasks. Just as a finite number of balls can cover shape space, a finite number of balls can cover catalytic task space.
In short, a universal enzymatic toolbox is possible. Clues that such a toolbox is experimentally feasible come from many recent developments, including the discovery that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> molecules, evolved to bind molecular features called epitopes, can actually act as catalysts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Catalytic antibodies</ENAMEX> are obtained exactly as one might expect, given the concept of a catalytic task space. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would like an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> molecule that binds the transition state of a reaction. But transition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are ephemeral. Since they last only fractions of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, one cannot immunize with a transition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> itself. Instead, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> immunizes with a stable analogue of the transition shape; that is, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> immunizes with a second molecule that represents the ‚Äúsame‚Äù catalytic task as does the transition <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> itself. Antibody molecules binding to this transition state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analogue</ENAMEX> are tested. Typically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> molecules can function as at least a weak catalyst for the corresponding reaction.
These results even allow a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> estimate of the probability that a randomly chosen antibody molecule will catalyze a randomly chosen reaction. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX> can bind a randomly chosen epitope. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About one</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> that bind the transition state analogue act as catalysts. By this crude calculation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> antibody molecules can catalyze a given reaction.
This rough calculation is probably too high by several orders of magnitude, even for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> molecules. Recent experiments begin to address the probability that a randomly chosen peptide or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA sequence</ENAMEX> will catalyze a randomly chosen reaction. The answer for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> appears to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a billion</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX>. If we now make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred trillion</NUMEX> random <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, and protein molecules, we may already have in hand universal enzymatic toolboxes. Virtually any reaction, on the proper molecular scale of reasonable substrates and products, probably has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more catalysts in such a universal toolbox.
In short, among the radical implications of molecular diversity is that we already possess <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of diVerent</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">functions¬†=¬†binding</ENAMEX>, catalytic, structural, and otherwise.
In our hubris, we rival the biosphere.
In our humility, we can begin to formulate a general biology and begin to investigate the collective behaviors of hugely diverse molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. Among these collective behaviors must be life itself.
Life as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergent Collective Behavior of Complex Chemical Networks</ENAMEX>
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Anderson</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laureate</ENAMEX> in physics, and I accompanied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry MacDonald</ENAMEX>, incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ames</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. Our purpose was to discuss a new linked experimental and theoretical approach to the origin-of-life problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA Administrator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Golden</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wesley Huntress</ENAMEX>. I was excited and delighted.
As long ago as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, I had published my own first foray into the origin-of-life problem as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant professor</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Theoretical Biology</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>. I had wondered if life must be based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template replicating nucleic acids</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> double helices and found myself doubting that standard assumption. Life, at its core, depends upon autocatalysis, that is, reproduction. Most catalysis in cells is carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein enzymes</ENAMEX>. Might there be general laws supporting the possibility that systems of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">catalytic polymers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> might be self-reproducing? <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Proteins</ENAMEX> are, as noted, linear sequences of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> kinds of standard amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Consider, then, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> copy of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has the capacity to catalyze a reaction by which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments of a potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> copy of that same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> might be ligated to make the second copy of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Such a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, A, say, thirty-two amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long, might act on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments, say, fifteen amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and seventeen amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length, and ligate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to make a second copy of the thirty-two amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX>.
But if one could imagine a molecule, A, catalyzing its own formation from its own fragments, could one not imagine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, A and B, having the property that A catalyzes the formation of B by ligating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fragments into a second copy of B, while B catalyzes the formation of A by catalyzing the ligation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fragments into a second copy of A? Such a little reaction system would be collectively autocatalytic. Neither A alone, nor B alone, would catalyze its own formation. Rather the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> system would jointly catalyze its reproduction from A and B fragments. But if A and B might achieve collective autocatalysis, might one envision a system with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens or hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, or peptides, that were collectively autocatalytic?
Might collective autocatalysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or similar polymers be the basic source of self-reproduction in molecular systems? Or must life be based on template replication, as envisioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crick</ENAMEX>, or as envisioned even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schr√∂dinger</ENAMEX> in his aperiodic solid with its microcode? In view of the potential for a general biology, what, in fact, are the alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> for self-reproducing molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> here and anywhere in the cosmos? Which of these alternatives is more probable, here and anywhere?
By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX> I had asked and found a preliminary answer to the following question: In a complex mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diVerent proteins</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> might be able to serve as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to ligate one another into still larger amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequences</ENAMEX>, what are the chances that such a system will contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more collectively autocatalytic sets of molecules? In the next chapter I will discuss the current state of theory and experiment on this issue. The best current guess is that, as the molecular diversity of a reaction system increases, a critical threshold is reached at which collectively autocatalytic, self-reproducing chemical reaction networks emerge spontaneously.
If this view is correct, and the kinetic conditions for rapid reactions can be sustained, perhaps by enclosure of such a reproducing system in a bounding membrane vesicle, also synthesized by the system, the emergence of self-reproducing molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> may be highly probable. No small conclusion this: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life</ENAMEX> abundant, emergent, expected. Life spattered across megaparsecs, galaxies, galactic clusters. We as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a creative, mysteriously unfolding universe. Moreover, the hypothesis is richly testable and, as described in the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, is now under the early stages of testing.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way or another, we will discover a second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">life¬†=¬†crouched</ENAMEX> under a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> rock, frozen in time; limpid in some pool on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titan</ENAMEX>, in some test tube in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few decades</TIMEX>. We will discover a second life, one way or another.
What monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transformations</ENAMEX> await us, proudly postmodern, mingled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> on this very globe still wedded to archetypes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Strange Thing About the Theory of Evolution</ENAMEX>
We do not understand evolution. We live it with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">moss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, fin, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quill fellows</ENAMEX>. We see it since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX>. We have insights of forms and their formation, won from eVorts since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aristotle</ENAMEX> codified the embryological investigations that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-five centuries</TIMEX> ago began with the study of deformed fetuses in sacrificial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
But we do not understand evolution.
‚ÄúThe strange thing about the theory of evolution,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> said one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huxleys</ENAMEX> (although I cannot find which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>), ‚Äúis that everyone thinks he understands it.‚Äù How very well stated in that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> can admire but not emulate. (‚ÄúTwo peoples separated by a common language,‚Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX> dryly put it.)
The strange thing about the theory of evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it. How very true. It seems, of course, so simple. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finches</ENAMEX> hop around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galapagos</ENAMEX>, occasionally migrating from island to island. Small and large beaks serve for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diVerent seeds</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Beaks</ENAMEX> fitting seeds feed the young. Well-wrought beaks are selected. Mutations are the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feedstock</ENAMEX> of heritable variation in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Populations evolve by mutation, mating, recombination, and selection to give the well-marked varieties that are, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Phylogenies bushy in the biosphere. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre</ENAMEX> here, we‚Äôre here,‚Äù cry all for their typical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX>-year-stay along the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-billion-year</TIMEX> pageant.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre</ENAMEX> here!‚Äù
But how?
How, in many senses. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs theory of evolution is a theory of descent with modification. It does not yet explain the genesis of forms, but the trimmings of the forms, once they are generated. ‚ÄúRather like achieving an apple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> by trimming oV all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> said a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-nineteenth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skeptic</ENAMEX>.
How, in the most fundamental sense: Whence life in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> starts with life already here. Whence life is the stuV of all later questions about whence the forms to sift.
How, in still a diVerent sense. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> assumed gradualism. Most variation would be minor. Selection would sift these insensible alterations, a bit more lift, a little less drag, until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> flew faultless in the high-hoped sky, a falcon‚Äôs knot-winged, claw-latching dive to dine.
But whence the gradualism itself? It is not God given, but true, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are hardly aVected by most mutations. Most mutations do have little eVect, some have major eVects. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> make small modifications in bristle number, color, shape. A few change wings to legs, eyes to antennae, heads to genitalia. Suppose that all mutations were of dramatic eVect. Suppose, to take the limiting philosophical case, that all mutations were what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticists</ENAMEX> call ‚Äúlethals.‚Äù Since, indeed, some mutations are lethals, one can, a priori, imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> in which all mutations were lethal prior to having oVspring. Might be fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, too, in the absence of any mutations, these evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of, well, of what? And <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> of whom? No pathway to or from these luckless ones.
Thus, evolution must somehow be crafting the very capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> to evolve. Evolution nurtures herself! But not yet in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Darwin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs theory, nor yet in ours.
Take another case¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">†=¬†sex</ENAMEX>. Yes, it captures our attention, and the attention of most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of most species. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are sexual. But why bother? Asexuals, budding quietly wherever they bud, require only a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>. We plumaged ones require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, a twofold loss in fitness.
Why sex? The typical answer, to which I adhere, is that sexual mating gives the opportunity for genetic recombination. In genetic recombination, the double chromosome complement sets, maternal and paternal homologues, pair up, break and recombine to yield oVspring chromosomes the left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of which derives from one parental chromosome, the right <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of which derives from the other parental chromosome.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombination</ENAMEX> is said to be a useful ‚Äúsearch procedure‚Äù in an evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Consider, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticist</ENAMEX> would say, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, each with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> versions, or alleles: A and a for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> gene, B and b for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gene. Suppose A confers a selective advantage compared to a, and B confers an advantage with respect to b. In the absence of sex, mating, and recombination, a rabbit with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> and b would have to wait for a mutation to convert b to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. That</ENAMEX> might take a long time. But, with mating and recombination, a rabbit with A on the left end of a maternal chromosome, and B on the right end of the homologous paternal chromosome might experience recombination. A and B would now be on a single chromosome, hence be passed on to the oVspring. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombination</ENAMEX>, therefore, can be a lot faster than waiting for mutation to assemble the good, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> chromosome.
But it is not so obvious that recombination is a good idea after all. At the molecular level, the recombination procedure is rather like taking an airplane and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX>, breaking both in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, and using spare bolts to attach the back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the airplane to the front <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX>. The resulting contraption seems useless for any purpose. 
In short, the very usefulness of recombination depends upon the gradualness that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> assumed. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> chapters I will discuss the concept of a ‚Äúfitness landscape.‚Äù The basic idea is simple. Consider a set of all possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX>, each with a diVerent genotype. Locate each frog in a high<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-dimensional ‚Äúgenotype</ENAMEX> space,‚Äù each next to all genotypes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diVer</ENAMEX> from it by a single mutation. Imagine that you can measure the fitness of each frog. Graph the fitness of each frog as a height above that position in genotype space. The resulting heights form a fitness landscape over the genotype space, much as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> form a mountainous landscape over part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
In the fitness landscape, image, mutation, recombination, and selection can conspire to pull evolving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> upward toward the peaks of high fitness. But not always. It is relatively easy to show that recombination is only a useful search procedure on smooth fitness landscapes. The smoothness of a fitness landscape can be defined mathematically by a correlation function giving the similarity of fitnesses, or heights, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points on the landscape separated by a mutational distance. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>, most nearby points are of similar heights, except for cliVs, but points fifty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> apart can be of very diVerent heights. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Fifty kilometers</NUMEX> is beyond the correlation length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>.
There is good evidence that recombination is only a useful search strategy on smooth, highly correlated landscapes, where the high peaks all cluster near one another. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombination</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> airplane‚Äìhalf <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycle</ENAMEX>, is a means to look ‚Äúbetween‚Äù <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> positions in a high-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. Then if both points are in the region of high peaks, looking between those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points is likely to uncover further new points of high fitness, or points on the slopes of even higher peaks. Thereafter, further mutation, recombination, and selection can bring the adapting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to successively higher peaks in the high-peaked region of the genotype space. If landscapes are very rugged and the high peaks do not cluster into smallish regions, recombination turns out to be a useless search strategy.
But most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are sexual. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are sexual because recombination is a good search strategy, but recombination is only useful as a search strategy on certain classes of fitness landscapes, where did those fitness landscapes come from? No one knows.
The strange thing about evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it.
Somehow, evolution has brought forth the kind of smooth landscapes upon which recombination itself is a successful search strategy.
More generally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX>, then at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX>, proved a rather unsettling theorem. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Macready</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wolpert</ENAMEX> called it the ‚Äúno-free-lunch theorem.‚Äù They asked an innocent question. Are there some search procedures that are ‚Äúgood‚Äù search procedures, no matter what the problem is? To formalize this, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mathematical convenience¬†=¬†a</ENAMEX> set of all possible fitness landscapes. To be simple and concrete, consider a large three-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Divide the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> into very small cubic volumes, perhaps a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">millimeter</NUMEX> on a side. Let the number of these small volumes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> be large, say a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX>. Now consider all possible ways of assigning integers between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX>, to these small volumes. Any such assignment can be thought of as a fitness landscape, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">integer</ENAMEX> representing the fitness of that position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
Next, formalize a search procedure as a process that somehow samples <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> distinct volumes among the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. A search procedure specifies how to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> samples. An example is a random search, choosing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> boxes at random. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> procedure starts at a box and samples its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, climbing uphill via neighboring boxes toward higher integers. Still another procedure picks a box, samples <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and picks those with lower integers, then continues.
The no-free-lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorem</ENAMEX> says that, averaged over all possible fitness landscape, no search procedure outperforms any other search procedure. What? Averaged over all possible fitness landscapes, you would do as well trying to find a large integer by searching randomly from an initial box for your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> as you would climbing sensibly uphill from your initial box.
The theorem is correct. In the absence of any knowledge, or constraint, on the fitness landscape, on average, any search procedure is as good as any other.
But life uses mutation, recombination, and selection. These search procedures seem to be working quite well. Your typical bat or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> has managed to get itself evolved and seems a rather impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>. The no-free-lunch theorem brings into high relief the puzzle. If mutation, recombination, and selection only work well on certain kinds of fitness landscapes, yet most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are sexual, and hence use recombination, and all organisms use mutation as a search mechanism, where did these well-wrought fitness landscapes come from, such that evolution manages to produce the fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stuV</ENAMEX> around us?
Here, I think, is how. Think of an organism‚Äôs niche as a way of making a living. Call a way of making a living a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">‚Äúnatural</ENAMEX> game.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Then</ENAMEX>, of course, natural games evolve with the organisms making those livings during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four billion years</TIMEX>. What, then, are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwinning games‚Äù</ENAMEX>? Naturally, the winning games are the games the winning organisms play. One can almost see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> nod. But what games are those? What games are the games the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> play?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways</ENAMEX> of making a living, natural games, that are well searched out and well mastered by the evolutionary search strategies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, namely, mutation and recombination, will be precisely the niches, or ways of making a living, that a diversifying and speciating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> will manage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>. The ways of making a living presenting fitness landscapes that can be well searched by the procedures that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> have in hand will be the very ways of making a living that readily come into existence. If there were a way of making a living that could not be well explored and exploited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> as they speciate, that way of making a living would not become populated. Good jobs, like successful jobholders, prosper.
So <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, niches, and search procedures jointly and self-consistently coconstruct one another! We make the world in which we make a living such that we can, and have, more or less mastered that evolving world as we make it. The same is true, I will argue, for an econosphere. A web of economic activities, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, tasks, jobs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, skills, and learning, self-consistently came into existence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last forty thousand years</TIMEX> of human evolution.
The strange thing about the theory of evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it. But we do not. A biosphere, or an econosphere, self-consistently coconstructs itself according to principles we do not yet fathom.
Laws for a Biosphere
But there must be principles. Think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magna Carta</ENAMEX>, that cultural enterprise founded on a green meadow in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> I was confronted by his nobles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX> common law has evolved by precedent and determinations to a tangled web of more-or-less wisdom. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> makes a new determination, sets a new precedent, ripples of new interpretation pass to near and occasionally far reaches of the law. Were it the case that every new precedent altered the interpretation of all old judgments, the common law could not have coevolved into its rich tapestry. Conversely, if new precedents never sent out ripples, the common law could hardly evolve at all.
There must be principles of coevolutionary assembly for biospheres, economic systems, legal systems. Coevolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> must involve coevolving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> flexible enough to change but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> enough to resist change. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Burke</ENAMEX> was basically right. Might there be something deep here? Some hint of a law of coevolutionary assembly?
Perhaps. I begin with the simple example oVered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Per Bak</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years</TIMEX> ago¬<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">†=¬†Bak‚Äôs ‚Äúsand pile‚Äù</ENAMEX> and ‚Äúself-organized criticality.‚Äù The experiment requires a table and some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>. Drop the sand slowly on the table. The sand gradually piles up, fills the tabletop, piles to the rest angle of sand, then sand avalanches begin to fall to the floor.
Keep adding sand slowly to the sand pile and plot the size distribution of sand avalanches. You will obtain many small avalanches and progressively fewer large avalanches. In fact, you will achieve a characteristic size distribution called a ‚Äúpower law.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Power</ENAMEX> law distributions are easily seen if one plots the logarithm of the number of avalanches at a given size on the y-axis, and the logarithm of the size of the avalanche on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis. In the sand pile case, a straight line sloping downward to the right is obtained. The slope is the power law relation between the size and number of avalanches.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bak</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> called their sand pile ‚Äúself-organized critical.<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù Here</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúcritical‚Äù</ENAMEX> means that avalanches occur on all length scales, ‚Äúself-organized‚Äù means that the system tunes itself to this critical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
Many of us have now explored the application of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bak‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ideas in models of coevolution that I will discuss shortly. With caveats that other explanations may account for the data, the general result is that something may occur that is like a theory of coevolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> that yields a self-organized critical biosphere with a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events. As we shall see, the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 650 million years</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phanerozoic</ENAMEX>. In addition, the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation, while some live a long time. The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law. So too are the data. 
Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere. Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Arthur</ENAMEX>, is fond of pointing out that when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> came in, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, buggy, buggy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX>, saddlery, smithy, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pony Express</ENAMEX> went out of business. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> paved the way for an oil and gas industry, paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX>, fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and suburbia. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Schumpeter</ENAMEX> wrote about this kind of turbulence in capitalist economies. These <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Schumpeterian</ENAMEX> gales of creative destruction appear to occur in small and large avalanches. Perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">avalanches</ENAMEX> arise in power laws. And, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> die young; some make it to old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">age¬†=¬†Storre</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>, is over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine hundred years old</TIMEX>. The distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> lifetimes is again a power law.
Here are hints¬†=¬†common law, ecosystems, economic systems¬†=¬†that general principles govern the coevolutionary coconstruction of lives and livings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and natural games, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and economic opportunities. Perhaps such a law governs any biosphere anywhere in the cosmos.
I shall suggest other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> laws for any biosphere in the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investigations</ENAMEX>. As autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> coconstruct a biosphere, each must manage to categorize and act upon its world in its own behalf. What principles might govern that categorization and action, one might begin to wonder. I suspect that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> coevolve such that each makes the maximum diversity of reliable discriminations upon which it can act reliably as it swims, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scrambles</ENAMEX>, pokes, twists, and pounces. This simple view leads to a working hypothesis: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> will coevolve to an ‚Äúedge of chaos‚Äù between overrigid and overfluid behavior. The working hypothesis is richly testable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> using, for example, microbial communities.
Moreover, autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> forever push their way into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">novelty¬†=¬†molecular</ENAMEX>, morphological, behavioral, organizational. I will formalize this push into novelty as the mathematical concept of an ‚Äúadjacent possible,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù persistently explored</ENAMEX> in a universe that can never, in the vastly many lifetimes of the universe, have made all possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences even once, bacterial species even once, or legal systems even once. Our universe is vastly nonrepeating; or, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> say, the universe is vastly nonergodic. Perhaps there are laws that govern this nonergodic flow. I will suggest that a biosphere gates its way into the adjacent possible at just that rate at which its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> can just manage to make a living, just poised so that selection sifts out useless variations slightly faster than those variations arise. We ourselves, in our biosphere, econosphere, and technosphere, gate our rate of discovery. There may be hints here too of a general law for any biosphere, a hoped-for new law for self-constructing systems of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Biospheres, on average, may enter their adjacent possible as rapidly as they can sustain; so too may econospheres. Then the hoped-for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics for such self-constructing systems will be that they tend to maximize their dimensionality, the number of types of events that can happen next.
And astonishingly, we need stories. If, as I will suggest, we cannot prestate the configuration space, variables, laws, initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere, if we cannot foretell a biosphere, we can, nevertheless, tell the stories as it unfolds. Biospheres demand their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakespeares</ENAMEX> as well as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newtons</ENAMEX>. We will have to rethink what science is itself. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. P. Snow‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ‚Äútwo cultures,‚Äù the humanities and science may find an unexpected, inevitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX>.
Investigations leads us to new views of the biosphere as a coconstructing system. In the final chapter, I step beyond the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to consider the universe itself. Again, there are hints of coconstruction¬†=¬†of the laws themselves, of the complexity of the universe, of geometry itself. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epilogue</ENAMEX> concludes with limits to reductionism in its strong form and an invocation to a constructivist science.
