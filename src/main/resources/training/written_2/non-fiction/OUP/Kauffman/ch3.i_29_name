<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autonomous Agents</ENAMEX>
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wellspring</ENAMEX> of creation, lithe in the scattered sunlight of an early planet, whispered something to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, who whispered back, and the mystery came alive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> was spawned. With it, the nature of the universe changed, for some new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of matter, energy, information, and something more could reach out and manipulate the world on its own behalf. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selfish</ENAMEX>? Yes. But how does matter, energy, information, and something else miraculous become selfish? From that miracle grew a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">biosphereÂ =Â and</ENAMEX>, we must surmise, from that grow other biospheres, scattered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> and gardens across the cosmos.
Pregnant in the birth of the universe was the birth of life. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> may be coextensive with life. Life certainly burgeons nowhere without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>. We all act on our own behalf. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kantian</ENAMEX> form: What must something be such that it can act on its own behalf?
I will hazard again my tentative answer, baldly now, then return to it: An autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> must be an autocatalytic system able to reproduce and able to perform one or more thermodynamic work cycles.
The thrashing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> swimming upstream in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX> is an autocatalytic system able to reproduce. In its swimming, it is carrying out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more thermodynamic work cycles. Can I deduce this tentative definition from some more primary categories? I do not know how. At the beginning, I jumpedÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> =Â more realistically</ENAMEX>, I struggledÂ =Â for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> searching for a constellation of properties that seemed promising, in order to articulate something I sensed but could not yet say. It has taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four more years</TIMEX> to understand more of what I still can only partially say in these investigations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Definitional Jumps and Circles</ENAMEX>
What of definitional jumps in science? 
So a pause to look at such jumps, to new clusters of concepts that, whole cloth, change how we carve up the world. Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Newton</ENAMEX> and his famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F = MA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is equal to mass times acceleration. It all seems sensible. If a log lies on an iced pond and I push it, it accelerates. If I push harder, it accelerates faster. If there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> logs, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on top of the other, and I push, the two accelerate less rapidly than if there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> log.
â€œI make no hypotheses,â€ stated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX>. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PoincarÃ©</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two centuries later</TIMEX>, argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newtonâ</ENAMEX>€™s brilliant move was definitional. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> terms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AÂ =Â force</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">accelerationÂ =Â argued PoincarÃ©</ENAMEX>, admit no independent definitions. Acceleration is independently definable by the metric concepts of distance, motion, time, the rate of change of position with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">timeÂ =Â velocity</ENAMEX>, and the rate change of velocity with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">timeÂ =Â acceleration</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> are, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PoincarÃ©</ENAMEX>, joined at the hip, codefined, one in terms of the other. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> is that which resists acceleration by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> is that which induces acceleration when applied to a mass. 
The equation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F = MA</ENAMEX> is a definitional circle, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PoincarÃ©.</ENAMEX> Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> disagree with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PoincarÃ©.</ENAMEX> I tend to agree, but then I am not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX>, so take care.
On the other hand, the great twentieth<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosopher</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ludwig Witt-gen-stein</ENAMEX> said something similar in his <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">majestic Philosophical Investigations</ENAMEX>. Witt-genstein came to his revolutionary investigations painfully, ultimately rejecting his own earlier triumph in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tractatus</ENAMEX>. Indeed, part of why I have so blatantly borrowed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Wittgensteinâ€™s</ENAMEX> title, without my presumption to similar intellectual stature, is that there is a parallel between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wittgensteinâ</ENAMEX>€™s abandonment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tractatus</ENAMEX> and growing awareness of knowing as living a language game, and a central theme of this Investigations, that there may be a limit to the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newton</ENAMEX> taught us to do science and a need to reformulate what we do when we and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> get on with living a life. As we will see, in both cases, it appears that something profound is going on in the universe that is not finitely prestatable. Life and language games seem persistently open to radical innovations that cannot be deduced from previous categories and concepts. I will only be able to discuss these issues more fully after we have encountered autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and their unfolding mysteries.
In his early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tractatus, Wittgenstein</ENAMEX> had brought to conclusion the mandate of logical atomism from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell</ENAMEX>. Logical atomism sought a firm epistemological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> for all knowledge in terms of privileged â€œatomic statementsâ€ <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about â</NUMEX>€œsense data.â€ The idea, flowing from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hume</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kant</ENAMEX> then back to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> empiricism, was the following: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> might be mistaken in saying that a chair is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, but one could hardly be mistaken in reporting bits and pieces of oneâ€™s own awareness. For example, â€œI am having the experience of a brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">colorâ€</ENAMEX>; â€œI am aware of the note A-flat.â€ These statements were thought to record sense data and to be less susceptible to error than statements about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œexternal worldâ€</ENAMEX> of chairs, rocks, and legal systems. Logical atomism sought to reconstruct statements about the external world from logical combinations of atomic statements about sense data. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tractatus</ENAMEX> sought to bring that program to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fruitionÂ Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â Â and</ENAMEX> nearly succeeded.
It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wittgenstein</ENAMEX> himself who, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years later</TIMEX>, junked the entire enterprise. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philosophical Investigations</ENAMEX> was his later-life revolution. His revolution has done much to destroy the concept of a privileged level of description and paved the way to an understanding that concepts at any level typically are formed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">codefi-nitional</ENAMEX> circles. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newton</ENAMEX> was just ahead of his time.
You see, even in the case of the physical chair, the idea that we can reconstruct statements about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">chairs</ENAMEX> as equivalent to combinations of statements about sense data fails. The failure is deep and will have unfolding resonances with the mysteries of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. The program to replace statements about physical objects with sets of statements about sense data requires â€œlogical equivalence.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ Logical</ENAMEX> equivalence means that wherever a statement about a chair occurs at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œhigher levelâ€</ENAMEX> of description, it must be possible to specify a list of statements about sense data whose truth are jointly necessary and suYcient for the statement about the chair to be true. For example, the statement, â€œThere is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX> rocker in the living room,â€ must be implied by, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œI</ENAMEX> seem to be seeing a brown surface with a given shape,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â</ENAMEX>€œI feel a hard surface,â€ and also, â€œWhen I push the top of the shape, I observe an oscillatory motion of the brown surface.â€
The trouble is, it appears to be impossible to finitely prespecify a set of statements about sense data whose truth is logically equivalent to statements about chairs. What if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> were colorblind, or blind, or deaf, or not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> but might enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> wearing hobnailed boots, fall on the chair, and break it? Could we finitely specify the list, â€œIf I were to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, I would have the following sense data; and if one who is red-green colorblind were to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> he or she would have the following sense data; and if the rocker were to be on a soft rug, the sounds that would be heard by one who is A-flat tone deaf <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wouldÂ Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>. To achieve this end, we would have to be able to finitely prespecify something about a set of statements concerning atomic sense data statements whose truth would be necessary and suYcient to the truth of a statement about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX> chair in the living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
The problem, briefly, is that there appears to be no finitely prestatable set of conditions about sense data statements whose truth is logically equivalent to any statement about a real physical chair in a living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Wittgenstein</ENAMEX> invented the concept of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">â€œlanguage</ENAMEX> game,â€ a codefined cluster of concepts that carve up the world in some new way. Consider, he said, legal language, and try translating it to ordinary statements about human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> without using legal concepts. So consider, â€œThe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> found <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henderson</ENAMEX> guilty of murder.â€ We understand this statement but do so in the context of law, evidence, legal responsibility, trials, guilt and innocence, jury systems, bribing jury <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, appeal processes, and so forth. Now try to translate the statement into a set of statements about ordinary human actions, â€œA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were seated behind a wooden enclosure for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> talked about someone having died of poison. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One day</TIMEX>, the twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> left the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and went to another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and talked about what had happened. Then the twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> came back and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> stood up and uttered the words, â€˜We find <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henderson</ENAMEX> guilty of murder.â€™â€
There is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> found <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henderson</ENAMEX> guilty of murder.
Another example concerns the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> going to war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. There is no finitely prespecifiable set of ways this must happen. Thus, the queen, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, might betake herself to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> and cry, â€œWe are at war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>!â€ Or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> might in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> say, â€œMembers, by the authority of my oYce I declare that we are at war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>!â€ Or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">irate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leeds</ENAMEX> might shoulder picks, take to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX>, funnel in fury up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhine</ENAMEX>, and attack football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Koblenz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">OrÂ Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Â Â Â </ENAMEX>. In short, there is no prestatable set of necessary and suYcient conditions about the actions of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> to manage to go to war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. (And may neither <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> again find a way to make war on the other in the future.)
Wittgensteinâ€™s point is that one cannot, in general, reduce statements at a higher level to a finitely specified set of necessary and suYcient statements at a lower level. Instead, the concepts at the higher level are codefined. We understand â€œguilty of murderâ€ within the legal language game and thus in terms of a codefining cluster of concepts concerning the features noted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">aboveÂ =Â law</ENAMEX>, legal responsibility, evidence, trial, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>.
Useful new concepts arise in codefining clusters. It is fine that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F = MA</ENAMEX> is circular, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PoincarÃ©</ENAMEX> might say, for the codefining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> is at the center of a wider web of concepts, many of which have reference to the world; hence, the web of concepts touches, articulates, discriminates, and categorizes the world.
So too did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> jump to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">definitional circle</ENAMEX> with his concept of natural selection, heritable variation, and fitness. Many have worried that natural selection and fitness, which is defined as an increased expected number of oVspring, are a definitional circle. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F = MA</ENAMEX>, the definitional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> is virtuous.
So too I jump to the tentative definition, â€œAn autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is a system able to reproduce itself and carry out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more thermodynamic work cycles.â€ Actually, at this stage my own tentative definition is not circular because <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œreproduce itselfâ€</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œwork cycleâ€</ENAMEX> are definable independently. But as we delve further into the concept of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, cyclic definitions arise concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">â€œwork,â€ â</ENAMEX>€œpropagating work,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€ â€œconstraints,â€ â</ENAMEX>€œpropagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€ â€œtask</ENAMEX>.â€ I hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> is virtuous and brings us toward a new understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œorganizationâ€</ENAMEX> itself.
In short, unpacking this definition will lead us into odd territory. Part of the oddness is the question of just what is the proper mathematical form to describe an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Is it a number, hence, a scalar? A list of numbers, hence, a vector? A tensor? I think not. An autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is a relational concept. In a later chapter I will suggest a spare mathematical form for an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> derived from category theory. This attempt is better than nothing, but I am not persuaded that eVort is satisfactory, for the mathematical mappings of category theory are themselves finitely prestatable and a biosphere, I both fear and celebrate, is not. Somethings new are needed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autonomous Agents</ENAMEX>
Well, letâ€™s have at it. I begin with the cornerstone of thermodynamics, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadi Carnot</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> writing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> had recently lost the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Napoleonic Wars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterloo</ENAMEX> had come and gone, a certain famous statue to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX> had been erected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. Carnot, like others at the time, realized that part of the success achieved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> had to do with early industrial economic power. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brits</ENAMEX> had large numbers of steam pumps that were able to clear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> and iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX>, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> to work under bad but relatively dry conditions and extract <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> and iron more eVectively than could their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> counterparts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX> and iron in turn were worked into the machinery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Industrial Revolution</ENAMEX> and cannons and also, notably, more steam pumps that could keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> in working condition. I find it fascinating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> system was an autocatalytic technology, iron and coal fueled the manufacture of pumps that abetted the mining of iron and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coal</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> set about understanding the fundamentals of the extraction of mechanical work from thermal energy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The result of his eVort was an analysis of an idealized device to extract mechanical work from heat, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle. Carnot titled his work <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">â€œAn Investigation on the Motive Force of Heat</ENAMEX>.â€
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> point of fascination is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carnot</ENAMEX> carried out his crucial analysis just as steam was becoming established as a source of mechanical work. It is almost certainly not a coincidence that the impulse to investigate the central nature of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> arises just as we are on the threshold of creating such molecular systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>, technology, and art tumble into the adjacent possible in roughly equal and yoked pace.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX> shows the essentials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnotâ</ENAMEX>€™s idealized machine. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> heat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hotter than the other, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1 > T2</TIMEX>. Between the two heat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX> is a cylinder with a piston inside. The space between the top of the piston and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the cylinder is filled with an idealized â€œworking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>,â€ which can be compressed and can expand. As a real, and certainly an idealized, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is compressed, the gas becomes hotter; as the gas expands, it becomes cooler.
I will modify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Carnot</ENAMEX> machine in one central way, which does not alter but rather makes explicit an important feature of the actual working of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Carnot</ENAMEX> machine. I will attach a red handle to the cylinder, as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.1</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle begins with the piston pressed up near the top of the cylinder, the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is compressed and hot, indeed, it is as hot as the high temperature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1</TIMEX>. You will operate the machine. You pull on the red handle, sliding the cylinder (frictionlessly) into contact with the high-temperature reservoir, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1</TIMEX>. You then let go of the red handle and allow the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in the cylinder to expand, thereby pushing the piston downward away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the cylinder, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the power stroke of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine.
As the power stroke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">initiates</ENAMEX>, the working gas expands and starts to cool. However, thanks to the fact that the cylinder is now in contact with the hot thermal reservoir, heat flows into the cylinder from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1</TIMEX> and maintains the working gas almost at the constant temperature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1</TIMEX>. Indeed, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine is operated slowly enough, the temperature remains constant. Such slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> is said to be reversible. If the engine is operated more rapidly, hence irreversibly, the temperature is held nearly constant during this part of the power stroke, thus this section of the power stroke is called the â€œisothermal expansion portionâ€ of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> work cycle.
It is not only convenient but central to understanding a Carnot engine to plot the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the system in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartesian</ENAMEX> coordinate system in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis corresponds to the volume of the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, while the y-axis corresponds to the pressure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>). The work cycle began with the piston near the top of the cylinder, the working gas hot and compressed. As the isothermal expansion phase of the power stroke happens, the pressure falls slightly, while the volume increases appreciably. The corresponding segment of the work cycle connects the starting position in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>, position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>, to position 2 by a line <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> representing the simultaneous values of volume and pressure during the isothermal expansion part of the power <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>.
You initiate the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of the power stroke by pushing on the handle and moving the cylinder out of contact with the hot T1 reservoir to a position between the two heat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX>, touching neither. You immediately let go of the handle. The working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> continues to expand, pushing downward on the piston and moving it away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the cylinder. However, because the cylinder is out of contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T1</ENAMEX> and the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is expanding, the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> gets noticeably cooler, so pressure drops appreciably while volume increases slightly. This part of the power stroke is called â€œadiabatic expansion.â€ In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>, the adiabatic expansion step carries the system from step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the end of the power stroke, a point where the pressure is at the lowest point, and the volume of the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is at the highest point of the work cycle.
Now in order to return the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine to its initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>), such that the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> can again expand and do mechanical work on the piston, work must be done on the engine to bring the piston back up to its position near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the cylinder and to recompress and reheat the working gas so that its temperature and pressure values, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, correspond to state <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. If the work done on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine simply retraced the exact pathway from step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, at least as much work would have to be done on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine as the engine released in the power stroke in going from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 2 to 3</TIMEX>. If so, no net work would be carried out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine on the external world.
Instead of retracing the power stroke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine, and all heat engines, use a simple trick. You will do it. At step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the end of the power stroke, you push on the handle, pushing the cylinder into contact with the low-temperature reservoir, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX>. Indeed, you have arranged things such that at the end of the power stroke the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is itself at this lower temperature, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX>.
With the cylinder in contact with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX>, you now run around to the base of the cylinder, where a stout handle is attached to the piston and extends beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cylinderâ€™s base</ENAMEX>. You push on the handle, pushing the piston upward in the cylinder, thereby compressing the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. As you do this work on the piston, the compressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> tends to heat up. But thanks to contact with the low-temperature reservoir, the heat generated by compression in the working gas diVuses into the cool T2 reservoir, holding the working gas only slightly warmer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX>. Thus volume decreases appreciably, while pressure increases slightly.
The point of this trick is that it requires less work to compress a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> that remains cool than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that heats up. Because the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is held at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly</NUMEX> a constant temperature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX>, this part of the compression <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">â€œisothermal compression</ENAMEX>,â€ and it carries the system in its volume-pressure state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> from position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>.
At the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">isothermal compression stroke</ENAMEX>, you do your part again. You pull on the handle, pulling the cylinder out of contact with the cool T2 reservoir to a position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between T2 and T1</TIMEX>, touching neither. Then you return to push on the handle connected to the piston, further compressing the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. Due to the compression of the working gas and the fact that it is not in contact with the cool T1 reservoir, the working gas heats up, so the pressure increases appreciably while the volume decreases slightly, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is compressed until the initial state of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compressed gas</ENAMEX>, step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, is achieved. The work cycle is now complete. The connected set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> lines in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>, from step <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 1</TIMEX>, depicts the sequence of pressure volume <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the working gas around the work cycle.
I have emphasized the role of you and the red handle in carrying us through the work cycle. In a real engine, of course, the role of the red handle is carried out by various gears, rods, escapements, and other mechanical devices that serve an essential role: The handle and you, or the gears, rods, and escapements, literally organize the flow of the recurrent process. I will return to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the flow of process in a machine or an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle is involved with the organized release of thermal energy in achieving recurrent mechanical work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of work is essentialÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL"> =Â and</ENAMEX> will be centralÂ =Â to thinking about what occurs in an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Indeed, part of what we need is a way of characterizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of real processes in the nonequilibrium world. I do not think we have, as yet, an adequate concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> question I want to raise about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle is this: Why is it a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œcycleâ€</ENAMEX>? There is a clear sensible answer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle operates in a cycle, as does a steam engine, gasoline engine, or electric motor, precisely because at the completion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cycle the total system is returned to the same initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> as at the start of the cycle. Because of this, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the process, achieved by the actual gears, rods, and escapements that coordinate the relative motion of the parts of the engine, has returned to the initial configuration from which, with no further ado, the system can again perform a work cycle. Thus in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> performs mechanical work on the piston in a work cycle that, in net, transfers heat from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir. At the end of the cycle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine returns to the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with the piston raised and filled with hot compressed gas at the temperature of the hot reservoir. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine is all set as a total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to receive another input of heat energy and perform another work cycle.
Suppose that there were no cycle? For example, a cannon fires a cannonball that hits a standing steel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> that is knocked over and hits a lever arm tossing a ball on its opposite end into the air which then falls to the ground and stops. To get the contraption to do it again would require that somehow the cannon be reloaded, the steel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> be reset on end, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lever arm</ENAMEX> to be reset with a ball on its other end. Where is all this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of processes and events to come from? I will return to these issues in the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, but notice for now that the cyclic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of processes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX>, the steam, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, and the electric engines achieve the requisite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> precisely because the system works as a cyclic process. 
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> issue concerns a well-known feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine that is very much worth comment here. If the sequence of steps is run in the reverse directions, so that the engine is run from state <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine is not performing as a pump at all. It is, instead, performing as a refrigerator. Run in the reverse direction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine uses mechanical work to pump heat from the cool reservoir, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T2</TIMEX>, to the hot reservoir, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T1</TIMEX>, making T2 cooler.
Now, heat does not spontaneously flow from cooler to hotter objects, making the cooler objects even cooler. So <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points leap to attention here. First, the same device, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine, can be a pump or be a refrigerator, depending upon the order of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. In fact, I am cheating a bit, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of gears and escapements would <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diVer</ENAMEX> in achieving the sequence of states <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3, 4, 1 versus 1, 4, 3, 2, 1</ENAMEX>. But essentially the same machine can perform <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very diVerent functions, or tasks, pumping in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case, cooling in the other.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> point, of course, concerns spontaneous processes and nonspontaneous processes. It took more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnotâ</ENAMEX>€™s work to really begin to understand thermodynamicsÂ =Â the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> law, conservation of energy; the famous and mysterious <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law and its handmaiden, entropy; the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> law concerning a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> temperature at which molecular motions <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stopÂ =Â and</ENAMEX> for the invention of statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> to connect thermodynamics and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newtonian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX>.
Some processes occur spontaneously, some conceivable processes do not. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most obvious cases is that if a hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> is in contact with a cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> will in due course come to be the same temperature. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Heat spontaneously â€œdiVusesâ€</ENAMEX> from the hot to the cold object, cooling the former, warming the latter. In statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> we think of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">â€œhotâ€</ENAMEX> as corresponding to atoms moving rapidly, hence, with high kinetic energy. When these high-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">kinetic</NUMEX>-energy atoms interact with slower-moving sets of atoms, the collisions transfer kinetic energy to the slower-moving atoms, speeding them up and slowing down the faster-moving atoms. Eventually, the atoms in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets come to have the same statistical distribution of motions, hence kinetic energy and hence temperature, where â€œtemperatureâ€ is now understood to correspond to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the system.
The apparently mysterious <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system is either constant or increases. The modern understanding of entropy can be stated roughly with the help of the concept of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6N-dimensional</NUMEX> phase space. 
Consider an isolated closed thermodynamic system, say, an ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in a thermos bottle. Let there be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> gas particles in the bottle. Now, each particle is in motion in real three-dimensional space; therefore, we can pick an arbitrary three-dimensional coordinate system, with length, width, and height (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">x, y, and z</ENAMEX>). We can note the current position of any particular particle in the bottle at any moment on each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> positional coordinates. In addition to having a position, each particle may be in motion, it may have a velocity and an associated momentum in some direction in the bottle. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newtonâ</ENAMEX>€™s vectorial composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> rules, we can decompose the motion of the real particle into its motions in the x direction, the y direction, and the z direction. The momentum in each of these directions is just the mass of the particle times its velocity in that direction. Newtonâ€™s vector composition rule says that we can recover the motion of the initial particle by constructing the obvious parallelogram that adds the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x, y</ENAMEX>, and z velocity or momentum vectors back together.
So for each particle we can represent its position and momentum in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> spatial directions by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> numbers. We have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> particles in the bottle, so we can represent the current positions and momenta of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> particles at any instant in time by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6N</TIMEX> numbers. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DiVerent</ENAMEX> combinations of positions and velocities now correspond to diVerent sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6N</ENAMEX> numbers. And, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> particles in the bottle collide and exchange momenta, bouncing oV in new combinations of directions with new combinations of velocities according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newtonâ</ENAMEX>€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> laws of motion, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6N</TIMEX> numbers representing the system at each moment change in time through some succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6N</ENAMEX> numbers. If we think of all the possible values of the positions and velocities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> particles in the bottle, that set of possible values is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6N-dimensional</TIMEX> phase space of our system. The system starts at some single combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6N</ENAMEX> numbers, hence a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the phase space. Over time, as positions and momenta change, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6N</TIMEX> numbers change and the system flows along a trajectory in phase space.
Now here is the heart of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law: Some of the positions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6N-dimensional</TIMEX> phase space correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in which all the particles are more or less uniformly spread throughout the bottle and are moving with more or less the same velocities. Other positions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6N-dimensional</TIMEX> phase space correspond to unusual situations, in which all the particles are located near the top of the bottle, are along the walls of the bottle, are moving in the same direction in the bottle, and so forth.
Consider mathematically breaking up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 6N-dimensional</TIMEX> phase space into a very large number of tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6N-dimensional â€œcubesâ€</ENAMEX> that together add up to the entire <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">6N</NUMEX>-dimensional phase space. If the cubes are small enough, then each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> corresponds to a quite similar set of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. One cube might correspond to all the particles flowing downward in the bottle, another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> might correspond to a near uniform distribution of positions and momenta.
It is easy to see intuitively that there are many more combinations of positions and momenta that correspond to nearly uniform positions of the particles and their motions scattered in all possible directions than there are combinations of positions and momenta that correspond to all the particles being located in a specific small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the bottle. In order to quantify this intuition, statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> counts the numbers of small 6N-dimensional cubes corresponding to each such â€œmacroscopicâ€ state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. Vastly many more small cubes correspond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œmacrostateâ€</ENAMEX> in which particles are nearly uniformly distributed and are moving in all the possible directions with velocities bunched around an average velocityÂ<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE"> =Â hence kinetic energyÂ =Â than</ENAMEX> for any other macrostate, such as the macrostate corresponding to all the particles being located near the top of the bottle.
We are almost home free. We need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">premiseÂ =Â the famous â€œergodic hypothesis</ENAMEX>.â€ This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX> asserts that the trajectory of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> leading from the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in a long stringlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œwalkâ€</ENAMEX> will, over time, spend as much time in any small <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6N cube</NUMEX> as in any other <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX>. In short, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ergodic hypothesis assertsÂ =Â indeed</ENAMEX>, assumesÂ =Â that the system will wander around its phase space such that after a long time it will have spent as large a fraction of its time in any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tiny <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> as any other <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX>.
But now we are home free. Since vastly many more small cubes correspond to the nearly uniform distribution of particles, moving in all possible directions but bunched around an average velocity, it follows from the ergodic hypothesis that the system will have spent most of its time in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">â€œequilibriumâ€ macrostate</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law, in its modern understanding, is simply the statement that an isolated thermodynamic system will tend to flow away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">improbable macrostatesÂ =Â corresponding</ENAMEX> to very few of our tiny 6N-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cubesÂ =Â and</ENAMEX> flow into and spend most of its time in the equilibrium macrostate for no better reason than that that macrostate corresponds to vastly many small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">6N cubes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire 6N-dimensional</TIMEX> phase space. The increase of entropy in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law is nothing but the tendency of systems to flow from less probable to more probable macrostates.
The physical concept of entropy of a macrostate is understood, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ludwig Boltzmann</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last century</TIMEX>, to be proportional to the logarithm of the number of small 6N-dimensional cubes that correspond to that macrostate. The increase of entropy in spontaneous processes is then the tendency to flow from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrostates</ENAMEX> comprised of a small numbers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6N-dimensional</TIMEX> cubes, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œmicrostates,â€ to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">macrostates</ENAMEX> comprised of a very many microstates.
Our next step in thinking about autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> requires us to consider again the concept of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œcatalytic task spaceâ€</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of autocatalytic sets in the context of catalytic task space. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> chapter I described the basic framework, due to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Perelson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Oster</ENAMEX>, of an abstract shape space, where each point would represent a molecular shape. Shape space has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the three spatial</TIMEX> dimensions of length, height, and width, but in addition it has properties reflecting the features of clusters of atoms that contribute to an eVective molecular shape, that is, to those features that collectively might be â€œrecognizedâ€ by another molecule that bound the shape in question. Such additional molecular features may include electric charge, dipole moment, hydrophobicity, or other features. At present, it is a reasonable guess that shape space is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between five</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> dimensional. If true, this would not mean that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> familiar features, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> spatial and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> others, that constitute the dimensions of shape space. Rather, some odd combination of several physical propertiesÂ =Â partially charge, partially dipole moment, or partially hydrophobicity and partially dipole momentÂ =Â might be the dimensions that matter.
In any case, we are to consider a bounded shape space with maximum and minimum values for each axis. A shape is a point in shape space. Thus, a molecular feature on a virus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, an epitope, is a point in shape space. An <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> might bind that epitope and a family of similar shapes filling a ball in shape space. As remarked above, very diVerent molecules can have eVectively the same shape, so endorphin and morphine both bind the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endorphin receptor</ENAMEX>. A finite number of balls will â€œcoverâ€ shape space, and the immune repertoire of perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred million</NUMEX> antibodies may well cover shape space.
Catalytic task space, you recall, simply applied the concept of shape space to catalysis. A point in catalytic task space now represents a catalytic task. A given chemical reaction constitutes a catalytic task. As in shape space, similar reactions constitute similar catalytic tasks. As in shape space, diVerent reactions can constitute essentially the same catalytic task. An enzyme covers some ball in catalytic task space, comprising the set of reactions it can catalyze. And as noted before, according to transition state theory a catalytic task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corresponds</ENAMEX> to a catalyst binding the distorted, hence high-energy, molecular configuration corresponding to the transition state of a reaction with high aYnity and binding the substrate and product <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> with, in general, lower aYnity.
In terms of catalytic task space, what is a collectively autocatalytic set? Consider a simple case. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> peptides, A and B, form a collectively autocatalytic set if A catalyzes the formation of B from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bâ</ENAMEX>€™s fragments, while B catalyzes A from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ</ENAMEX>€™s fragments. Then consider two balls in catalytic task space, the first ball, covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX>, constitutes the catalytic task in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments of B are ligated to form B. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> ball, covered by B, constitutes the catalytic task in task space in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments of A are ligated to form A.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> feature of a collectively autocatalytic set is what I call â€œcatalytic closure.â€ Every reaction that must find a catalyst, does find a catalyst. The formation of A requires B, and the formation of B requires A. It is important to notice that this closure in catalytic task space is not â€œlocalâ€; there is no single reaction in this collectively autocatalytic set that by itself constitutes the closure in question. In a clear sense, the catalytic closure is a property of the whole system.
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> feature to notice is that A and B as catalysts do not by themselves constitute the closure in question; A and B might catalyze a variety of reactions. In particular, if B is presented with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> â€œproperâ€ fragments of A, call them <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€™</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€</ENAMEX>, then B will ligate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€™</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aâ€™â€™</ENAMEX> to form A. But if B were presented with other substrates, say Q and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, then B might catalyze a reaction transforming Q and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Similarly</ENAMEX>, A, as a catalyst, will ligate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> proper fragments of B, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bâ€™</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bâ€™â€™</ENAMEX> to form <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">B. But A</ENAMEX>, if confronted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other substrates, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>, might catalyze their ligation to form a single <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> molecule, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX>
While the set A, B, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€™</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bâ€™</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bâ€™â€™</ENAMEX> is collectively autocatalytic, forming more A and B from a substrate pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€™</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bâ€™</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bâ€</ENAMEX>, it is not the case that the set A, B, Q, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> is collectively autocatalytic, for the products of the reactions catalyzed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> and B, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S, T</ENAMEX>, and H, are not themselves the catalysts A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX>
In short, the closure of catalytic tasks requires specification of the catalytic tasks themselves plus the specific substrates whose products, here A and B, constitute the very catalysts that carry out the catalytic tasks in question.
The closure of an autocatalytic set and set of catalytic tasks has a kind of dualism. From the point of view of the molecules involved, the specific catalytic tasks constitute the avenues of release of chemical energy by which the molecular system reproduces itself. The tasks coordinate the flow of atoms among the molecules whereby the set reforms itself. From the point of view of the tasks, the molecular species manage to carry out the tasks repeatedly, with no further molecular species being necessary to carry out the tasks. The molecules carry out the tasks, the tasks coordinate, or organize, the processes among the molecules.
The coordination aVorded by the catalytic tasks that are jointly present and fulfilled is highlighted if we recall that, in general, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€™</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€</ENAMEX>, might undergo a variety of diVerent reactions that form, in addition to A, perhaps E, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M, P</ENAMEX>, and other molecular species. The specific catalytic task that carries <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aâ€™ and Aâ€™â€™ to A</ENAMEX> in the presence of a catalyst, B, speeds that specific reaction in comparison to the alternative reactions forming E, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Thus</ENAMEX>, the closure of the catalytic tasks, substrates and catalysts, A, B, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€™</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bâ€™</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bâ€</ENAMEX>, achieves a coordination, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, of the flow of matter and energy into the autocatalytic system.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> achieved by the closure of catalytic tasks is similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> achieved by the gears and escapements together with the rest of the idealized Carnot engine. The flow of process is marshaled into an organized whole. In the case of the autocatalytic set, the set reproduces itself. It also seems worth stressing that this closure in catalytic task space is a new concept with real physical meaning. It is a matter of objective fact whether or not a physical reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> achieves catalytic closure; the hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> system above, and any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, achieves catalytic closure.
A final preliminary will bring us to our attempted definition of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. This preliminary is based on the distinction, noted above, between spontaneous and nonspontaneous chemical reactions. At equilibrium, the net rate of formation or destruction of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, aside from small fluctuations that damp out. Thus, if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>, interconvert, the equilibrium is attained at that ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> concentrations at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">converts</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> as fast as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> converts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> If the reaction is displaced in one direction, say there is a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> concentration than the equilibrium ratio, then the spontaneous, or exergonic, reaction proceeds in the direction toward equilibrium that reduces the excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> concentration (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX>).
All spontaneous chemical reactions, if coupled to no other source of energy, are exergonic. On the other hand, if some other free energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> is coupled to the reaction, the reaction can be driven â€œbeyond equilibriumâ€ by using some of the energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Reactions that are driven beyond equilibrium by addition of free energy are called endergonic. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> might convert to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>, and this reaction might be coupled to another source of free energy, such that the steady state concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> is much higher than the normal equilibrium <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> ratio (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX>).
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle, completion of the work cycle involved the cylinder piston system doing exergonic work on the external world during the power stroke, then the outside world doing work on the cylinder piston system when you pushed on the piston to recompress the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle links mechanical and thermal energy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> into a work cycle. A chemical reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with a work cycle will have to link spontaneous, exergonic and nonspontaneous, endergonic reactions into the chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">analogue</ENAMEX> of a work cycle. Like the cyclic Carnot engine, the chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">analogue</ENAMEX> will have to work in a cycle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3, 4, 1</ENAMEX> cycle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle. Further, in order for the cycle to operate at a finite rate, hence irreversibly, the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> must be an open thermodynamic system driven by outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of matter or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">energyÂ =Â hence â€œfoodâ€Â =Â</ENAMEX> and the continual driving of the system by such â€œfoodâ€ holds the system away from equilibrium.
In this light, think again of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghadiri</ENAMEX> autocatalytic system, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence A that ligates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fragments <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€™</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid fragment</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid fragment</ENAMEX>, into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> This reaction is purely exergonic. The reaction proceeds from the substrate fragments <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aâ€™</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aâ€™â€™</ENAMEX> to form the product molecule A and approaches the equilibrium ratio of substrates to product. Ghadiriâ€™s autocatalytic system is wonderful, but merely exergonic. It does not achieve a work cycle. In general, autocatalytic and collectively autocatalytic systems can be purely exergonic. In any such case, no work cycle is achieved.
Now we can return to my jumped-to definition: An autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is a reproducing system that carries out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> thermodynamic work cycle. That <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, sculling up the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX>, flagellum flailing in work cycles, is busy as hell doing â€œit,â€ reproducing and carrying out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more work cycles. So too are all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. We do, in blunt fact, link spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes in richly webbed pathways of interaction that achieve reproduction and the persistent work cycles by which we act on the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beavers</ENAMEX> do build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX>; yet beavers are â€œjustâ€ physical systems.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reza Ghadiriâ</ENAMEX>€™s example of an autocatalytic peptide doesnâ€™t make the grade, nor does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gunter von Kiedrowskiâ</ENAMEX>€™s autocatalytic hexamer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> or collectively autocatalytic set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA hexamers</ENAMEX>. All these systems are merely exergonic. No work cycle is performed.
Now that we have stated our proposed definition of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, it is not too hard to imagine a chemical realization. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> I show a hypothetical molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Given visualization of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case, I expect that we will be constructing molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX>, our first example of a candidate molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, is â€œconstructedâ€ to link with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> further molecular systems, the exergonic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX>-catalytic system developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gunter von Kiedrowski</ENAMEX> based on ligation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> trimers by their complementary hexamer. Here, the hexamer is simplified to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCCGGG5â€™</TIMEX>, and the two complementary trimers are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™GGG3â€™</TIMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCC3â€™</TIMEX>. Left to its own devices, this reaction is exergonic and, in the presence of excess trimers compared to the equilibrium ratio of hexamer to trimers, will flow exergonically toward equilibrium by synthesizing the hexamer. Because the hexamer is itself the catalyst for the reaction, the synthesis of hexamer is autocatalytic.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> consists in pyrophosphate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX>, a high-energy dimer of monophosphate that breaks down to form <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> monophosphates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> + P. Like any reaction, the reaction converting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> has an equilibrium, hence an equilibrium ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> and P. In the presence of excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PP</ENAMEX> compared to equilibrium, the reaction flows toward equilibrium by the spontaneous cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to yield P + <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.</ENAMEX>
My purpose in invoking the exergonic conversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P + P</ENAMEX> is to utilize the loss of free energy in this exergonic reaction to drive the DNA trimer-hexamer reaction beyond its own equilibrium, leading thereby to an excess synthesis of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX>€™CCCGGG5â€™ hexamer when compared to its equilibrium concentration. Thus, the excess synthesis of the hexamer, which would not occur spontaneously, is driven endergonically by being coupled to the exergonic breakdown of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX>). In short, the exergonic breakdown of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P + P supplies the free energy to drive the excess buildup of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX>€™CCCGGG5â€™ concentration beyond its own equilibrium with respect to its trimer substrates, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™GGG3â€™</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCC3â€™</TIMEX>.
The excess synthesis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX>€™CCCGGG5â€™ constitutes excess reproduction of the hexamer autocatalytic reaction product beyond that which would occur without the coupling to the additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> free energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Thus, the system is reproducing â€œbetterâ€ with the coupling to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> than without the coupling.
Another point to note is that the coupling of the breakdown of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P + P with the excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer compared to the equilibrium concentration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA hexamer</ENAMEX> means that energy is stored within the system. This is true because the excess concentration of the hexamer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, compared to its equilibrium, could in principle be released by degradation of the hexamer to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trimer substrates, releasing that stored free energy as this reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> flowed toward its own equilibrium ratio of hexamer and trimers. Thus, the coupling to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P + P reaction means that the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent stores</ENAMEX> energy internally. Later in evolution, such internally stored energy can be used to drive reactions that correct errors, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> repair in contemporary cells. I am glad to thank <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Anderson</ENAMEX> and, indirectly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hopfield</ENAMEX> for this point.
Once the pyrophosphate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX>, is cleaved to form P + P, as this reaction flows toward its own equilibrium ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P, that free energy is used up. In order to have a renewed internal supply of the free energy needed to synthesize excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hexamer</ENAMEX>, it is convenient to resynthesize pyrophosphate from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> monophosphates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Iâ</ENAMEX>€™ll return below to the meaning of â€œconvenient,â€ for in a general sense, the convenience reflects the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of processes that sustains an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is not convenient, it is essential.
Resynthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">P + P</ENAMEX> requires the addition of free energy. This is true because we used the exergonic breakdown of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P + P to drive the excess synthesis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCCGGG5â€™</TIMEX>. Now we need to add energy to resynthesize PP from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. To</ENAMEX> do so, I invoke an additional source of free energy in the form of an electron, e, which absorbs a photon, hv; is driven endergonically to an excited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, e*, and falls back exergonically to its low-energy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, e, in a reaction that is coupled to the synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P.</ENAMEX>
The point of this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> reaction-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> is clear: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> is resynthesized from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P + P</ENAMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> can continue to drive the excess synthesis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA hexamer</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCCGGG5â€™</TIMEX>. Overall, the total system of linked reactions is exergonicÂ =Â there is an overall loss of free energy that is ultimately supplied by the incoming photon, hv, plus the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> substrates, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™GGG3â€™</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCC3â€™</TIMEX>. Thus, we are not cheating the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law.
Letâ€™s return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle, where I had you pushing and pulling on the handle and on the piston itself during the work cycle. We noted that in a real engine you would not be busy pushing and pulling. Your role in organizing the processes would be taken by gears, escapements, rods, connectors, bearings, and other bits of machinery.
I now invoke the analogue of the gears, rods, and connectors in the form of hypothetical molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couplings</ENAMEX> that control the reactions I have already invoked. Specifically, I will assume that the hexamer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCCGGG5â€™</TIMEX>, is the catalyst that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> ligation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trimers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™GGG3â€™</TIMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCC3â€™</TIMEX>, to the exergonic breakdown of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P + P. My second assumption is that monophosphate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>, binds to the hexamer and facilitates the reaction. Thus, I am assuming that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> is an allosteric enhancer of the reaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€œAllostericâ€</ENAMEX> means that P binds to a site on the enzyme, here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the hexamer</TIMEX>, other than the hexamerâ€™s own binding site for the substrates. Allosteric enhancers and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are common in biological systems. 
Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> might bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-phosphate backbone of the DNA hexamer. This coupling implies that as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> breaks down to form P + P, the monophosphate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>, will feed back to further activate the hexamer enzyme, making the catalysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hexamer</ENAMEX> formation even more rapid. Just such a positive feedback of a reaction product on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzyme</ENAMEX> forming it occurs in the famous glycolytic pathway that is the core of metabolism in your cells. In fact, under appropriate experimental conditions, this positive feedback coupling can cause the glycolytic pathway to undergo sustained temporal oscillations in the concentrations of the glycolytic metabolites.
Finally, I will invoke a few more couplings. I assume that one of the trimers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCC3â€™</TIMEX>, is the catalyst that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> the exergonic loss of free energy from the activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron</ENAMEX>, e* to e, with the resynthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> + P. And I invoke an allosteric inhibition of this catalysis by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> itself. Thus, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> is in high concentration, it tends to inhibit its own resynthesis. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> concentration falls, the inhibition on PP resynthesis is removed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> is resynthesized. The whole molecular contraption, our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hypothetical autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX>.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the first things to note about our hypothetical autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is that it constitutes a previously unstudied class of chemical reaction networks. The behavior of exergonic autocatalytic and cross-catalytic systems is beginning to be studied. The behavior of linked exergonic and endergonic reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> is the very stuV of intermediate metabolism and energyâ€™s biochemical transduction, studied for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> by biochemists. But, to date, no one has begun to study linked reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in which autocatalysis is coupled to linked exergonic and energonic reactions. So we are entering an entirely new domain.
Thus, our molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> constitutes a system with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> essential features of living systems, self-reproduction and metabolism. However, my insistence that an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> carries out a work cycle refines the generally understood concept of a metabolism to include the requirement that the metabolism carries out a work cycle.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> feature to note is that our autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is, necessarily, a nonequilibrium system. Free energy, here in the form of the photon, hv, and the trimer substrates is taken in and used to drive the linked synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> and excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA hexamer</ENAMEX>. There is no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> at equilibrium. The excess synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> hexamer constitutes excess replication of the hexamer by virtue of the coupling of the trimer-hexamer synthesis to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP ïƒ· P</ENAMEX> + P cycle of reactions, which, as noted next, constitute a â€œchemical engine.â€
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> feature to note is the work cycle performed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. The simplest way of seeing the work cycle here is in the behavior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP ïƒ· P</ENAMEX> + P reaction. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle, the working gas cycles from compressed and hot to less compressed and cool, back to compressed and hot. In our hypothetical autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, there is a macroscopic cycle of matter from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> to P + P via the reaction- forming <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA hexamer</ENAMEX> and back around to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> via the reaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">high-energy electron</ENAMEX>. The macroscopic cycling of matter around this cycle is the engine at work. (I am grateful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Wills</ENAMEX> for this clarification of the concept of a chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor</ENAMEX>.) In addition, depending upon the details of the kinetic constants, our autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> may literally show an oscillatory concentration cycle in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> concentration begins high and falls as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P + P</ENAMEX> is formed, then the high PP concentration is reformed by use of the photon-energized exergonic e* ïƒ· e reaction. 
Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PP ïƒ·ï€ P</ENAMEX> + P reaction embedded in the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> constitutes a chemical engine in which there is a macroscopic net flux of matter around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP ïƒ· P</ENAMEX> + P cycle, which is operating displaced from equilibrium as it is driven by addition of energy from the photon, hv, and addition of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA trimers</ENAMEX>, and as energy is drained oV to drive excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> thing to note about the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is that, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine, the steam engine, the gas engine, and the electric engine, the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> works in a cycle. At the end of the cycle the system is poised to cycle again. A repeating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of process is achieved. And next, just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engine run backward is a refrigerator and not a pump, if the reactions of the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> were run backward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP ïƒ· P</ENAMEX> + P engine would run in the reverse direction. This is because all reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> would be displaced from equilibrium the opposite way and the analogue of throwing the gears in reverse, namely reversing in sign the positive and negative activator and inhibitor couplings to the two proper enzymes, would convert the excess energy stored in the above equilibrium concentration of hexamer into production of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trimers and the resynthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> + P. Were the release of the photon, hv, a readily reversible step, the excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> would drive emission of a photon by the excited electron, thus returning the electron to the initial unexcited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
In short, if the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is run backward, the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> melts down into its foodstuV. Run backward, the system is not an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, for it does not reproduce itself and perform a work cycle. Run backward, the system is a flashlight!
Does the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> work? The answer is yes. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Daley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Girvin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Wills</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Yamins</ENAMEX> and I have simulated the system of diVerential equations that correspond to the dynamics of this autonomous-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> molecular reaction network. The diVerential equations represent the way the concentration of each chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> changes over time as a function of its own and other chemical concentrations. In general in such mathematical models, a number of unchanging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constants</ENAMEX> representing kinetic constants and other parameters enter into the diVerential equations. In the present case, the diVerential equation system has thirteen such parameters. 
The model autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent system</ENAMEX> is displaced from equilibrium by the persistent addition of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA trimers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™GGG3â€™</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5â</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">€™CCC3â€™</TIMEX>, the removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA hexamer</ENAMEX>, and the persistent shining of photons, hv, from the outside. The chemical reaction network occurs under â€œchemostatâ€ conditions. This means that all molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of the system are treated mathematically as if they were in a real well-stirred container to which the trimers and photons are added at a constant rate. In addition, the hexamer molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are removed from the system at an adjustable rate that holds their internal concentrations constant whatever the rate of reproduction of hexamer may be.
The autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent system</ENAMEX> reproduces more eYciently with the couplings of the DNA trimer-hexamer system to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">electron cycles</ENAMEX> than in the purely exergonic case in which the DNA trimer-hexamer system operates alone. We measured eYciency thermodynamically as the conversion of available free energy coming into the system from the photon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> into the excess hexamer with respect to the undriven steady-state rate of reaction concentration of the hexamer.
Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> shows the results of our simulations. In these simulations of the chemical reaction network, there are, as noted, thirteen kinetic constants. We carried out computer selection experiments not only comparing the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> to a nude exergonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> trimer-hexamer system, but also computationally mutating the kinetic constants by small amounts and computationally evolving autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to reproduce with higher thermodynamic eYciency.
Our results demonstrate <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and most important that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> operating displaced from equilibrium and utilizing a work cycle can be more eYcient at using the available free energy coming into the total system in reproducing hexamer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> than in the absence of the coupling of the trimer-hexamer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> system to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> and electron-photon work cycle system. Thus, the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> as a whole, including its work cycle, reproduces <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA hexamer</ENAMEX> more rapidly than would the trimer-hexamer exergonic system alone. In short, and also important, being an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> coupling an autocatalytic system with a work cycle is of selective advantage compared to being a merely exergonic autocatalytic system.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, just as in the glycolytic positive-feedback case, our autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> model, for appropriate values of the kinetic constants, can undergo sustained temporal oscillations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> and other concentrations. The oscillation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PP</ENAMEX> from high concentration to low concentration then back to high concentration during the work cycle is analogous to the expansion and recompression oscillation of the working <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> engineâ€™s work cycle.
<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, a mountainous fitness landscape exists in the mathematical parameter space of the thirteen kinetic constants, in which some values of the kinetic constants lead to higher eYciency of reproduction than others. Darwinâ€™s natural selection could, in principle, operate if there were heritable variation in the kinetic constants.
The main conclusion to draw from our simulation is that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> coupling one or more autocatalytic and work cycles are a perfectly reasonable, if novel, form of nonequilibrium, open chemical reaction network. There is no hocus pocus here. In the near future we will almost certainly construct such autonomous-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> molecular reaction networks and study their dynamics and evolutionary behavior. A general biology is, in fact, around the corner.
The hypothetical molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> that we have considered has been discussed, for simplicity, as if the problem of retaining the reactants in a confined region of space could be ignored. In fact, this assumption is an idealization. Were our autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in a dilute solution, the rates of reaction would be very slow. Actual creation of a functioning molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> will require that the reacting molecular species be confined to a small volume or a surface or in some other fashion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Candidates</ENAMEX> for isolation to small volumes include micelles and liposomes. Both macromolecular aggregated structures are comprised of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œamphipathic</ENAMEX> molecules,â€ that is, molecules with hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions such as lipids. Micelles are single-layered structures which, in an aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> have hydrophilic regions directed outward, but are able to enclose an aqueous core in which the other molecular species of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> might reside. In an aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, liposomes form double-layered membranes, homologous to cell membranes, with hydrophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> in the aqueous medium and hydrophobic tails abutted. In an aqueous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, both micelles and liposomes can form and even reproduce by budding. A full-fledged molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> would have to synthesize the lipid or similar molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX> of its bounding surface and coordinate budding with dispersion of autocatalytic and work cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> vesicles.
An alternative to isolation of the autocatalytic and work cycle molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> within a bounding volume is the confinement of such reacting species to a surface. Such confinement has the further advantage of altering diVusive search by reactants from a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>- to a two-dimensional search process. The latter can shift the corresponding chemical equilibrium toward synthesis of larger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> from their smaller substates. Here one can imagine confinement of reactants and products to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay surfaces</ENAMEX> or confinement of complex organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactants</ENAMEX> and products to the surfaces of the abundant dust particles in giant molecular clouds in galaxies.
I will have much more to say in subsequent chapters about the properties of molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. In particular, in order to understand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> we will have to carry out a critique of the physicistâ€™s concept of â€œwork,â€ as in a work cycle, for the best understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œworkâ€</ENAMEX> appears to be that work is the constrained release of energy. Yet the very constraints on the release of energy that are essential to the doing of work themselves constitute the analogues of the gears, rods, connectors, and escapements of an ordinary machine. Most important, it typically takes work itself to construct the constraints on the release of energy that then constitutes work. In our first example of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX>, these constraints are present in the invoked couplings of catalysts and allosteric eVectors to the reactions of which the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is comprised. I have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hunchÂ =Â a deep hunch verging on convictionÂ =Â</ENAMEX> that the coherent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the construction of sets of constraints on the release of energy which constitutes the work by which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> build further constraints on the release of energy that in due course literally build a second copy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> itself, is a new concept, the proper formulation of which will be a proper concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œorganization</ENAMEX>.â€
In the meantime, if I am right, what did <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SchrÃ¶dinger</ENAMEX> miss? He was right about his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">microcodeÂ =Â the microcode</ENAMEX> will reemerge as a subset of the constraints on the release of energy by which an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> builds a rough copy of itself. Namely, the microcode is the very structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, which serves as constraints on the enzymes that then transcribe and translate the code. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SchrÃ¶dinger</ENAMEX> missed stating the requirement for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> to be nonequilibrium. On the other hand, displacement from equilibrium is a necessary condition for a microcode to do anything at all. So perhaps displacement from equilibrium was implicit in his theme. More important, I think, is that he missed the concept that an agent is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> of an autocatalytic system that does one or more work cycles. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> is a new kind of dynamical system.
Now that we have seen an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, I find myself wondering whether autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> may constitute a proper definition of life itself. I make no attempt to defend my own strong intuition that the answer is yes. I suspect that the concept of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> as an autocatalytic system carrying out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more work cycles defines life. If so, here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the elusive core of life, that examination of the molecular chunks of cells does not reveal. Most of the remainder of this book is devoted to examining the unexpected unfoldings of this tentative definition of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and, perhaps, life. But I certainly will not insist upon my intuition. It suYces at this stage to note that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living systems we knowÂ =Â single-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, single-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotic cells</ENAMEX>, and multicelled organismsÂ =Â fulfill my definition of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
If Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> shows us a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> case of a molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, how broad a family of systems does the concept of an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> embrace? I confess I do not know. Clearly, there is nothing in the concept of a reproducing system that carries out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> thermodynamic work cycle that limits such a system to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. As we have seen, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Rebek</ENAMEX> has already created self-reproducing organic molecules well outside the familiar classes of biopolymers. If no such reproducing molecular system yet enfolds a thermodynamic work cycle, that is not to say that we shall long be stalled in creating such systems. It seems plausible that wide classes of chemical reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> can fulfill the criteria I have traced above. But must autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> be â€œmolecularâ€ in the familiar sense? Could mutually gravitating systems such as galaxies fulfill the criteria? What of systems made largely of photons, self-reproducing spectra in a lasing cavity fed by a gain medium? What of geomorphology? I do not know. Perhaps it suYces at this stage to have begun an enquiry, an investigation, rather than to have completed it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Games</ENAMEX>
I turn, in the final section of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, to yet another puzzle concerning what I call a natural game. A natural game is a way of making a living in an environment. That is, autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are able to act on their own behalf and regularly do so in order to make a living in an environment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> swimming upstream in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose gradient</ENAMEX> is making a living in its environment. So, in fact, are all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living entities in the biosphere.
Well, it seems straightforward enough; we all know more or less what it is to make a living. For example, I am currently writing Investigations as part of my own hopefully not-too-solipsistic eVorts to make my own living as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>.
But natural games are not quite so straightforward. I begin by mentioning again the rather surprising no-free-lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorem</ENAMEX> proved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Macready</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wolpert</ENAMEX> as postdoctoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>. Recall that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> were wondering whether there might be some search algorithm for adapting on a fitness landscape that was inherently better than all other algorithms. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Holland</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>, is justly well-known for inventing his â€œgenetic algorithmâ€ to optimize hard computational problems. The genetic algorithm, which has been rather widely used in academic and industrial settings, is based on analogy with biological adaptation driven by mutation, recombination, and selection.
In eVect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> were wondering whether biological systems in this biosphere happen to have stumbled on the best possible optimization procedure. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the answer appears to be no. Macready and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolpert</ENAMEX> considered a mathematically well-formulated set of â€œall possible fitness landscapesâ€ and showed that, averaged over all landscapes, no search algorithm outperforms any other algorithm. No free lunch.
In short, given an arbitrary fitness landscape, only some search algorithms do well on that landscape. The search procedure must be tuned to the fitness landscapes being searched if the search procedure is to be more eVective than average among search procedures.
But this poses the important problem raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 1</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are sexual, hence adapt using both mutation and recombination as part of their search procedures in making natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">livings</ENAMEX>. But my own and other research demonstrates that recombination is essentially useless on very rugged fitness landscapes. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Feldman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aviv Bergman</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> have shown that if genes that evolve on rugged landscapes increase the frequency of recombination in model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, they will not be selected to increase, hence establish, recombination. Yet most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are sexual and pay the twofold loss in fitness in requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. If so, presumably our biosphere is rife with the kinds of smooth correlated landscapes for which recombination is a good search procedure.
Then how is it that in our biosphere we should find a family of landscapes that happen to be well searched by recombination? Either such smooth landscapes are built into the physical nature of things or evolution has itself somehow brought forth the very kinds of landscapes that are well searched by mutation and recombination. Restated, assuming that mutation and recombination are, in fact, good search procedures for the kinds of fitness landscapes inhabited by we mere mortals as we were hanging around and adaptively hill climbing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four billion years</TIMEX>, I ask again: Whence these wonderful fitness landscapes that are so well suited to be climbed by mutation and recombination?
Letâ€™s try another tack. Assume for the sake of discussion that I am right about my formulation of molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lifeÂ =Â and</ENAMEX> I argue, autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">agentsÂ =Â began</ENAMEX>, their diversity was low. There are now some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, representing perhaps a thousandth of the total diversity that has wandered our globe. The rest have gone extinct. Natural games, ways of making a living, have obviously coevolved with the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, making those livings. So, as I imagined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> telling us in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 1, â</ENAMEX>€œThe winning natural games are the games the winning species play.â€
Well, of course, the winning natural games are the games the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> play. But what natural games are these? The reasonable answer leaps to mind. The winning games must be those that are readily searched out by the very adaptive search procedures used by the coevolving autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> themselves.
In short, a biosphere is a self-consistent coevolutionary construction of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and ways of making a living that are themselves self-consistently well searched by the search procedures the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are using. In colloquial terms, from our experience in economic systems, jobs come into existence with jobholders. If no one can learn or exploit a given kind of job, that sort of job will not be widely populated and will not become diVerentiated into a family of similar jobs.
In the biosphere, modes of making a living that are well-searched by mutation and recombination will be populated by many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sibling species</ENAMEX> making their livings by playing slightly diVerent natural games. Those natural games, therefore, proliferate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways</ENAMEX> of making a living that cannot be explored successfully by mutation and recombination will not aVord new niches for many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sibling species</ENAMEX>, so those natural games will not proliferate.
We are literally making our world together, we critters. If we couldnâ€™t make livings at it given our search procedures of mutation, recombination, and selection, we wouldnâ€™t be making our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">livings</ENAMEX> doing what we are doing. These comments are only the start of understanding, and I do not profess to hold much of that understanding. But I can begin to point. A biosphere is a self-consistent coevolutionary construction of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> making livings, the natural games that constitute those livings, and the search mechanisms that allow such modes of living to be persistently mastered by adaptive natural selection.
Most broadly, I believe a general biology awaits founding. And I believe that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> will prove central to that eVort. The next feature of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that I will note in closing this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> will be central to any general biology. Precisely because an autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> links exergonic and endergonic reactions in work cycles, the breakdown of high-energy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> here can be used to build up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> there. Indeed, the coevolution of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> naturally leads to a linked web of exergonic and endergonic reactions within and between the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Breakdown of this stuV here is linked to the excess build up of that stuV there. By these linkages, sunlight spattered carelessly on this swirl of stuV <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million</NUMEX> miles from our average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> cumulates into the wondrous structure of the giant redwoods, tall on the western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. Precisely because autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> carry out work cycles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">theyÂ =Â weÂ =Â literally</ENAMEX> build a biosphere.
And the central factors underlying that buildup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> are the same factors that apply in an economyÂ =Â that merely human extension of biospheres. The central factors, in fact, center on â€œadvantages of trade.â€ We can see this keystone concept by supposing that you and I are the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a tiny economy. You begin life with an endowment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>. I begin life with an endowment of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>. Suppose your happiness, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œutility,â€ would increase if you had fewer rather than more <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> and more rather than fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, you have more <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>. I, in turn, happen to have desires such that I would be happier with rather more <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, I have more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>.
You and I have advantages of trade. We can both be happier if we swap some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> for some of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>. It is essential to understand that, indeed, both of us can be better oV by trading. Advantages of trade are the fundamental factor driving trade itself in an economy. In an actual simple economic model, advantages of trade are studied in an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œEdgeworth box</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">â€ Edgeworth</ENAMEX> invented a two-dimensional box representation of values, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">â</NUMEX>€œworths,â€ plotted along the edge of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX>). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edgeworth</ENAMEX> box, I am represented at the bottom-left corner, you are represented at the top-right corner. A family of equal happiness, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œisoutilityâ€ curves</ENAMEX>, show your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">â€œisohappinessâ</ENAMEX>€ trade-oVs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> at any total abundance to you of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>. You are, in general, happier the more total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> you have. Your happiness landscape increases from low to high like a cone-shaped mountain whose peak is located over my head. On that peak, you have all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> in the system.
My isohappiness trade-oV curves begin low at the lower-left corner and mount to a peak over your head in the upper-right corner, when I would have all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>.
The curvature of my isohappiness curves and your isohappiness curves are bent such that they are convex from my and your points of view. Therefore, if the initial economy starts with you having most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> and I most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>, as shown as a point toward the lower-right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Edgeworth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.6</NUMEX>, then that initial point of the economy lies on the intersection of a specific isohappiness curve for you and an isohappiness curve for me.
And now we can see advantages of trade. Any point that lies inside the region bounded by our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isohappiness curves is, therefore, higher on your happiness landscape and also higher on my happiness landscape. Thus, anywhere inside the region bounded by our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isohappiness curves, we are both happier. We have advantages of trade within this area bounded by our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isohappiness curves.
A few more points from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economics</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>. Consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of your isohappiness curves and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of my isohappiness curves. Pick one of your isohappiness curves. There will be exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my isohappiness curves that just touches your isohappiness curve at a single position, thus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point of tangency. Therefore, for each of your isohappiness curves, there is a unique point of tangency with one of my isohappiness curves. Therefore we can draw a line connecting those points of tangency. In particular, we can draw a line of those tangencies across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isohappiness curves, yours and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>, that meet at the initial apple-pear distributions to you and me at the outset, before trading, and define the region where we have advantages of trade.
The line of tangency is called the â€œcontract curve.â€ Along the contract curve, there is no way to exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> that increases both our happiness. If you are happier, I am less happy. The contract curve is said to be â€œPareto-eYcient.â€ There is no way to make you happier without making me less happy, and vice versa. In contrast, if we have not yet attained the contract curve, there are further advantages of trade that we can attain. The economic concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">â€œpriceâ€</ENAMEX> in this context is just the ratio of exchange between you and me, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evidently</ENAMEX>, if we attain one of the points on the contract curve, that corresponds to some exchange ratio and is the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>.
Now, nothing in a one-shot exchange economy picks any particular point on the contract curve. We tussle along the contract curve, each trying to get all the advantages of the trade. But what if we could take our happiness, now call it utility or wealth, and reinvest it in making orchards that grew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX>? In an economy with reinvestment, what happens if we can take our advantages of trade and reinvest any excess so that we can create more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pears</ENAMEX> than we had to start with?
Then let me draw an analogy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bacterial species</ENAMEX> or other autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Let happiness, or the economistâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>, become â€œrate of reproduction,â€ hence, fitness. Let increased happiness become â€œincreased rate of reproduction,â€ hence, increased fitness. Let the advantages of trade map into mutualistic interactions in which you and I, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, help one another reproduce more rapidly. Case in point: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legume</ENAMEX> root systems with microrhizzae and symbiotic fungi, in which the root and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> capture sunlight and water and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> and supply sugars to the fungi, while the fungi capture nitrogen from the air and fix it into amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and supply amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Plant</ENAMEX> and fungi feed one another.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> mutualists, A and B, can have advantages of trade. Molecules created at metabolic cost in A and secreted can help B reproduce faster. Molecules created at metabolic cost in B and secreted can help A reproduce faster. If the help is larger than the metabolic cost in both directions, both win by helping the other. Indeed, you can quickly intuit that, since both A and B will reproduce exponentially, there might be a fixed ratio of the abundance of A and abundance of B species such that each helps the other optimally. If so, then the enhancement in the growth of A and B by their mutual interaction must be the same, otherwise, either A or B would soon be exponentially more abundant than the other, and the mutual help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> would fall apart.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Schuster</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Stadler</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> and I at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> created a simple model of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">replicating RNA species</ENAMEX>, A and B, that did help one another in just these ways, and it confirmed that in the appropriate mutual help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the A + B mixed community outgrew A alone or B alone. Further, the growth was such that the ratio of A and B remained fixed. Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aâ€™s</ENAMEX> product molecules and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bâ€™s</ENAMEX> product molecules also remained fixed at a specific point on the contract curve. That point corresponds to price. So in at least some simple models, when autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> form a mutualism, A and B helping one another, they have found a means to create advantages of trade, and they can find and remain on a fixed point on the contract curve that establishes an exchange ratioÂ =Â the price.
And note with the plant root and the fungi, thermodynamic work has been done by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> to synthesize the sugars from sunlight, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX>, and thermodynamic work has been done by the fungi to fix nitrogen from the air into amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a real biosphere</TIMEX>, the linking of exergonic to endergonic reactions by which thermodynamic work is done to build up complex organization is, in fact, inextricably linked with the emergence of new advantages of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tradeÂ =Â new</ENAMEX>, enhanced ways to make livings in new niches. In the present case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> helps both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and fungi reproduce more rapidly.
So, as noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the fact that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> do link exergonic and endergonic reactions is central to the creation of advantages of trade and hence, new niches, new mutualistic opportunities. They lead to the vast web of an ecosystem trapping sunlight; gobbling some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, nitrogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX>, and a few other simple molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>; and literally building up the vast profusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwinâ</ENAMEX>€™s tangled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>. Ultimately, we should be able to build a theory that accounts for the distribution of advantages of trade, the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> times of energy stored in diVerent forms in an ecosystem, as well as the statistical patterns of linking of exergonic and endergonic reactions in a biosphere as it builds itself and persistently explores novel ways of making a living, the novel niches that permit the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwinâ</ENAMEX>€™s minor variations creating novel species for those niches.
The curious thing about evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it? Not me. Not yet. Yet I hope there may be general principles governing the self-consistent construction of any biosphere. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> chapters I will hazard a hunch or two about such general laws, but we are only at the beginning of a general biology.
