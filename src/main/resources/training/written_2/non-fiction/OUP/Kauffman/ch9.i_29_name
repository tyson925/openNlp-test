The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Persistently Innovative Econosphere</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> is no accident that the words for economics and ecology have the same <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> root, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhouse</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Ecology</ENAMEX> and economics are, at root, the same. The economy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo habilis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo erectus</ENAMEX>, the stunning flaked flint tools of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Magdalinian</ENAMEX> culture of the magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cro-Magnon</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> when the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> had retreated southward from the glaciation, the invention and spread of writing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> agora, and today‚Äôs global economy are all in the deepest sense merely the carrying on of the more diversified forms of trade that had their origins with the first autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four billion years ago</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economics</ENAMEX> has its roots in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> and the emergence of advantages of trade among autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. The advantages of trade predate the human economy by essentially the entire history of life on this planet. Advantages of trade are found in the metabolic exchange of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">legume root nodule</ENAMEX> and fungi, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> for fixed nitrogen carried in amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Advantages of trade were found among the mixed microbial and algal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> along the littoral of the earth‚Äôs oceans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four billion years ago</TIMEX>. The trading of the econosphere is an outgrowth of the trading of the biosphere.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economics</ENAMEX> has considered itself the science of allocation of scarce resources. In doing so, it shortchanges its proper domain. Indeed, if we stand back and squint, it is easy to see the most awesome feature of an economy and its roots in autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>: The most awesome feature of the econosphere, as of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">biosphere¬†¬†both</ENAMEX> built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in their urgent plunging, lunging, sliding, gliding, hiding, trading, and providing¬†¬†has been a blossoming diversity of molecular and organismic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and of novel ways of making a living that has persistently burgeoned into the adjacent possible. From <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of</NUMEX> organic molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of trillions</NUMEX>; from one or a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to a standing diversity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some hundred million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and a total diversity some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> to thousandfold larger of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> come and gone.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo erectus</ENAMEX> had fire and early tools. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo habilis</ENAMEX> traded stone axe parts . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>. The diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cro-Magnon</ENAMEX> goods and services in the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some , years ago</TIMEX> may have numbered in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundreds</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few thousands</NUMEX>. Today, surf the web and count the diversity of goods and services, the ways of making a living; it is in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>.
Neither the biosphere nor the econosphere are merely about the distribution of limited resources, both are expressions of the immense creativity of the universe, and in particular, of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> as we exapt molecularly, morphologically, and technologically in untold, unforetellable ways persistently into the adjacent possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> and job <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> jointly coevolve into existence in the econosphere in an ever-expanding web of diverse complexity.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most striking facts about current economic theory is that it has no account of this persistent secular explosion of diversity of goods, services, and ways of making a living. Strange, is it not, that we have no theory of these overwhelming facts of the biosphere and econosphere? Strange, is it not, that we pay no attention to one of the most profound features of the world right smack in front of our collective nose? And consistent with this strangeness, the most comprehensive theory, the rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of modern economics, the beautiful ‚Äúcompetitive general equilibrium‚Äù theory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debreu</ENAMEX>, does not and cannot discuss this explosion, perhaps the most important feature of the economy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Competitive Equilibrium</ENAMEX> and Its Limitations
So we begin with an outline of competitive general equilibrium as the cornerstone conceptual framework of modern economics. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Arrow</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. As one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventors</ENAMEX> of the framework, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX> is more at liberty to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critic</ENAMEX> than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> who have followed in his footsteps. My best reading of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ken‚</ENAMEX>Äôs view, which I share, is that competitive general equilibrium is, at present, the only overarching framework we have to think about the economy as a whole. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX> suspects that that framework is incomplete; I agree.
Competitive general equilibrium grows out of a conceptual framework in which the core question is how prices form such that markets clear. Recall the famous supply-and-demand curves for a single good (Figure .). As a function of increasing price, plotted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis, supply, plotted on the y-axis, increases from low to high. More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are willing to create widgets as the price per widget increases. On the other hand, demand, where demand is also plotted on the y-axis, decreases from high to low as prices increase. Fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are willing to buy widgets as the price per widget increases.
As the figure shows, the supply-and-demand curves cross at some price. At that price, the markets ‚Äúclear,‚Äù that is, all the widgets supplied are purchased. The price at which markets clear is the ‚Äúequilibrium price.‚Äù
For a single good, the problem is simple. But consider <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>. Since many of us like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> on our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, the demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> depends not only on the price and hence the supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>, but also on the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, hence on the supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>. And vice versa, the demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> depends upon the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> and hence on the supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of goods, where the demand for any one good depends upon the price of many goods and the supply of any one good depends upon the price of many goods, it is not so obvious that there is a price for each good such that all markets clear.
But worse, the supply or demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> may be dierent than the supply or demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>. And still worse, the supply or demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> may depend on all sorts of odd contingent facts. For example, if severe cold kills the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>, the supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> will drop; if a bumper <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> comes available globally because of weather or suddenly improved irrigation and farming practices worldwide, the supply will go up.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debreu</ENAMEX> made brilliant steps. First, they consider a space of all possible dated and contingent goods. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of their examples of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdated contingent good‚</ENAMEX>Äù is ‚Äú ton of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> delivered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May ,</TIMEX> , under the condition that the average <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six preceding months</TIMEX> has been <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> less than normal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past fifty years</TIMEX> and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Red Sox</ENAMEX> won the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX>.‚Äù
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX>-Debreu theory, we are to imagine an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auctioneer</ENAMEX>, who at a defined beginning of time, say, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>, holds an auction covering all possible dated contingent goods. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suppliers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> gather at this imaginary auction, bidding ensues for all possible dated contingent goods, with values calculated under dierent hypotheses about the probabilities that the dierent dated contingencies will come about. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of an imaginary hour</TIMEX> of frantic bargaining, the auction closes. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> now have contracts to buy or sell all possible dated contingent goods, each at a fixed price. Everybody hustles home to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Morning America</ENAMEX>. And, wondrously, however the future unfolds, whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">there‚Äôs rain</ENAMEX>, sun, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX>, the dated contingent contracts that are appropriate come due, the contracts are fulfilled at the preestablished price for each contract, and all markets clear.
It is mind-boggling that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Debreu</ENAMEX> proved these results. The core means of the solution depends upon what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematicians</ENAMEX> call ‚Äúfixed-point theorems.‚Äù A beginning case is your hair, particularly for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, where short hair makes the fixed point easy to see. When you comb your hair in a normal fashion, there is a point roughly on top of your head, slightly to the back, where a roughly circular swirl of hair occurs (ignoring baldness) around a fixed point where typically a bit of scalp shows through.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">general theorem</ENAMEX> considers hair on a spherical surface and combing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> in any way you want. You cannot avoid a fixed point. More generally, replace hair by arrows, with tails and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>, where each arrow is a line with an arrow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end, drawn on the surface of the sphere. The arrows may bend if you like. Each arrow can be thought of as mapping the point on the sphere at the tail of that arrow to the point of the sphere at the tip of that arrow. So the arrows are a mapping of the surface of the sphere onto itself. For a continuous mapping, such that there is a mapping from each point on the sphere, a general fixed-point theorem proves that there must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> point on the surface of the sphere that maps onto itself¬†¬†that point is a fixed point under the arrow mapping.
The wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow-Debreu</ENAMEX> general competitive equilibrium theorems depend on such a fixed point. In a space where all possible dated contingent goods can be prestated and all possible markets for trade of all such goods exist, a fixed point also exists that corresponds to a price at which all such markets clear, however the future unfolds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Debreu</ENAMEX> won the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> for their work, and won it deservedly. It is a beautiful theory. Yet there are important critiques of general competitive equilibrium. For example, the theorem depends on ‚Äúcomplete markets,‚Äù that is, markets to trade all possible dated contingent goods, and fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists</ENAMEX> have raised issues about how well the theory works if markets are incomplete, as indeed they are.
I pose, however, a wider set of issues. The overarching feature of the economy over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past million years or so</TIMEX> is the secular increase in the diversity of goods and services, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen million</NUMEX> or more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Nowhere does general competitive equilibrium speak about this. Nor can the theory speak about the growth in diversity of goods and services, for it assumes at the outset that one can finitely prestate all possible dated contingent goods. Then the theory uses complete markets and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a fixed</NUMEX>-point theorem to prove that a price exists such that markets clear.
But we have seen grounds to be deeply suspicious of the claim that we can finitely prestate all possible exaptations¬†¬†whether they be new organic functionalities or new goods¬†¬†that arise in a biosphere or an econosphere, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gertrude</ENAMEX> learning to fly in her terrified leap from the pine tree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">million years ago last Friday</TIMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> suddenly realizing that the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> itself could serve as the chassis.
I do not believe for a moment that we can finitely prestate all possible goods and services. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economists intuitively</ENAMEX> know this. They distinguish between normal uncertainty and ‚ÄúKnightian uncertainty.‚Äù Normal uncertainty is the kind we are familiar with in probability theory concerning flipping coins. I am unsure whether in flips there will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> and tails. Thanks to lots of work, I can now calculate the probability of any outcome in the finitely prestated space of possible outcomes.
Knightian uncertainty concerns those cases where we do not yet know the possible outcomes. Knightian uncertainty has rested in an epistemologically uncomfortable place in economics and elsewhere. Why? Because we have not realized that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere or an econo-sphere; by contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laplace, Boltzmann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einstein</ENAMEX>, and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bohr</ENAMEX> have all more or less presupposed that we can finitely prestate the configuration space of any domain open to scientific enquiry. After all, as I have noted, we can and do prestate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> configuration space for a liter of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> gas particles.
From this point of view, the wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX>-Debreu theory is fundamentally flawed.
Moreover, general competitive equilibrium, seen as a culmination of one central strand of economic theory, is too limited. Insofar as economics is concerned with understanding the establishment of prices at which markets clear, general competitive equilibrium was a masterpiece. But insofar as economics is or should be concerned with how and why economies increase the diversity of goods and services, the reigning theory is a nonstarter. And since the growth in wealth per capita over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past million years</TIMEX> is deeply related to the growth in the diversity of technology and goods and services, contemporary economics is clearly inadequate.
We need a theory of the persistent coming into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services, rather like the persistent emergence of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in an ecosystem and extinction of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. In the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, we discussed ecosystems as self-organized critical. We discussed the bio-sphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in self-organized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events. We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record. And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and genera.
But the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events. Consider my favorite example: The introduction of the automobile drove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, as a mode of transport, extinct. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> went the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX>, the buggy, the stable, the smithy, the saddlery, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pony Express</ENAMEX>. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> came paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, an oil and gas industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX>, fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and suburbia. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Schumpeter</ENAMEX>, called these gales of creative destruction, where old goods die and new ones are born. One bets that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schumpeterian</ENAMEX> gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution, with many small avalanches and few large ones. More, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes, what of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Firms</ENAMEX> do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> die young, some last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>. We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributions.
The parallels are at least tantalizing, and probably more than that. While the mechanisms of heritable variation dier and the selection criteria dier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in the biosphere and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the econosphere are busy trying to make a living and explore new ways of making a living. In both cases, the puzzling conditions for the evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cocreation</ENAMEX> and coassembly of increasing diversity are present. The biosphere and econosphere are persistently transforming, persistently inventing, persistently dying, persistently getting on with it, and, on average, persistently diversifying. And into a framework of such a diversifying set of goods and services we must graft the central insights of general competitive equilibrium as the approximate short-timescale mechanism that achieves a rough-and-ready approximate clearing of markets at each stage of the evolution of the economy.
A rough hypothetical biological example may help understand market clearing in a more relaxed formal framework than general competitive equilibrium. Consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bacterial species</ENAMEX>, red and blue. Suppose the red species secretes a red metabolite, at metabolic cost to itself, that aids the replication rate of the blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Conversely, suppose the blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> secretes a dierent blue metabolite, at metabolic cost to itself, that increases the replication rate of the red species. Then the conditions for a mutualism are possible. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX> stated, if blue helps red more than it costs itself, and vice versa, a mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of blue and red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> may grow. How will it happen? And is there an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">optimal ‚Äúexchange rate‚Äù</ENAMEX> of blue-secreted metabolite to red-secreted metabolite, where that exchange rate is the analogue of price?
Well, it can and does happen. Here is the gedankenexperiment: Imagine an ordered set of blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mutant bacteria</ENAMEX> that secrete dierent amounts of the blue metabolite that helps the red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Say the range of secretion is from to molecules per minute per blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, with metabolic cost to the blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> proportional to the number of molecules secreted. Conversely, imagine mutant red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that secrete from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">to</NUMEX> of the red molecules valuable to the blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, at a similar cost proportional to the number of molecules secreted.
Now create a large, square petri plate with rows and columns drawn on the plastic below to guide your experimental hands. Arrange the rows, numbered to to correspond to blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> secreting to molecules a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. Arrange the columns, numbered to to correspond to the red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> secreting to molecules a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. Into each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">x cells</ENAMEX> on your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> petri plate, place exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> red and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> with the corresponding secretion rates. Thus, in the upper left, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that are low blue and low red secretors are coplated onto each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. On the lower left, high blue and low red secretors are coplated. On the upper right, low blue and high red secretors are coplated. And in the lower right corner, high red and high blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are coplated.
Go for lunch, and dinner, and come back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>. In general, among the , coplated pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, while all , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> will have grown, a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> will have grown to the largest mixed red-blue bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. Say the largest mixed red-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> corresponds to red secreting molecules per second, blue secreting molecules per second.
This gedankenexperiment is important, for the exchange ratio of red and blue molecules is the analogue of price, the ratio of trading of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX>. And there exists a ratio, red molecules to blue molecules per second, that maximizes the growth of the mixed red-blue bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>. Since the fastest growing mixed red-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> will exponentially outgrow all others and dominate our gedankenexperiment petri plate, this red-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pair establishes ‚Äúprice‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the system at red to blue molecules. Further, in the fastest growing red-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>, where red secretes molecules and blue secretes molecules per second, both the red and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in that mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> are replicating at the identical optimum rate. As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> , using a rough mapping of biology to economics, that rate of replication of a bacterium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corresponds</ENAMEX> to economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> and the increased the rate of replication corresponds to increased economic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX>. The red and blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> not only establish price, but they also share equally the advantages of trade present along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pareto-ecient</ENAMEX> contract curve in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edgeworth</ENAMEX> box discussed in chapter .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutualists</ENAMEX> in the biosphere have been hacking out rough price equilibria for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and have done so without foresight and without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX>-Debreu fixed-point theorems. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critters</ENAMEX> have been hacking out rough price equilibria even as exaptations and new ways of living have come into existence and old ways have perished. Presumably, these rough biological price equilibria are reached because in the short and intermediate term they optimize the fitness of both of the mutualists. And the markets clear, in the sense that all the red molecules are exchanged for blue molecules per second. But it‚Äôs a self-organized critical world out there, with small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction events in the biosphere and econosphere, and equilibrium price or no, most species and technologies, job <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> and jobs, are no longer among us to mumble about advantages of trade.
I confess I am happier with this image of prices established in local, rough-and-ready ways at many points in an ecosystem or economy than with the beautiful fixed-point theorems of general competitive equilibrium. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">horseshoe crabs</ENAMEX> keep establishing rough price equilibria in their mutualisms without a prespecified space of ways of making a living. If they can do it, so can we mere <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Getting on with it in the absence of predefined configuration spaces has been the persistent provenance of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> since we stumbled into existence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rational Expectations</ENAMEX> and Its Limitations
Actually, there has been a major extension of general competitive equilibrium called ‚Äúrational expectations.‚Äù Like general competitive equilibrium, this theory too is beautiful but, I think, deeply flawed.
Rational expectations grew, in part, out of an attempt to understand actual trading on stock exchanges. Under general competitive equilibrium, little trading should occur and stock prices should hover in the vicinity of their fundamental value, typically understood as the discounted present value of the future revenue stream from the stock. But, in fact, abundant trading does occur, and speculative bubbles and crashes occur. Rational expectations theory is built up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around another fixed</NUMEX>-point theorem. Rational expectations theory assumes a set of economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> with beliefs about how the economy is working. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> base their economic actions on those beliefs. A fixed point can exist under which the actions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, given their beliefs about the economy, exactly create the expected economic behavior. So, under rational expectations one can understand bubbles. It is rational to believe that prices are going above fundamental value and thus to invest, and the investments sustain the bubble for a period of time.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Homo economicus</ENAMEX> has been thought to be infinitely rational. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX>-Debreu setting, such infinitely rational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> bargain and achieve the best equilibrium price for each dated contingent good. In rational expectations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> figure out how the economy is working and behave in such a way that the expected economic system is the one that arises. The theories and actions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> self-consistently create an economy fitting the theories under which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> operate.
But beautiful as these fixed-point theorems are, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> troubles in the rational expectations framework. First, the beautiful fixed points may not be stable to minor fluctuations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent behaviors</ENAMEX>. Under fluctuations, the economic system may progressively veer away from the fixed point into a feared conceptual no-man‚Äôs-land. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, achieving the fixed points seems to demand excessive rationality to fit real human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. So it appears necessary to extend rational expectations.
One direction was broached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herb Simon</ENAMEX> introduced the terms <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúsatisficing,‚Äù and ‚Äúbounded rationality</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Both seem sensible but have been problematic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satisficing</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> do not optimize but do well enough; yet it has been hard to make this concept pay o. It has also been hard to make advances with the concept of bounded rationality for the simple reason that there is one way, typically, of being infinitely smart and indefinitely many ways of being rather stupid. What determines the patterns of bounded stupidity? How should economic theory proceed?
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Natural Rationality Is Bounded</ENAMEX>
I suspect that there may be a natural extension to rational expectations applicable to human and any strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, and I report a body of work suggested by me but largely carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince Darley</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> for his doctoral thesis. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> virtues of our eorts are to find a natural bound to infinite rationality and a natural sense of satisficing.
The core ideas stated for human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are these: Suppose you have a sequence of events, say, the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>, and want to predict next month‚Äôs price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX>. Suppose you have data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty months</TIMEX>. Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fourier</ENAMEX> invented his famous decomposition, which states that any wiggly line on a blackboard can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by a weighted sum of sine and cosine waves of dierent wavelengths and phase osets, chosen out of the infinite number of possible sine and cosine functions with all possible wavelengths.
Now, you could try to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfit‚Äù the data on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> prices with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Fourier ‚Äúmode</ENAMEX>,‚Äù namely the average price. But presumably if the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> prices vary a fair amount, that average will not predict the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-first month‚</TIMEX>Äôs price very well. You have ‚Äúunderfit the data.‚Äù Or you could use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> or more Fourier modes, all dierent wavelengths, with dierent phase osets, and you would, roughly, wind up drawing a straight line between the adjacent pairs of points in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-period</TIMEX> series. This procedure will not help too much in predicting the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-first period</TIMEX>. You have ‚Äúoverfit‚Äù the data by using too many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fourier</ENAMEX> modes.
Typically, optimal prediction of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-first period</TIMEX> price will be achieved by using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fourier</ENAMEX> modes, each of dierent wavelength and dierent phase oset. As is well known in the art, you have neither underfit nor overfit your data.
This fact suggests that the optimal prediction of a short sequence of data is obtained by a model of intermediate complexity¬†¬†a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fourier modes</ENAMEX>, neither a single one nor very many. The sense of bounded rationality <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince</ENAMEX> and I want to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> is that optimal prediction of a limited time series is achieved with models using only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fourier modes</ENAMEX>, or their analogs in other basis sets¬†¬†models of modest, or bounded, complexity.
The rest of the theory <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince</ENAMEX> and I have developed goes to show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> who have theories of one another and act selfishly based on those theories will typically create a persistently changing pattern of actions. Therefore, they persistently create a nonstationary world in which only the relatively recent past has valid data. Thus, there is always only a limited amount of valid data on which to base theories, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, in turn, must always build models of intermediate, bounded complexity to avoid over- or underfitting the meager valid data.
Natural rationality is, in this sense, bounded. It is bounded because we mutually create nonstationary worlds. What happens is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> act under their theories. But in due course some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> acts in a way that falsifies the theories of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> either are stubborn or change their theories. If they change their theories of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, then typically they also change their actions. In turn, those changes disconfirm the theory of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, and perhaps still other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> wind up in a space of coevolving theories and actions with no fixed-point, stable steady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, which means that past actions are a poor guide to future actions by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> since his theories, and hence his action plans, have changed. But this means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> mutually create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúnonstationary‚Äù</ENAMEX> time series of actions (nonstationary just means that the statistical characteristics of the time series keep changing because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> keep changing their theories and actions). In turn, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> typically have only a modest amount of relatively recent data that is still valid and reliable on which to base their next theories of one another. Given only a modest amount of valid and reliable data, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> must avoid overfitting or underfitting that smallish amount of data, so they must use theories of intermediate complexity¬†¬†for example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fourier</ENAMEX> modes to fit the data, not one or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince</ENAMEX> and I want to say that natural rationality is bounded to models of intermediate complexity because we collectively and persistently create nonstationary worlds together. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>-based computer models <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince</ENAMEX> has created for his thesis, just this behavior is seen. Indeed, we allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to evolve how much of the past history of the interactions they will pay attention to and how complex their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of one another will be¬†¬†one, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, or fifty Fourier modes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agents</ENAMEX> evolve in a history and complexity space to find currently optimal amounts of history and complexity to use to optimally predict their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. In our little world, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> evolve to use a modest history, ignoring the distant past, and only modestly complex theories of one another.
We have found evidence of a further, perhaps generic, property that appears to drive such systems to settle down, then change in a sudden burst. As the system of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and actions settles down to some repeatable behavior, an increasingly wide range of alternative theories, simple and very complex, fit the same data. But the complex theories, with many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fourier</ENAMEX> modes, attempt to predict fine details of the repeatable behavior. As those theories become more complex, they are more fragile because they can be disconfirmed by ever more minor fluctuations in the repeatable behavior. Sooner or later such a fluctuation happens, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> disconfirmed theories change theories and actions radically, setting up a vast avalanche of changes of theories and actions that sweeps the system, driving the collective behavior far from any repeatable pattern. In these new circumstances, only a small subset of theories fits the current facts, so the diversity, and complexity, of theories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agents plummets</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> finds its way back to some repeatable pattern of behavior.
In short, there appears to be not only a bounded complexity in our rationality, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fragility¬†-¬†stability cyclic</ENAMEX> oscillation in our joint theories and actions as well. In these terms, the system of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and theories never settles down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a fixed</NUMEX>-point equilibrium in which markets clear. Instead, the system repeatedly fluctuates away from the contract curve then returns to new points in the vicinity of the contract curve. Hence, in precisely the sense of repeatedly fluctuating away from a contract curve then returning to its vicinity, the system does not achieve an optimizing price equilibrium, but satisfices.
The bounded complexity issues would seem to apply to any coevolving autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that are able to make theories of one another and base actions on those theories. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> chasing the gazelle and the starfish predating the trilobite are, we suppose, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popperian</ENAMEX> creatures able to formulate hypotheses about their worlds that may sometimes die in their stead. Presumably all such autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, under persistent mutation and selection, would opt for changeable models of one another of bounded complexity.
While these steps are only a beginning to go beyond rational expectations in economics, they seem promising. Whatever natural, or unnatural, games autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are playing as they and we coevolve in a biosphere or econo-sphere, nonstationarity arises on many levels. Here we see it at the level of the agents‚Äô theories of one another and the actions based on those theories. Perhaps this is just part of how the world works. Given the semantic import of yuck and yum, and the reality of natural games for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox</ENAMEX> and hare, for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and paramecium, these changing theories and actions are part of the fabric of history of the market, the savannah, and the small pond.
Natural rationality is bounded by the very nonstationarity of the worlds we cocreate as we coexapt.
Technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graphs and Economic Webs</ENAMEX>
Life takes its unexpected turns. I have been an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academic scientist</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, then twelve stunningly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exciting years</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I‚</ENAMEX>Äôve written the canonical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> or more scientific articles, was fortunate enough to receive a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacArthur Fellowship</ENAMEX>, during whose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> my IQ went up and then slumped back to normal as the funding ended, invented and patented this and that, and published <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previous books of which I am proud, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe</ENAMEX>, both by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University Press</ENAMEX>.
I thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Origins</ENAMEX> and At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home</ENAMEX> were largely about the challenge of extending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darwinism</ENAMEX> to an account of evolution that embraced both self-organization and natural selection in some new, still poorly understood marriage. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX>, after all, we still have only inklings about the kinds of systems that are capable of adaptation. What principles, if any, govern the coevolutionary assembly of complex systems such as ecosystems or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> common law, where a new finding by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> alters precedent in ways that ricochet in small and large avalanches through the law? If new determinations by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> did not have any wider impact, the law could not evolve. If every new determination altered interpretation of precedents throughout the entire corpus of common law, the law also could not evolve.
My rough bet is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> capable of coevolutionary construction, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> common law, can evolve and accumulate complexity because they are somehow self-organized critical, and a power law distribution of avalanches of implications of new precedent ricochet in the law and in other complex coevolving systems to allow complexity to accumulate. Indeed, based on self-organized criticality, and more particularly on the analysis of the NK fitness landscape model discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins and At Home and the ‚Äúpatches‚Äù</ENAMEX> version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> model discussed in At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home</ENAMEX>, I am rather persuaded that adapting systems can best exploit the trade-o between exploitation and exploration at a rough phase transition between order and chaos. Here power law distributions of small and large avalanches of change can and do propagate through the system as it adapts.
So saying, and having published <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Origins</ENAMEX> and then At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home</ENAMEX>, I was rather surprised to find business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> approaching me. The consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McKinsey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lybrand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> began visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX> to learn about the ‚Äúnew sciences of complexity.‚Äù In due course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Meyer</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> for Business Innovation at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> asked me if I might be interested in forming a fifty-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty</NUMEX> partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> to discover if complexity science, that nuanced term, could be applied in the practical world. I found myself deeply intrigued. Was the work of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> and myself mere theory or did it have application in real biospheres and econospheres? Why not plunge in and try my best to find out, to do it right, even knowing how early was the stage of the science we had been inventing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bios Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, the partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>, is now just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-and-a-half years old</TIMEX>. We have grown to over seventy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, heading, we hope, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX>. Our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> revenues are running at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ million</NUMEX>. We have a hopeful eye on <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ to $ million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX>, for whom we invented a novel adaptive chip, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> with its concern for adaptive combat, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASDAQ</ENAMEX> stock market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Airlines</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Sta</ENAMEX>, and others. We have spun out a biotechnology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIStem Molecular</ENAMEX>, that aims to clone the small cis acting DNA regions that control turning genes on and o in development and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro-Bios</ENAMEX>; as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EXA</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> spun out with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASDAQ</ENAMEX> to make tools for financial markets. I‚Äôm deeply glad to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bios</ENAMEX>, to be working with a very creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, and to be finding routes in the practical world where our ideas do, in fact, apply.
I mention <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bios</ENAMEX> and my involvement because some of the science we have done bears on diverse aspects of practical economics and even begins to suggest pathways beyond the limitations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX>-Debreu theory. I begin with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>, which came to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bios</ENAMEX> wondering how to design and build <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX>. Out of what modular parts and processes, wonder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>, might it be possible to assemble a family of related <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> for a diversity of markets?
The obvious approach was to invent <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúLego World</ENAMEX>.‚Äù As founding general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> and chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>, I duly authorized the expenditure of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$</NUMEX>. to buy a largish box of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> parts. (In truth, I fib. I actually won the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> box at our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bios Christmas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.)
Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of this book will be familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX>. It is a construction game consisting of snap-together, plastic parts, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square blocks</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> in size, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x , x , x , and x</ENAMEX> blocks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> can be assembled into wonderfully <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex structures</ENAMEX>, as many delighted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> have discovered.
But what might <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> World be? What, indeed. Well, consider a large pile of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> blocks on a bare wooden table. Consider these blocks the ‚Äúprimitive parts.‚Äù Now consider all the primitive construction or deconstruction operations, pressing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts together or adding a primitive part to a growing assemblage, or taking a part o another part or o an assemblage.
Consider the pile of unassembled bare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> parts as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set, and place in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúrank ‚</ENAMEX>Äù all the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects that can be constructed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set in a single construction step. Thus, a x can be attached in a specific overlapping way to a x . Now place in rank all the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects that can be constructed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set in two construction (or deconstruction) steps. Similarly, consider ranks , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">, ,¬†¬†¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¬†¬†¬†, , , ,, ,,,¬†¬†¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.
A set of primitive parts and the transformations of those parts into other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> is a ‚Äútechnology graph.‚Äù In fact, a technology graph is deeply similar to a chemical-reaction bipartite graph from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set of organic molecules, where the molecules are the objects and the reaction hyperedges linking substrate and products are the transformations among the objects. The graph is ‚Äúbipartite‚Äù because there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, nodes, and hyperedges, representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and transformations.
The first thing to notice about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> World technology graph is that it might extend o to infinity, given an infinite number of primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> parts.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thing to notice is that within <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> World an adjacent possible relative to any actual set of primitive and more complex <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> is perfectly definable. The adjacent possible is just that set of unique novel objects, not yet constructed, that can be constructed from the current set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects in a single construction step. Of course, within the limited world of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> we can think of the technologically adjacent possible from any actual. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> economy might flow persistently from simple primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> into the adjacent possible, building up evermore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> objects.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> feature is that we might consider specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> machines, made of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> parts, each able to carry out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the primitive gluing or ungluing operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lego World</ENAMEX> could build up the machine tools to build other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> including other tools.
Indeed, in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe</ENAMEX>, I borrowed theoretical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Fontana‚</ENAMEX>Äôs algorithmic chemistry and defined a mathematical analogue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> World, namely a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgrammar model‚Äù</ENAMEX> of an economy. In that model, binary symbol strings represented goods and services, as do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lego World</ENAMEX>. In a grammar model, ‚Äúgrammar‚Äù specifies how symbol strings act on symbol strings, rather like machines on inputs, to produce new symbol strings. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lego World</ENAMEX>, the grammar is specified by the ways primitive blocks can be attached or unattached and by any designation of which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects can carry out which primitive construction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. The grammar in question may be simple and ‚Äúcontext-insensitive‚Äù or a far richer ‚Äúcontext-sensitive‚Äù grammar in which what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> can be added in what ways to dierent objects depends upon the small or large context surrounding those blocks. In short, in a context-sensitive grammar, the objects and transformations rules are sensitive to the context of the objects and previous transformations themselves.
Before proceeding with current uses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lego World</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectual children</ENAMEX>, notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> World, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">grammar models</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins and At Home</ENAMEX>, can become the locus of an economy, in which the sets of goods and services can expand over time and in which speciation and extinction events occur. In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins and At Home</ENAMEX>, I built upon a suggestion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Romer</ENAMEX>, and specified that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> string¬†¬†or here, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> object¬†¬†has some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> to a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX>. The utility of each object to the consumer is subjected to exponential discounting over time. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is worth more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> and still more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> from now. And for simplicity‚Äôs sake, the total utility of a bundle of goods is the sum of their discounted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX>.
Next, I invoked a ‚Äúsocial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The task of the social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> is to plan a pattern of production activities over time that optimizes the discounted happiness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX>. A standard approach is to adopt a finite planning horizon. The social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> thinks ahead, say, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> periods, finds that pattern of construction activities over time that creates the sequence of symbol-string goods, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects, that maximizes the time-discounted happiness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX>. Then, the social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> initiates the first-period plan, making the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. Next, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> considers a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-period planning horizon from period to period , deduces the optimal <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-period plan, taking account of the newly considered eleventh period, and carries out the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-period plan.
Because the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> to the consumer is a simple sum of the discounted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> of all the possible goods in the economy, finding the optimal plan at any period is just a linear programming problem, and the results are a fixed ratio of construction activities of all the objects produced at that period. The fixed ratio of the activities is the mirror of price, relative to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> good, taken as the arbitrary <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúcurrency,‚Äù or ‚Äúnumeraire</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Over time, the model economy ticks forward. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX> period, in general, only some of the possible goods and services are constructed. The others do not make the consumer happy enough. Over time, new goods and services come into existence, and old ones go out of existence in small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction events.
Thus, a grammar model, or a physical instantiation of a grammar model such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> World, is a toy world with a technology graph of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and transformations. With the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> to the dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX> or a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and a social planner¬†¬†or more generally, with a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> for the objects that may dier among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> and with dierent costs and scaling of costs with sizes of production runs of dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects¬†¬†a market economy can be constructed. With defined start-up costs, costs of borrowing money, and bankruptcy rules, a model economy with an evolving set of goods and services can be created and studied.
In general, such economies will advance persistently into the adjacent possible. And because the number of unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects in each rank is larger than the number in the preceding rank, the diversity of opportunities and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> tends to increase as ever more complex objects are constructed.
More generally, we need to consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúcomplements‚Äù and ‚Äúsubstitutes</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Screw</ENAMEX> and screwdriver are complements; screw and nail are substitutes. Complements must be used together to create value; substitutes replace one another. Rather obviously, the complements and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> of any good or service constitute the economic niche in which that good or service lives. New goods enter the economy, typically, as complements and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> for existing goods. There is just no point in inventing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> changer before the television set is invented and television programming is developed.
An economic web is just the set of goods and services in an economy, linked by red <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> between substitutes and green lines between complements.
As we have seen, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past million years</TIMEX>, and even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past hundred years</TIMEX>, the diversity of the economic web has increased. Why? Because, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lego World</ENAMEX>, the more objects there are in the economy, the more complement and substitute relations exist among those objects, as well as potential new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in the adjacent possible. If there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> objects, the number of potential complement or substitute relations scales at least as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> squared since each object might be a complement or substitute of any object. Thus, as the diversity of the objects in the web increases, the diversity of prospective niches for new goods and services increases even more rapidly! The very diversity of the economic web is autocatalytic.
If this view is correct, then diversity of goods and services is a major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> of economic growth. Indeed, I believe that the role of diversity of goods and services is the major unrecognized factor driving economic growth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Jacobs</ENAMEX> had made the same point in her thoughtful books about the relation between economic growth and economic diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and their hinterlands. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Scheinkman</ENAMEX>, now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of economics at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> studied a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, normalized for total capitalization, and found that economic growth correlated with economic diversity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. In a similar spirit, microfinancing of a linked diversity of cottage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> world and the first world seems to be achieving local economic growth where more massive eorts at education and infrastructure, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aswan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX> and power grids, seem to fail.
Indeed, in the same way in an ecosystem, organisms create niches for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. I suspect, therefore, that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>, the growth of diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is autocatalytic, for the number of possible niches increases more rapidly than the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> filling niches. And in the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes, the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible, driven by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence, are detected, are coupled to, and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>. Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a whole.
Think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> brothers‚Äô airplane. It was a recombination between an airfoil, a light gasoline engine, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle wheels</ENAMEX>, and a propeller. The more objects an economy has, the more novel objects can be constructed. When we were working with rough stone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Paleolithic</ENAMEX>, we pretty much mastered everything that could be done until pressure flaking came along. Most forms of simple stone tools that could be made were made. Today, the adjacent possible of goods and services is so vast that the economy, stumbling and lunging into the future adjacent possible, will only construct an ever smaller subset of the technologically possible.
The economy is ever more historically <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">contingent¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>. As the biosphere is ever more historically <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">contingent¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>. As, I suspect, the universe is ever more historically contingent.
We are on a trajectory, given a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> phase space, where the dimensionality of the adjacent possible does seem to increase secularly and the universe is not about to repeat itself in its nonergodic flow.
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law?
I now discuss an algorithmic model of the real economic web, the one outside in the bustling world of the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>, of mergers and acquisitions. While powerful, however, no algorithmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is complete, for neither the biosphere nor the econosphere is finitely prestatable. Indeed, the eort to design and construct an algorithmic model of the real economic web will simultaneously help us see the weakness of any finite description.
It all hangs on object-oriented programming. 
A case in point is the recent advent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX>, an object-based language, which, as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> had a library of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some eighty thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodness</ENAMEX> knows how fast this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> is growing. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcarburetor‚Äù</ENAMEX> objects, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúengine block‚Äù</ENAMEX> objects, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúpiston‚Äù</ENAMEX> objects, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> come with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúfunctional‚Äù descriptors</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúis a,‚Äù ‚Äúhas a,‚Äù ‚Äúdoes a,‚Äù ‚Äúneeds a</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚Äúuses a.‚</ENAMEX>Äù
Both implicitly and, with modest work, explicitly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpiston‚Äù</ENAMEX> object can discover that it fits into the cylinder hole in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúengine block‚Äù</ENAMEX> object to create a completed piston in a cylinder. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcarburetor‚Äù</ENAMEX> object can discover that it is to be located on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúengine block‚Äù</ENAMEX> object, connected to certain ‚Äúgas line‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in certain ways.
The physical engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> and piston, in reality, are complements, used together to create value. Thus, the representations of the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> and piston as algorithmic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">algorithmic ‚Äúsearch engines‚Äù</ENAMEX> to match the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúis a,‚Äù ‚Äúhas a,‚Äù ‚Äúdoes a</ENAMEX>,‚Äù functions of complements and even substitutes, can as a matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">principle¬†¬†and practicality¬†¬†create</ENAMEX> an image of the real complements and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX> in the real economic web.
In a fundamental sense, an appropriate set of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects, together with search engines for complements and substitutes matching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúis a,‚Äù ‚Äúhas a,‚Äù ‚Äúdoes a</ENAMEX>,‚Äù constitutes a grammar of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and linkings or transformations among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. The grammar may be context independent or context sensitive or richer.
In short, properly carried out, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects and the proper search engines can create a technology graph of all the objects and transformed objects constructible from any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects are like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> World. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> World, stated in terms of building simple combinatorial objects, is logically similar to a set of objectives that must be achieved by a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to carry out its total objective. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Entities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are deeply similar, as we will explore further below. Technology graphs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> objects and actions, things and objectives, products and processes in a single framework.
Therefore, in principle, we have begun to specify a means to characterize large patches of the global economic web. Let each of very many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, at dierent levels of disaggregation, create <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects proper to their activities, building materials, partially processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>, partially achieved objectives, and objectives including products. Let these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects be characterized by appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúis a,‚Äù ‚Äúhas a,‚Äù ‚Äúdoes a</ENAMEX>,‚Äù lists, with adequate search engines looking for complements and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX>. The result is a distributed web of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Java</ENAMEX> objects linked functionally in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least many</TIMEX> or most of the ways that are actually in use as complements and substitutes creating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions</NUMEX> of dierent goods and services in the current economy.
Much is of interest about such data on the real economic web. Among other features, any such graph has graph-typical characteristics. Some goods are central to the web, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, computer, and so forth. Others are peripheral, such as the hula hoop and pet rock. Presumably, location of its products in the web structure has a great deal to do with the strategic position of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>.
But there is more, for the economic web <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> its own adjacent possible. Given the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Mary</ENAMEX> and an umbrella, the umbrella placed in the smoke stack of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Mary</ENAMEX> is in the adjacent possible. Not much use. But what about a small umbrella on the back of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> that opens upon landing: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ah</ENAMEX>, an air brake is a possible new good in the adjacent possible a few steps from here.
And still more. What are the statistics of the transformation of an economic web over time as new goods and services arise in the niches aorded by existing goods and services, and drive old goods and services extinct? No one makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> siege engines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cruise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> do the job better.
I believe such object-based economic web tools will come into existence in the near future. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bios Group</ENAMEX> is involved in inventing and making them. And I believe that such tools will be very powerful means of coordinating activities within supply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and within the larger economy when linked by automated markets.
But I do not believe any such algorithmic tool can be complete. Consider the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> discovering that the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> is so rigid that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> itself can serve as the chassis for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> they are trying to invent. That exaptation seems a genuine discovery. Now imagine that we had had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX> object models of all the parts that were to go into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX>: engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> objects, carburetor objects, piston objects. If, among the properties of the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">block¬</ENAMEX>†¬†the proud <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúis a,‚Äù ‚Äúhas a,‚Äù ‚Äúdoes a</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù features¬†¬†we</ENAMEX> had not listed ahead of time the very rigidity of the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> or if that rigidity was not deducible from the other listed properties, then my vaunted economic web <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with its algorithmically accessible adjacent possible could not have ever come up with the suggestion: Use the engine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX>, due to its rigidity, as the chassis.
You see again that unless there is a finite predescription of all the potentially relevant properties of a real physical object, our algorithmic approach can be powerful, but incomplete. Yet I cannot see how to construct such a finite predescription of all the potentially relevant properties of a real physical object in the real universe.
The world is richer than all our dreams, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Horatio</ENAMEX>.
I must say to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Debreu, ‚ÄúGentlemen</ENAMEX>, the set of goods and services is not finitely prestatable, so fixed-point theorems are of limited use.‚Äù
And to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist colleagues</ENAMEX>: Consider the economy as forever becoming, burgeoning with new ways of making a living, new ways of creating value and advantages of trade, while old ways go extinct. This too is the proper subject for your study, not just allocation of scarce resources and achievement of market-clearing prices. The economy, like the biosphere, is about persistent creativity in ways of making a living.
I find it intriguing to note certain parallels from our prior discussion of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. At the level of molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, I made the point repeatedly that work is the constrained release of energy and that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> do carry out work to construct the constraints on the release of energy such that the energy is released along specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and such that specific couplings of nonequilibrium energy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> arise. Think then of the role of laws and contracts, whose constraints enable the linked flow of economic activities down particular corridors of activities. The web of economic activities flows down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> whose constraints are largely legal in nature. The coming into existence of the enabling constraints of law is as central to economic development and growth as any other aspect of the bubbling activity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robust Constructibility</ENAMEX>
My first purpose in investing in an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legos</ENAMEX> was to explore and define concepts of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúrobust constructibility</ENAMEX>.‚Äù We have succeeded, but run into fascinating problems of a general phase transition in problem solvability. In turn, this very phase transition suggests that in a coconstructing biosphere or econosphere rather specific restrictions arise and are respected by critters and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognoscenti</ENAMEX>.
Recall the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set, and the rings, rank , rank ,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>, rank ,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,¬†¬†¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">¬†¬†¬†each</ENAMEX> containing the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> constructible from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set in a number of steps equal to the rank of that ring. Suppose a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> constructible in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> steps, hence, lies in rank . Now, it might be the case that there is a single construction pathway from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> steps. It might also be the case that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of construction pathways to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> steps. In the latter case, intuitively, construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is robust. If one way is blocked, say because x blocks are temporarily used up, then a neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> will allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to be constructed without delay, that is, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> steps, using other block sizes.
A related sense of robustly constructibility concerns how the number of ways to construct the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> increases if we take more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the minimum twenty</TIMEX> steps, say, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†steps</ENAMEX>. The number of ways may not increase at all or very slowly or hyperexponentially. If the number of ways increases very rapidly, it might be worth using <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> steps to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, for it would be virtually impossible to block construction even if several types of building blocks and machines were temporarily broken.
But recall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing‚</ENAMEX>Äôs question. They wanted to build a family of related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>. Hence, let us define still another related sense of robustly constructible.
Consider a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> objects, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a chimney. Now consider each of the many ways from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. For each such way to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, consider how to change construction minimally in order to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney. Perhaps the chimney can just be added to the completed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. More likely, it would be necessary to partially deconstruct that completed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, then go on to construct the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney. So there is a last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point during construction on the way both to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point object and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> that is simultaneously on the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney is an interesting intermediate-complexity object or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> because it is polyfunctional. It can be used in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> further ways.
When we build a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, we all know that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> and nails are primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and the completed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is the finished object. But some intermediate objects, say, framed windows and framed walls, are commonly used. Why? Because they are intermediate objects that are polyfunctional. The technology graph and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> points are identifying the intermediate-complexity polyfunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> for us.
But things are more subtle. It might be the case that from the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point on a way to make both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney there is only a single pathway forward to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and there is only a single pathway forward to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney. Not robust. Stupid stopping spot. Either pathway can readily be blocked. Suppose instead we consider an intermediate object <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps prior to the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> point on the way outward from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set. Ah, perhaps there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of ways to complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and to complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney. Any single blockage or small set of blockages is readily overcome. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney, can be built without delay if all  x blocks are temporarily out of stock. Now this is a smart, robust, intermediate-complexity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polyfunctional</ENAMEX> object-objective. And it may cost no more to stockpile such smart intermediate objects!
So, here is a new view of process design and inventory control.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bios</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Herriot</ENAMEX> has made a delightful little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Java</ENAMEX> computer model to show technology graphs in action. The program shows a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúchair‚Äù</ENAMEX> object, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúseat‚Äù</ENAMEX> object, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúback‚Äù</ENAMEX> object, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúleg‚Äù</ENAMEX> object. In addition, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúfoam‚Äù and ‚Äúpadding‚Äù</ENAMEX> objects, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ‚Äúattachment‚Äù objects, a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúscrew‚Äù objects, ‚Äúnail‚Äù objects, ‚Äúwood‚Äù</ENAMEX> objects, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsaw‚Äù</ENAMEX> object, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhammer‚Äù</ENAMEX> object, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúscrewdriver‚Äù</ENAMEX> object. Each object comes with its own characteristic set of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúis a,‚Äù ‚Äúhas a,‚Äù ‚Äúdoes a</ENAMEX>,‚Äù features.
The program assembles coherent technology graphs and chair-assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> as follows: An object tries a connection, shown by a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX>, to another object. In eect, the chair object extends a line to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">screw</ENAMEX> object as it says, ‚ÄúI need a lean-on! I need a lean-on!‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">screw</ENAMEX> object responds, ‚ÄúI do twist holds, I do twist holds!‚Äù There is no match. After many random tries, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúchair‚Äù</ENAMEX> object extends a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúback‚Äù</ENAMEX> object. ‚ÄúI need a lean-on, I need a lean-on,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúchair‚Äù</ENAMEX> object. ‚ÄúI do lean-ons, I do lean-ons,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù cries the ‚Äúback‚Äù</ENAMEX> object with cybernetic joy. The black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> becomes a yellow line as a contract is signed between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúchair‚Äù and ‚Äúback‚Äù</ENAMEX> objects. In a similar way, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúback‚Äù object needs ‚Äúpadding‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúwood‚Äù</ENAMEX> objects, and either the complementary pair ‚Äúnail and hammer‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> or their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substitutes</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúscrew and screwdriver‚Äù objects, to carry out an ‚Äúattachment‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>.
In due course, the conditions are met to begin construction of partial objects on the way to the entire chair. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legs</ENAMEX>, then backs, begin to be assembled as screws and nails are used up. Eventually, a seat is constructed too, and the first chair triumphantly follows.
All goes well until all the screws are used up. The seat, having relied on screws and screwdrivers to attach padding, goes nuts and looks about frantically, asking the screwdriver to work on nails. No luck. Eventually, the seat tries nails and hammers jointly, and that complementary pair works. More chairs are constructed, then nails run out and failures propagate throughout the system.
Not a metaphor, the technology graph. Rather, a new tool to understand the general principles of robust constructibility, the structure of economic webs, a knowledge-management tool for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX>, a new hunk of basic science. Indeed, one of the interesting features of technology graphs is that they constitute the proper conceptual framework to consider process and product design simultaneously. As far as I can tell, we have not had such a conceptual framework before.
Nor is the technology graph limited to manufacturing. The same general principles apply, for example, in military or other logistic operations. Technology graphs, in these other contexts, become the sequential set of requirements needed to meet subobjectives that robustly culminate in the achievement of an overall objective. Taking hill after diverting gracefully from orders to take hill is logically related to making the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the chimney after starting to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> without the chimney.
A Phase Transition in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Problem</ENAMEX> Solvability
Part of the basic science of technology graphs stems from generic phase transitions in problem solvability in many combinatorial optimization or satisficing problems in biology and economics. I turn now to discuss these generic phase transitions.
I begin with a metaphor. You are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>. A yellow bromine fog is present. Anyone in the fog for more than a microsecond will die. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> regimes: the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúdead,‚Äù the ‚Äúliving dead,‚Äù and the ‚Äúsurvivable</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdead‚Äù</ENAMEX>: The bromine fog is higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, everyone dies.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúliving dead‚Äù</ENAMEX>: The bromine fog has drifted lower and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eiger</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matterhorn</ENAMEX> jut into the sunlight. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hikers</ENAMEX> near these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> peaks are alive.
But consider that even mountains are not fixed. Plate tectonics can deform the mountainous landscape. Or, in the terms of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, the mountainous fitness landscape of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> or an armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> can change and persistently deform due to coevolution when other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX> change strategies. If the mountainous landscape deforms, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eiger</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matterhorn</ENAMEX> will eventually dip into the bromine fog. As this happens, perhaps new peaks jut into the sunshine. But those peaks will typically be far away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eiger</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matterhorn</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> near those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> initial peaks will die as they are dipped into the lethal fog and are too far from the newly emerged sun drenched peaks to reach them. This ‚Äúisolated peaks regime‚Äù is the living dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
But there is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> a phase transition away.
The survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>: Let the bromine fog drift lower. More and more peaks jut into the sunshine. At some point, some magical point, as more peaks emerge into the sunshine, quite suddenly, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hiker</ENAMEX> can walk all the way across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> in the sunshine.
This is a phase transition from the isolated peaks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. A connected web¬†¬†mathematically, a percolating <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">web¬†¬†of connected ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù</ENAMEX> has emerged suddenly as the fog lowers. Now consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> striding across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>, knapsacks and hearts full. If plate tectonics rather slowly deforms the landscape, then whenever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> are about to be dipped into the lethal bromine fog, they can take a sideways step in some direction and remain in the sunshine.
The percolating web of solutions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> is persistently survivable. In fitness landscape terms, if you are evolving on a fitness landscape that is deforming and are in your survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, you can continue to exist by stepping somewhere from wherever you happen to find yourself.
This phase transition is generic to hard combinatorial optimization problems. A case in point is the well-known job shop problem. The job shop problem posits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> machines and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> objects. The idea is to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">O</ENAMEX> objects on the machines. Each object requires being on each machine in some set order for some fixed period of time. Perhaps object must be on machine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, then machine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, then machine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. In turn, object must be on machine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, then machine for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, and so on.
A schedule is an assignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> to machines such that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> are constructed. The total length of time it takes to construct the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmakespan</ENAMEX>.‚Äù We may consider, for each schedule, a definition of neighboring schedules, such as swapping the order in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> are assigned to a given machine. Given the set of possible schedules, the neighborhood relation between schedules, and the makespan of each schedule, there is a makespan fitness landscape over the space of schedules of the job shop problem.
We want to minimize makespan. But to keep our mountainous landscape metaphor where high peaks are good, let us consider optimizing eciency by minimizing makespan. So schedules with low makespan correspond to points of high eciency on the job-shop fitness landscape. Clearly, short makespan makes the problem hard, long makespan makes the problem easy. So long makespan is like the bromine fog being low, while short makespan is like the bromine fog being high.
Does the phase transition occur in typical job shop problems as makespan is tuned from long to short? Figure . shows the results <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vince Darley</ENAMEX> obtained. The figure plots makespan, short to long, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis and the number of schedules at a given makespan on the y-axis.
As you can see, for long enough makespan, as makespan decreases there are roughly a constant number of schedules at each makespan. But at a critically short makespan, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> starts to fall abruptly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX> where the curve starts to turn is the phase transition between the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> for longer makespans and the isolated peaks/living dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> for shorter makespans. (I cheat slightly, the sharpness of the corner increases as the size of the job shop problem increases in numbers of machines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, and objects, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">O.</ENAMEX>)
There are a number of direct tests for this phase transition. In the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer makespans</TIMEX> and lower eciency than the phase transition makespan, start with a given schedule at a given makespan. Now examine all ‚Äúnearby‚Äù schedules and test if any is of an equal or better makespan. Continue to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúwalk‚Äù across the space of schedules via <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> to test if there is a connected web of schedules with makespans at least as good as our initial schedule‚Äôs makespan. Either the web percolates across the space of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> or it does not. If the web percolates, then the initial schedule was in the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. If only isolated regions of neighboring schedules of the same approximate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makespan</ENAMEX> are found, then you are in the isolated peaks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> test looks at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúHausdorf dimensionality‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the acceptable solutions at a given makespan or better. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hausdorf</ENAMEX> dimension is computed by considering an initial schedule at a given makespan, then by considering from among all the -mutant neighbor schedules the number of them that are of the same or better makespan as the initial schedule‚Äôs makespan, then doing the same among all the -mutant neighbor schedules. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hausdorf</ENAMEX> dimension of the acceptable set of schedules at that makespan and point in the job shop space is the ratio of the logarithm of the -mutant acceptable schedules to the logarithm of the -mutant acceptable schedules. In eect, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hausdorf</ENAMEX> dimension shows how rapidly¬†¬†in how many dimensions of the job-shop schedule space¬†¬†acceptable schedules of a given makespan or better are growing. In the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hausdorf</ENAMEX> dimension, on average, is greater than .. In the isolated peaks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, averaged over the job shop space, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hausdorf</ENAMEX> dimension is less than .. At the phase transition, the dimensionality is ..
The phase transition I have just noted is generic for many or most hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is not true for all fitness landscapes. For example, it would not hold on a conical Fujiyama landscape. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fuji</ENAMEX> landscape corresponds to a simple, typically linear, optimization problem. Hard combinatorial optimization problems are multipeaked due to conflicting constraints.
A further interesting connection relates the statistics of search on the job shop landscape to learning curves in economics. Learning curves, well known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">arenas</ENAMEX> from airplane manufacture to diamond cutting to cigar manufacture, show that every time the total output of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is doubled, the cost per unit falls by a rough constant percentage, typically to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX>. If the logarithm of the cost per unit is plotted on the y-axis and the logarithm of the cumulative number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> produced is plotted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis, one gets a typical straight-line power law that decreases downward to the right.
The fascinating thing is that this feature probably reflects the statistics of search for fitter variants on rugged, correlated fitness landscapes such as the job shop problem. Typically, in such problems, every time a fitter -mutant variant is found, the fraction of -mutant variants that are still fitter falls by a constant fraction, while the improvement achieved at each step is typically a constant fraction of the improvement achieved at the last step. These properties yield the learning curve. My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Lobo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Auerswald</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karl Shell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Macready</ENAMEX>, and I have published a number of papers on the application of the statistics of rugged landscapes and learning curves.
But there is another even more important point. We can control the statistical structure of the problem spaces we face such that the problem space is more readily solvable. We can, and do, tune the structure of the problems we solve. The capacity to tune landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> shows up in the job shop problem. In most cases, improving the structure of the problem space requires relaxing conflicting constraints to move the problem into the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> at the makespan, or eciency, you require. For a specific case, in my statement of the job shop problem, I asserted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">O</ENAMEX> objects must each have access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> machines in some fixed order.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Now</TIMEX> simple observation and experience tells you that you can put on your shirt and pants in either order, but you had better put on your socks before your shoes. In other words, some steps in life are permutable, others are not. Suppose in our job shop problem, a fixed fraction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>, of the steps in the construction of each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">O</ENAMEX> objects were jointly permutable. As P increases and more steps are permutable, the conflicting constraints in the total problem are reduced. But this in turn means that the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> of solutions improves, that is, the entire space shifts toward lower makespan, or higher eciency.
And now the relation to the bromine fog metaphor can be stated clearly. As the number of permutable steps increases, the conflicting constraints are reduced. The entire makespan-eciency landscape is lifted higher, the peaks are higher, and the landscape, with fewer conflicting constraints, is smoother. All in all, the result is that the percolating web of solutions where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> can walk all across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> occurs at a higher eciency and shorter makespan.
In terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Figure .</ENAMEX>, the capacity to permute steps in the job shop problem shifts the phase transition point leftward, toward shorter makespan. Equivalently, if one wants to shift the curve in Figure . to the left, purchase a computable number of machines that are polyfunctional so that the same machine can be used for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> job. That too reduces conflicting constraints.
There is another view of this generic phase transition between solvable and nonsolvable that again highlights the role of having alternative ways of doing things, robustly constructible strategies that are not easily blocked. In addition, the same simple model, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ksat</ENAMEX> model discussed in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, begins to account for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the following</TIMEX> anecdotal observation, which is apparently typical: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colleagues</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> noted to us that if they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> that manufactures dierent types of a product, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toothpaste</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> does well when the diversity of products grows from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty to twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, but at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> dierent toothpastes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> suddenly fails. So rather abruptly, as product diversity in a given plant increases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> fails. 
Why? Presumably it is the same phase transition in problem solvability.
Consider again the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ksat</ENAMEX> problem, taken as a model for community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> in the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> based on the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Sawhill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Keitt</ENAMEX>. Figure . repeats the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ksat</ENAMEX> problem and shows again the phase transition.
Recall that a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ksat</ENAMEX> problem consists in a logical statement with V variables, in C clauses, in normal disjunctive form: (A v A) and (A v A) and (not A v A). As we discussed in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, a normal disjunctive expression with C clauses, V variables in total, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> variables per clause is satisfiable if there is an assignment of true or false to each of the V variables, such that the expression as a whole is true.
The normal disjunctive form makes it clear that as there is an increase in the number of alternative ways, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, of carrying out a task, or making a clause true, it is easier to satisfy the combined expression. More generally, as noted in the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> and shown in Figure ., there is a phase transition in the probability that a random Ksat expression with V variables, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> per clause, and C clauses can be satisfied by some assignment of true or false to the V variables. The phase transition occurs in the horizontal axis, labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/V</ENAMEX>, which is the mean number of clauses in which any variable occurs. Obviously, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/V</ENAMEX> increases, conflicting constraints increase. The phase transition from easily solvable to virtually impossible to solve occurs at a point on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/V</ENAMEX> axis equal to log x raised to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> power, or . x <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Hence</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> increases, the phase transition shifts outward to greater <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/V</ENAMEX> values.
But Figure . gives us an intuitive understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever‚</ENAMEX>Äôs problem, in fact, the problem is far more general than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Unilever‚Äôs</ENAMEX> assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Think of each clause, (A v A), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> cetera, as a way to make one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toothpaste products</ENAMEX>, and think of the conjunction, (A v A) and (A v A) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">and¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>, as the way to make all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> toothpastes. Then as the number of clauses, hence <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toothpaste products</ENAMEX>, increases for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> with V variables to use in making these dierent products, all of a sudden the conjoint problem will have so many conflicting constraints that it will cross the phase transition from solvable to insolvable.
Moreover, for any given number of clauses and V variables, if a given assignment of true or false to the V variables satisfies the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ksat</ENAMEX> problem, we can ask if any of the -mutant neighbor assignments of true and false to the V variables that change the truth value assigned to one of the V variables also satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ksat</ENAMEX> problem. Thus, we can study the phase transition from a survivable percolating web of solutions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/C</ENAMEX> is lower to an isolated peaks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> as V/C increases to virtual impossibility for high V/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>
Thus, just as in the job shop problem, as product diversity increases for a fixed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, a phase transition from survivable to unsurvivable will occur because the conflicting constraints will increase with C/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX> The resulting landscape becomes more rugged, the peaks lower, the yellow bromine fog rises from the survivable to the living dead to the dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, covering <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX> and all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> (Figure .).
But this takes us back to the technology graph and robust constructibility. Recall from above that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a chimney might be robustly constructible from wisely chosen intermediate-complexity objects on the pathway to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of ways to get there. At no extra cost, we might choose to stockpile that intermediate-complexity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polyfunctional</ENAMEX> object rather than another choice.
But intermediate-complexity polyfunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> are just what allows multiple pathways, multiple permutations of construction steps to our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> final objects. Hence, these same smart intermediate objects reduce the conflicting constraints in the fitness landscape over the construction space to make our desired set of objects, or our set of toothpastes. Lowering the conflicting constraints makes the eciency peaks of the fitness landscapes higher, hence, allows survivable operations at a higher level of product diversity.
Thus, by use of the technology graph to design both products and processes, we can choose a family of products and construction pathways with highly redundant intermediate objects. That choice makes the problem space easy to solve rather than hard to solve. We have thereby tuned the statistical structure of our problem space into a survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, we can test whether our choice of construction pathways to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a chimney is robustly survivable or in the living dead‚Äìisolated peaks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. We need merely use the technology graph to test for percolating sets of -mutant neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> of construction of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> and the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hausdorf</ENAMEX> dimension of such pathways.
No need to operate in the isolated peaks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Indeed, if you face loss of parts and machines, you had best locate back from the phase transition, deep enough into the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> to survive. And if you are a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> fighting against an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> whose strategy changes persistently deform your payo landscape and whose eorts are to destroy your capacity to fight, you had best operate even further back from the phase transition in the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the normal disjunctive form in Figure . is a rough image of the complexity of a campaign you can fight¬†¬†the number of clauses that must be jointly satisfied to meet your objectives, where each clause is a subobjective and there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> alternative ways to meet that objective using V <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon systems</ENAMEX>.
Just as warfare and the economy as a whole have much in common, warfare and the biosphere have much in common. If you are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species coevolving</ENAMEX> with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, you had best operate back from the phase transition well into the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
There is a message: If you must make a living, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sake, make your problem space survivable!
This brings us back to a point made in early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>. Recall the no-free-lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorem</ENAMEX> proved by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Macready</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wolpert</ENAMEX>. Given a family of all possible fitness landscapes, on average, no search algorithm outperforms any other search algorithm. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> climbing is, on average, no better than random search in finding high peaks, when averaged over all possible fitness landscapes.
The no-free-lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorem</ENAMEX> led me to wonder about the following: We organisms use mutation, recombination, and selection in evolution, and we pay twofold fitness for sex and recombination to boot. But recombination is only a useful search procedure on smooth enough fitness landscapes where the high peaks snuggle rather near one another.
In turn, this led me to wonder where such nice fitness landscapes arise in evolution, for not all fitness landscapes are so blessedly smooth. Some are random. Some are anticorrelated.
In turn, this led me to think about and discuss natural games, or ways of making a living. Since ways of making a living evolve with the organisms making those livings, we got to the winning games are the games the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> play. Which led me to suggest that those ways of making a living that are well searched out and exploited by the search mechanisms organisms happen to use¬†¬†mutation, recombination, and selection¬†¬†will be ways of making a living that are well populated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and similar species. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways</ENAMEX> of making a living that cannot be well searched out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and their mutation recombination search procedures will not be well populated.
So we came to the reasonable conclusion that a biosphere of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> is a self-consistently self-constructing whole, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, ways of making a living, and ways of searching for how to make a living all work together to coconstruct the biosphere. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Happily</ENAMEX>, we are picking the problems we can manage to solve. Of course, if we could not solve our chosen ways to make livings, we would be dead.
And there is, I think, a molecular clue that the biosphere is persistently coconstructing itself in the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> for a propagating set of lineages. We have just characterized the survivable percolating web <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> where the fitness landscape of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> deforms due to the adaptive moves of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>, but there are always neighboring ways of surviving. Genetically, those neighboring ways are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or a few mutations or recombinations away from where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is right now. If the biosphere has coconstructed itself such that most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are in a survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, then as coevolution occurs, most species will persist but may well transform, for example, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> species. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> would guess that this mildly turbulent process is rather continuous, perhaps with some self-organized critical bursts on a power law scale.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmolecular clock hypothesis‚</ENAMEX>Äù seems to fit these facts. If one compares hemoglobins from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, chimps, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>, and so on, in general, the longer ago we diverged from one another in the evolutionary record, the more amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> mutations distinguish the hemoglobins of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> involved. Our hemoglobin is very similar to chimp hemoglobin and quite dierent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX>. So good is this correlation that, within given protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, it is argued that mutations accumulate with timelike clockwork, hence the molecular clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hypothesis</ENAMEX>, in which a number of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid dierences</ENAMEX> can be taken as a surrogate for time from the most common ancestor. Dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family clocks seem to run at dierent rates.
There is evidence that the clock does not run quite smoothly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gillespie</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population biologist</ENAMEX> now at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at Davis</ENAMEX>, showed some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> that amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> substitutions seemed to come in short bursts that accumulate over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long</TIMEX> periods of time to a rough molecular clock that ‚Äústutters.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Gillespie</ENAMEX> argued that fitness landscapes were episodically shifting and the bursts of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> were adaptive runs toward nearby newly formed peaks. I agree and suggest that the near accuracy of the molecular clock data over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and virtually all species strongly suggests that the biosphere has coconstructed itself such that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, even as they speciate and go extinct, are, as lineages, in the persistently survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
We as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> have, in fact, constructed our ways of making a living such that those problem spaces are typically, but not always, solvable as coevolution proceeds. And, on average, the same thing holds for the econosphere. As old ways of making a living go extinct, new ones persistently enter. We too, it appears, have coconstructed our econosphere such that our ways of making a living, and discovering new ways of making a living, are manageable, probably in a self-organized critical manner, with small and large speciation and extinction events.
And there is a corollary: If you are lucky enough to be in the survivable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, you can survive by being adaptable. What is required to be adaptable as an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>? We discussed this in the last chapter. A good guess is that an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> needs to be poised in an ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, near the edge of chaos, where a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of change propagates through the system such that it optimizes the persistent balance between exploration and exploitation on ever-shifting, coevolving fitness landscapes.
Laws for any biosphere extend, presumably, to laws for any economy. Nor should that be surprising. The economy is based on advantages of trade. But those advantages accrue no more to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> exchanging <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> than to root nodules and fungi exchanging <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> and fixed nitrogen such that both make enhanced livings. Thus, economics must partake of the vast creativity of the universe. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecules</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and economic systems are advancing into an adjacent possible. In all cases, one senses a secular trend for diversity to increase, hence for the dimensionality of the adjacent possible to increase in our nonergodic journey.
Perhaps again we glimpse a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law.
