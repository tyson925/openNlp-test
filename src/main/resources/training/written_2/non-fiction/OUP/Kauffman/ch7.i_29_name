The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonergodic Universe</ENAMEX>:
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Possibility of New Laws</ENAMEX>
rom a biosphere and its mysteries, this investigation now steps gingerly toward the cosmos. Caveat lector: I am not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX>.
Our now familiar liter of gas particles at room temperature comes to equilibrium rapidly, certainly on the order of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúEquilibrium‚Äù</ENAMEX> means, roughly, that the macroscopic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the system, such as temperature and pressure, have stopped changing, except for small ‚Äúsquare root <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N‚</ENAMEX>Äù fluctuations away from equilibrium that soon dissipate back toward equilibrium. As we have noted, thanks to the ergodic hypothesis, the gas system ultimately visits each macrostate at a number of times proportional to the number of microstates in that macrostate. For equilibrium with respect to all macroscopic properties to have been attained, it is not necessary that all microstates have been sampled, of course, but that the statistical distribution of microstates approaches the equilibrium distribution.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Physicist Richard Feynman</ENAMEX> noted that equilibrium is when ‚Äúall the fast things have happened, and the slow ones have not.‚Äù His dictum suggests, accurately, that the notion of equilibrium is not quite so self-evident.
The aim of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> is to explore the profound failure, on the scale of a suciently large closed thermodynamic system and, a fortiori, the open system of the biosphere, to come close to equilibrium on vastly long time scales with respect to the lifetime of the universe. The main facts are known to physicists, of course. The universe is vastly nonergodic above modest levels of molecular complexity, let alone with respect to gross motions of parts of the universe with respect to one another.
Given that the universe is actually nonergodic, nonrepeating, and in macroscopically important ways, over a time scale vastly longer than the lifetime of the universe, we are entitled to broach the question of whether there might be general laws governing some or all aspects of this nonergodic behavior. No one knows, but I will raise a possibility that has a chance to be true for a biosphere. There is little harm in wondering if it might hint at a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics for self-constructing systems such as biospheres.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Actual and the Adjacent Possible</ENAMEX>
I now want to reintroduce a central concept of alarming simplicity. Consider all the kinds of organic molecules on, within, or in the vicinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, say, out to twice the radius of the moon. Call that set of organic molecules the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúactual</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
Now recall the concept of a reaction graph, a bipartite graph with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nodes</ENAMEX> representing chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and lines called hyperedges leading from each set of substrates to a box and from the box to the product species of that particular reaction. Recall that we utilized arrows on the lines to distinguish substrates from products, but that the direction of flow of the reaction depended upon the displacement of the substrates and products of that reaction from the equilibrium concentrations for that reaction. That equilibrium ratio corresponds to the concentrations of substrates versus products, where the net rate of production of products from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">substrates</NUMEX> equals the net rate of production of substrates from products.
The reaction graph is just the set of all the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hyperedges</ENAMEX> representing all the reactions among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Thus, consider the reaction graph among the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the actual, where at present presumably <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of trillions</NUMEX> of molecular species exist.
Now consider the adjacent possible of the reaction graph of the actual. The adjacent possible consists of all those molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that are not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the actual, but are one reaction step away from the actual. That is, the adjacent possible comprises just those molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that are not present in the vicinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> out to twice the radius to the moon, but can be synthesized from the actual molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in a single reaction step from substrates in the actual to products in the adjacent possible.
Note that the adjacent possible is indefinitely expandable. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have been realized in the current adjacent possible, a new adjacent possible, accessible from the enlarged actual that includes the novel molecules from the former adjacent possible, becomes available.
Note that the biosphere has been expanding, on average, into the adjacent possible for . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>. Presumably, when life started there was a modest variety of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few tens</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundreds</NUMEX> of organic molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">species¬</ENAMEX>†¬†methane, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>, cyanide, the familiar list. If there are now a standing diversity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and each had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were at least slightly dierent from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in all other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, then, not counting molecular diversity within <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, the number of genes is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX>. Given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, polysaccharides, lipids, and other organic molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, the diversity is likely to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of trillions</NUMEX> or more.
Something has obviously happened in the past . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">biosphere</ENAMEX> has expanded, indeed, more or less persistently exploded, into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">ever-expanding</ENAMEX> adjacent possible. The secular diversity of organic molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has increased, on average, over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>.
It is more than slightly interesting that this fact is clearly true, that it is rarely remarked upon, and that we have no particular theory for this expansion. Indeed, I note for future reference that the standing diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the biosphere has, on average, with noticeable crashes in large extinction events, increased over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>. And among us mere <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the diversity of ways of making a living has increased dramatically over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past million years</TIMEX>, the past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred thousand</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and even over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past thousand years</TIMEX>. If you wanted a rabbit for dinner <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty thousand years ago</TIMEX>, you bloody well went out and caught a rabbit. Now most of us can go buy a rabbit dinner. Something again has happened. At the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and ways of making a living in the ‚Äúeconosphere,‚Äù the actual has expanded into a persistent adjacent possible.
We are all parts of the universe. So, in our little hunk of the universe, with the sun shining beatifically upon us, rather remarkable goings on have occurred. Indeed, the biosphere may be one of the most complex things in the universe.
Now a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> simple point. The molecular species of the actual exist. Those in the adjacent possible do not exist¬†¬†at least within the volume of the universe we are talking about, which we can expand in a moment to be the actual molecular diversity of the entire universe, not just our tiny patch of it.
The chemical potential of a single reaction with a single set of substrates and no products is perfectly definable, both the enthalpy and entropy. But we hardly need that sophistication. The substrates are present in the actual, and the products are not present in the actual, but only in the adjacent possible. It follows that every such reaction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> is displaced from its equilibrium in the direction of an excess of substrates compared to its products. This displacement constitutes a chemical potential driving the reaction toward equilibrium. The simple conclusion is that there is a real chemical potential from the actual to the adjacent possible. Other things being equal, the total system ‚Äúwants‚Äù to flow into the adjacent possible.
If there are to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX> organic molecules in the biosphere and each pair of organic molecules can undergo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one two</NUMEX> substrate‚Äìtwo product reaction, then the diversity of reactions is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX>, hence about x = . Some substantial fraction of these reactions flow from the actual to the adjacent possible. The total chemical potential from the actual into the adjacent possible is hard to estimate, but it is certainly not small.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonergodicity of the Universe</ENAMEX>
A further point is of fundamental importance, in my view. The universe, at levels of complexity of complex organic molecules, is vastly nonergodic.
Consider the number of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length . That is, we consider <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> made of the familiar kinds of standard encoded amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and, thus, linear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of such amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Since there are choices at each of positions, the number of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length is raised to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> power, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately</NUMEX> raised to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> power, .
Now let‚Äôs consider the estimated number of particles in the known universe, which is . Thus, the maximum number of pairwise collisions that could occur in any instant, ignoring distances between particles, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> squared, or . A fast reaction occurs in a femtosecond, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>. Then the number of pairwise collisions and reactions that can have occurred since the estimated time of the big bang <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen billion years ago</TIMEX> is times the number of femtoseconds since the big bang, which is about .
The total number of reactions on a femtosecond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">timescale</ENAMEX> cannot be larger than , a very very big number. But is infinitesimally small compared to the number of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length , namely, . In short, the known universe has not had time since the big bang to create all possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length once. Indeed the time required to create all possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at least once is at least the ratio of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to the maximum number of reactions that can have occurred in the lifetime of the universe, or times the lifetime of the universe.
Let that sink in. It would take at least to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> times the current lifetime of the universe for the universe to manage to make all possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length at least once. Obviously, with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length the universe is vastly nonergodic. It cannot have equilibrated over all these possible dierent molecules.
At a level of complexity above atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nuclei</ENAMEX>, once into the realm of complex molecules, the universe will not, cannot, come to equilibrium, on vastly long timescales compared to its historical age. Indeed, the giant cold molecular clouds in galaxies, about degrees absolute in temperature, are highly complex mixtures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX>, many carbonaceous, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>. We will return in a moment to wonder about whether a galaxy, considered as a closed thermodynamic system, reaches equilibrium chemically.
What about the arbitrary restriction to a femtosecond? The fastest known timescale is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck</ENAMEX> timescale, one in to the rd parts of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck</ENAMEX> timescale, therefore, the universe can have created at most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length compared to such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. It would take the known universe, chunking along on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck</ENAMEX> timescale, times its current lifetime to make all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length .
Now many biological <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are of length , or even amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Hence the number of possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of length does its now familiar hyperastronomical combinatorial explosion to or . The universe can have managed to make to the of these at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planck</ENAMEX> timescale.
Forget it. The universe is vastly nonequilibrium, vastly nonergodic at the level of complex organic molecules. A fortiori, the universe is vastly nonergodic at the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, languages, legal systems, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>.
It follows that, even if we consider the universe as a whole, at the levels of molecular and organizational complexity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and up, the universe is kinetically trapped. It has gotten where it has gotten from wherever it started, by whatever process of flow into a persistently expanding adjacent possible, but cannot have gotten everywhere. The ergodic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothesis</ENAMEX> fails us here on any relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timescale</ENAMEX>.
More, the biosphere, and the universe as a whole, may well be kinetically trapped into an evermore astonishingly small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> of the possible it might have reached. Stated otherwise, the set of actual small molecules and large molecules such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that do exist now is presumably an increasingly tiny subvolume of the total set that might have arisen by now in the biosphere or the universe since the big bang.
This nonergodicity is puzzling. Just what, for example, does this mean with respect to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law stating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thermodynamically</ENAMEX> isolated chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> approach equilibrium and their entropy increases to a maximum? In the familiar setting of a liter of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> at room temperature, equilibrium of macroscopic features is attained rapidly, and small macroscopic fluctuations such as deviation from chemical equilibrium among a fixed set of molecular species damp out fairly rapidly. By contrast, consider a giant cold molecular cloud in a spiral galaxy with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred million</NUMEX> solar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masses</ENAMEX>; ignore gravitational eects and just consider the ongoing complex chemical reactions on the complex dust particles that exist in those clouds. The specific molecular configurations that arise almost certainly include molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that are ever unique in the history of the universe. If we may consider unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> as macroscopic features of the cloud, then these fluctuations in macroscopic properties do not damp out; rather, they form the nexus for the generation of still new, unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX>. A specific cloud, like our biosphere, presumably becomes kinetically trapped into a very special set of complex molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that happen to have formed as the cloud evolves.
In short, since the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timescale</ENAMEX> for the ergodic hypothesis to hold is vastly longer than the actual present history of the universe, the macroscopic features of the universe with respect to the specific sets of complex molecules that exist on this planet¬†¬†in giant cold molecular clouds, and so forth¬†¬†are kinetically trapped into an infinitesimal subset of those molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that might have come into existence in an ensemble of dierent histories of the universe.
My quip above about the nonergodicity of the universe with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, languages, legal systems, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> was not a jest. We noted in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> can form <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hierarchies¬†¬†hypercycles</ENAMEX> made of replicators linked in a cycle of mutual benefit are but the simplest case. The symbiotic construction of eukaryotic cells by merging of dierent bacterial forms to create mitochondria and chloroplasts and perhaps cell nuclei are another case. So too are multicelled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> such as starfish and ourselves. These hierarchically complex autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> have, do, and will invade an adjacent possible, definable at least at the chemical level, but also on morphological levels, behavioral levels, and beyond. At all levels, the biosphere has been invading a persistent adjacent possible for . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>.
Which leads to an odd thought: The indefinite hierarchy upward in complexity is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsink‚Äù</ENAMEX> where the burgeoning order of the universe constructed by such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> can be ‚Äúdumped.‚Äù The biosphere has been doing this dumping for . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>.
Now here are some further odd thoughts. There is an absolute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> temperature. You cannot get colder than absolute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, where the only motions are quantum in nature. Because there is an absolute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>, and the extraction of work via the use of heat dierences, as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnot</ENAMEX> cycle, requires dumping heat from a hotter to a colder reservoir, such ‚Äúwork cycles‚Äù require an ever colder sink and are bound to arrest at absolute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. So, more or less, follows the dreaded ‚Äúheat death‚Äù of the universe.
On the other hand, as we have just seen, the universe is vastly nonergodic at levels of complexity of complex organic molecules upward to autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> coevolving with one another and beyond. There appears to be no upper bound on this complexity¬†¬†there is no obvious upper bound that limits this sink, as absolute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> limits work cycles in heat engines. So it may begin to be worth raising the question whether the universe can expand into an adjacent possible for vastly longer periods than the current lifetime of the universe, becoming evermore kinetically trapped, thus evermore specific and more refinely dierentiated.
Formalizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adjacent Possible</ENAMEX>
It is helpful to attempt to formalize the concept of the adjacent possible. I will do so using classical physics and the now familiar concept of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> phase space. Recall that our particles in the liter box had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> positional variables and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> momenta, or velocity variables, hence, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> numbers per particle. For an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> particle system, this is the familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> phase space.
Let‚Äôs just go ahead and define the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> phase space for a region of real space, including the sphere centered on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> out to twice the orbit of the moon and containing the positions and momenta of all particles from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> out to twice the orbit of the moon. Physicists always assure us that this makes sense. As usual, we can break this classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> phase space into a very large number of tiny ‚Äúcells,‚Äù each also N-dimensional. At any moment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>-centered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> system, call it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúEarth</ENAMEX> system,‚Äù is in one of these tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, or microstates. Over time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> system¬†¬†or a larger one including the entire solar system or our galaxy or the local cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">galaxies¬†¬†flows</ENAMEX> from microstate to microstate. By our arguments above and ignoring gravity¬†¬†a grave mistake in itself¬†¬†clearly our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> system has and will flow nonergodically in this phase space for vastly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long time</TIMEX> periods.
Now, the total adjacent possible to the current microstate of our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> system is just the total number of microstates that are adjacent to our current microstate. And that number is very large indeed, for it is on the order of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Say</ENAMEX> there are particles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> system, a very crude guess, then the total number of adjacent possible microstates is about raised to the to the st power. In short, in principle the next <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of our chunk of the universe is drawn from among raised to the to the st power neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">microstates</ENAMEX>.
Now let‚Äôs define the real adjacent possible. Each point in our current microstate in its classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> phase <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> lies on a specific trajectory that eventually either stays in the current microstate or leaves the current microstate to flow to one particular adjacent microstate. Consider all the points in the current microstate, and for each, draw a red arrow to the neighboring microstate into which that point flows. Then the real adjacent possible is the collection of all neighboring microstates reached by all the red arrows leaving our current microstate.
This is a perfectly fine definition in classical physics. The real adjacent possible from the current microstate might be a single adjacent microstate into which all arrows flow. That would mean that all the points in the current microstate lie on trajectories flowing to the same adjacent microstate.
Or the real adjacent possible might be the case that arrows flow from the current microstate to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adjacent microstates. That would mean that the points in the current microstate can be partitioned into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes, perhaps lying in distinct regions of the current microstate. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> of points flows to one of the adjacent microstates; the other class flows along trajectories to the other adjacent microstate. But the implication of the existence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> classes of points in our microstate is that its symmetry is broken¬<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">†¬†the</ENAMEX> space is broken into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions, each of which may be compact or be intermixed and intertwined volumes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> volume flows to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> adjacent possible microstate; the other flows to the other adjacent microstate.
More generally, we can define the dimensionality of the real adjacent possible with respect to any microstate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> system as the number of adjacent microstates into which flow occurs from somewhere within the current microstate. The dimensionality of the adjacent possible from a given microstate might be as low as or as large as the mathematical number of adjacent microstates, raised to the raised to the st power.
Clearly, the larger the dimension of the adjacent possible, the more symmetries have been broken within the current microstate, for it is broken into at least as many volumes internally as the dimensionality of the adjacent possible from that microstate. Of course, in the case of a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deterministic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> phase space, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> system flows from its current microstate to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of the real adjacent possible microstates.
It is interesting to remark that at some point if the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of a microstate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> system increases enough, the volume within a microstate corresponding to flow to a specific adjacent possible microstate will become small enough that it must run up against <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Heisenberg‚Äôs ‚</ENAMEX>Äúuncertainty principle.‚Äù Then at the quantum level the current microstate can have an amplitude to flow to many of the adjacent possible microstates. Which way the current microstate flows is then no longer deterministic, but a matter of throws of the quantum dice.
Historical Expansion into the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Adjacent Possible and Hints of a Law</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Let‚Äôs</ENAMEX> now ask whether we think that the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earth‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biosphere has increased or decreased in the past . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>. Consider as a start a liter of living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and a liter of their dead, homogenized molecular components. In the living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX>, small fluctuations in chemical concentrations within cells are turning myriad genes on and o in the complex system of genetic regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> known to exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
An example of a small section of the genetic network is the lactose operon in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. The lactose operon contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nearby small sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpromoter‚Äù</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúoperator</ENAMEX>.‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and operator act to regulate the transcription of the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Normally, a repressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesized</ENAMEX> from a distant gene binds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>, blocking transcription of the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. In the presence of lactose, however, the lactose binds to the repressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and changes its configuration such that the repressor leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>, freeing it. In that condition, other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> bound at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> are able to transcribe the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of the lactose operon. Included among these is the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Beta-galactosidase metabolizes lactose. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> normally does not make the beta-galactosidase enzyme, yet in the presence of the metabolite for which that enzyme is required, the lactose operon works to turn on synthesis of the very enzyme that metabolizes lactose. But the fact that small changes in the internal lactose concentration within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> turn on synthesis of the lactose operon, including the beta-galactosidase that metabolizes lactose, is precisely the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúthreshold event‚Äù¬†¬†the operon</ENAMEX> switches on or does not switch on¬†¬†that constitutes the breaking of symmetries in the current microstate of the liter of living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathematically</ENAMEX>, the thresholds become ‚Äúseparatrices‚Äù in the chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX> spaces of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of which the lactose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operon</ENAMEX> turns on and on the other side of which it does not.
In fact, the lactose operon system is a bistable switch. Once the operon is switched on, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is a permease that enhances transport of lactose into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Thus, once the operon is activated, it will remain active, even if the concentration of lactose outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is lowered from an initial high level required to activate the operon to some intermediate concentration. At that intermediate external concentration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> can be stably in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, lactose operon active or lactose operon inactive. Then small fluctuations of internal lactose concentration that cross the internal threshold separatrix concentration can cause the cell to jump from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of activity and remain in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> for a relatively long time.
For the liter of living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the number of adjacent possible microstates is on the order of at least the number of dierent on-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">o</ENAMEX> combinations of activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and metabolic products of which all the genetic regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of all the cells are capable. It seems obvious that the number of real adjacent possible microstates, hence the dimensionality of the adjacent possible from the current microstate of the liter of living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, is very much larger than the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the liter of dead and homogenized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> at the same temperature.
This simple observation suggests that in the past . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX> since life arose and autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> began coconstructing a biosphere linking exergonic and endergonic reactions into a diversifying web of ways of making a living, as the molecular diversity, species diversity, and behavioral diversity has increased, the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the biosphere as a whole, and most typical chunks of it, has increased dramatically.
With respect to my comment above about the broken symmetries eventually hitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heisenberg</ENAMEX> uncertainty limit on the volumes in each microstate, it is probably of more than passing interest that real living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, cells, do straddle the classical and quantum boundary. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> photon hitting a visual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment molecule</ENAMEX> can beget a neural response. In short, real living systems straddle the quantum classical boundary. If there is a tendency of coevolving autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to increase the diversity of alternative events that can occur, then living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> must eventually hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heisenberg</ENAMEX> uncertainty limit and abide at least partially in the quantum realm.
Indeed, the hypothesis that living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> must eventually abut and even transgress the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heisenberg</ENAMEX> uncertainty limit and abide partially in the quantum realm leads to an intriguing hypothesis. In chapter we will consider ‚Äúquantum decoherence.‚Äù This is a quite well-established phenomenon in which the quantum amplitudes propagating along dierent possible pathways between the same initial and final <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> can lose phase information. This loss of phase information then prevents the constructive and destructive interference that is the hallmark of quantum phenomena. The loss of the capacity for interference would mark the transition to classical behavior. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> now think that such decoherence constitutes a modern interpretation of the famous ‚Äúcollapse of the wave function‚Äù during a measurement event, as posited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copenhagen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. The collapse of the wave function converts the propagating superposition of quantum possibilities into an actual, classical event.
The persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermingling</ENAMEX> of quantum and classical phenomena in a living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> might require quantum coherence, but that coherence is widely doubted at the normal temperatures of cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermingling</ENAMEX> of quantum and classical phenomena might well occur and not require quantum coherence if the timescale of decoherence is close to or overlaps the timescales of cellular-molecular phenomena. Recent calculations suggest that the timescale of decoherence of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at room temperature might be on the order of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>. Thus, it is interesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and other organic molecules have modes of motion on timescales over many orders of magnitude, spanning from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> down to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or less. Thus, the timescale of decoherence is almost the same as the rapid molecular motions in cells. It does not seem totally implausible that cells persistently abide in both the quantum and classical realms, in which the persistently propagating superposition of amplitudes for alternative molecular motions decohere on very rapid timescales and thereby help choose the now classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microstates</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and their motions as those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> couple their coordinated dance with one another to carry out the alternative behaviors that guide a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in its next set of actions, its adjacent possible. In short, cells may feel their way into the adjacent possible by quantum superpositions of many simultaneous quantum possibilities, which decohere to generate specific classical choices. Such a hypothesis should be testable.
More, at the high risk of saying something that might be related to the subject of consciousness, the persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decoherence</ENAMEX> of persistently propagating superpositions of quantum possibility amplitudes such that the decoherent alternative becomes actualized as the now classical choice does have at least the feel of mind acting on matter. Perhaps cells ‚Äúprehend‚Äù their adjacent possible quantum mechanically, decohere, and act classically. Perhaps there is an internal perspective from which cells know their world.
Having now defined the dimensionality of the adjacent possible and noted that the biosphere and universe as a whole is vastly nonergodic, hence, kinetically trapped in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of its total space of possibilities, it is fair to wonder whether general laws may govern this nonergodic flow. Given that the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the biosphere has expanded in the past . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>, I want to make the obvious conjecture at a law: Our biosphere and any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">biosphere</ENAMEX> expands the dimensionality of its adjacent possible, on average, as rapidly as it can.
I will return just below to think about bounds on this expansion. For, as we will see, it seems reasonable that if the expansion were too rapid, the system would destroy the propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> whose coevolution and increasing diversity is what drives expansion into the adjacent possible and tends secularly to increase that dimensionality. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Autonomous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> persistently stumble onto new ways of making a living with one another and exploit those new ways. The biosphere‚Äôs advance into the adjacent possible is just exaptation over and over again.
In fact, it seems reasonable to think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúworkspace‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the biosphere, that is, what can happen next, as its actual plus its real adjacent possible. It seems likely, and I do conjecture, that the biosphere is expanding its workspace, on average, as fast as it can do so without destroying itself in the process.
And brazen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> that I am, I begin to wonder whether the universe as a whole in its nonergodic flow might be expanding the dimensionality of its total workspace including its adjacent possible as a secular trend. If so, then since the big bang, the universe persistently diversifies and becomes more complex in such a way that the diversity of dierent possible next events keeps increasing as rapidly, on average, as is possible. The greater the current diversity of matter, processes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of energy, the more ways there are for these to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to generate yet further novelty, further symmetry breakings. For this to be correct, time would have to have a directionality toward persistently broken symmetries. And an arrow of time would lie in this directionality. In chapter I return to these issues. There may be grounds to understand why the universe is so complex. In a generalization of our image of a self-constructing biosphere, the universe may construct itself to be as complex and diverse as possible.
If one could ever show such a law, a law in which the diversity and complexity of the universe naturally increases in some optimal manner, that would be impressive. Some <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics? An arrow of time? In short, one intriguing hypothesis about the arrow of time is that the nonergodic universe as a whole constructs itself persistently into an expanding adjacent possible, persistently expanding its workspace. This is in sharp contrast to the familiar idea that the persistent increase in entropy of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics is the cause of the arrow of time. But the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> law only makes sense for systems and timescales for which the ergodic hypothesis holds. The ergodic hypothesis does not seem to hold for the present universe and its rough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">timescale</ENAMEX>, at levels of complexity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> and above. Perhaps we are missing something big, right in front of us.
The nonergodicity of the universe as a whole and the biosphere in particular is interesting from another point of view. History enters when the space of the possible that might have been explored is larger, or vastly larger, than what has actually occurred. Precisely because the actual of the biosphere is so tiny compared to what might have occurred in the past . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX> and because autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> can evolve by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">heritable</TIMEX> variations that induce propagating frozen accidents in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant lineages</ENAMEX>, the biosphere is profoundly contingent upon history.
Bounds on the Growth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Biosphere‚Äôs Adjacent Possible</ENAMEX>
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> point to discuss about critical limits to the growth of the dimensionality of the adjacent possible is that major extinction events have occurred. Presumably the molecular diversity and certainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and behavioral diversity of the biosphere were devastated during such events. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of thoughts on these extinctions: the catastrophists and the endogenists. The catastrophists point to meteors, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> that hit o the coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucatan</ENAMEX> at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaur</ENAMEX> era, presumably, but not certainly, causing their extinction. The endogenists, including me, admit some big rocks plummeted but note the power law distribution in the size of extinction events, with many small ones and few large ones, and see in these signs self-organized criticality <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, discussed in the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, in which many small and few large extinction events arise from the endogenous coevolutionary behavior of ecosystems.
Particularly if we who favor endogenous dynamics are correct, I am precluded from arguing that biospheres endogenously always increase their adjacent possible. For <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I</ENAMEX>, among others, predict endogenous biosphere shenanigans among coevolving autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> as the causes of small and giant extinction events. If there is any trend to increase the adjacent possible, it can only be a secular trend. More, any such expansion must ultimately be limited on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> cannot have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> per species disporting themselves on, in, and around this globe. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> does occupy a hunk of three-dimensional space and the planet is only so big.
But I am more concerned with a probable endogenous self-regulation of any advance into the adjacent possible. If that advance into the adjacent possible were to take place too rapidly, it would tend to destroy the organismic propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that is the expansion‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> and persistent wellspring.
Recall the concept of a supracritical chemical reaction system. Such systems persistently generate molecular novelty. As we saw in discussing the origin-of-life problem, at a critical diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> and potential catalysts, a phase transition occurs in which the catalyzed reactions form a giant connected component. Molecular species flow from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> set actual into a persistently expanding adjacent possible.
I am fond of telling the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Noah‚Äôs Vessel</ENAMEX> experiment, hypothetical though it is. I ask, thereby, whether the biosphere is supracritical. Take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred million</NUMEX> of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female, normalizing a bit for mass (so you have small bits of hippos and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> per fly). Dump them all into a large blender and homogenize the hell out of them, breaking all tissue and cell boundaries, spilling out the stu of life into a common, homogenized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>.
The small molecule diversity in the blender is presumably on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and polymer diversity is on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of trillions</NUMEX>, thus . Assuming that any pair of molecular species can undergo <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one two</NUMEX> substrate‚Äìtwo product reaction, the total number of reactions is, as noted above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the molecular diversity, so is about . If the probability that any one protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> catalyzes any one reaction is, say, one in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX>, or , then the expected number of catalyzed reactions is just the product of the number of reactions times the number of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein catalysts</ENAMEX>, divided by the probability that a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> catalyzes a given reaction. This yields reactions times proteins divided by , which equals . In short, virtually all possible reactions will be catalyzed by something. Indeed, on average, each possible reaction will find dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein catalysts</ENAMEX>. A vast sustained explosion into the adjacent possible would occur. Ergo, the biosphere is supracritical. More precisely, the biosphere would be supracritical if all molecular species could be in eective contact with one another on short timescales. But all molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> do not come in contact with one another willy-nilly, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> are packaged into cells.
It is critical to note that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are not supracritical. The crude argument says that a cell‚Äôs metabolism has about organic molecules. Consider squirting a novel molecule, Q, into a cell. Presumably Q can be one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> substrates with each of these organic molecules. Thus, addition of Q to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> aords about novel reactions. Let the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> diversity of the cell be bounded by the human number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,.</ENAMEX> Any such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has evolved for some tasks, but may contain molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nooks</ENAMEX> and crannies that can serve as novel catalytic sites. The expected number of novel catalyzed reactions due to the presence of Q is given by the product of the number of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> catalysts times the number of novel reactions made available by injection of Q into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, divided by the probability that any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> catalyzes any given reaction. The product of potential catalysts (the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) and the reactions is ,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">,</ENAMEX>, or . The best current guess at the probability that a randomly chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> catalyzes a randomly chosen reaction comes from the probability that a monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> canalyzes a reaction and, as discussed above, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX>. If so, the expected number of the novel reactions that will be catalyzed when Q is squirted into a cell is ,, divided by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">,,,</ENAMEX>, or .. Since . is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than</NUMEX> , on average, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of novel reactions are catalyzed and cells are subcritical.
If the probability of catalysis is one only in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX> (as used in the calculation to see if the biosphere as a whole is supracritical), rather than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX>, then cells are even more deeply subcritical. With catalysis only one in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX>, the expected number of catalyzed reactions in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> upon addition of Q is ..
So cells are subcritical. It is a very good thing indeed that cells are subcritical. If cells were supracritical, they would forever generate molecular diversity internal to themselves. Many of the novel molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> would poison the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. In short, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> must remain subcritical and cells in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> must remain subcritical, or else the rate of generation of molecular diversity would overwhelm the capacity of natural selection to winnow out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">losers</ENAMEX>. Everything would die. All propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in the biosphere would rip itself apart in a torrential, if brief, burst of molecular creativity.
In short, the adjacent possible would explode rapidly, but everything around would bite the dust. If cells were supracritical, propagating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> would poison its own propagation.
The fact that cells almost certainly are not supracritical and that the biosphere as a homogenized whole, via the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Noah‚Äôs Vessel</ENAMEX> experiment, clearly is supracritical, means that the fact that each cell is somewhat isolated from the other and that each has bounded molecular diversity is not an accident. Were it not so, we would not be here.
But what of a microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>? Consider such a community with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> species. As the diversity of species increases, the total molecular diversity of the community increases. At some point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as a whole might become chemically supracritical. A novel molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, Q, introduced into one species would be sequestered, leave the cell unchanged and be taken up by other cells or lost in the soil, or undergo a reaction to form a known or a novel species. At some diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">species¬†¬†N</ENAMEX> and some rich onslaught of novel molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, Q, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> ,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">¬†¬†¬†¬†¬</ENAMEX>†the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> will become supracritical. At that stage, molecular diversity in the community increases rapidly. If concentrations of novel molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are high enough, say nanomolar or picomolar, then some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">N species</ENAMEX> will be poisoned. The species diversity of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> will fall. Presumably, this process can suce such that the diversity of a causally connected local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> falls suciently low that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is not supracritical.
The inverse argument allows the diversity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to increase by immigration or mutation of current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. This suggests a possible tendency of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> to move toward the subcritical-supracritical boundary.
In short, an endogenous process almost certainly limits the rate of generation of molecular diversity such that cells and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> are not supracritical. The rate of generation of molecular novelty must be suciently slow that natural selection can work on heritable variants to pick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX>. The point I am making is that it seems reasonable that endogenous processes in local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> gate the rate of exploration of the molecular adjacent possible, keeping it slow enough that natural selection can persistently pick current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">losers</ENAMEX>. If so, the biosphere gates its own rate of entry into the molecular adjacent possible. On these arguments, the biosphere may advance into the adjacent possible as fast as it can get away with doing so.
Indeed, it is helpful to frame the current discussion as a generalization of a famous phase transition discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manfred Eigen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter Schuster</ENAMEX> called the ‚Äúerror catastrophe.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Eigen and Schuster</ENAMEX> were considering a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of replicators, say viruses or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, evolving on a fitness landscape with many peaks of high fitness, valleys of low fitness, and ridges. In general, if the mutation rate is low enough, a population located at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point on the landscape will have a few mutants, one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which are fitter. These will replicate faster than the less fit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX>, eventually replacing them, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as a whole will move to the new point of higher fitness on the landscape. If the process is continued, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will climb steadfastly uphill to a local fitness peak and remain in its vicinity.
But if the mutation rate is then gradually increased, at some point the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> ‚Äúmelts‚Äù o the fitness peak and wanders away across the fitness landscape. This melting is the error catastrophe phase transition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eigen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schuster</ENAMEX> elegantly relate the known mutation rates of viruses to the sizes of their genomes and show that viruses are close to but below the error threshold where selection can still overcome the melting. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>, which are metabolically far more complex that viruses, are even more conservative than viruses; their mutation rate is well below the error catastrophe. It is not known why <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and higher cells have a mutation rate so far below the error catastrophe. Perhaps were the mutation rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> higher their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> would become supracritical. And that would be lethal.
Thus, the bounding of mutation rates and community diversity suggests that cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> avoid being supracritical, which in turn bounds and gates the entry into the adjacent possible by any local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, the biosphere as a whole is comprised of many dierent local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. The rate of exploration of the adjacent possible globally must be bounded such that a generalized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eigen-Schuster</ENAMEX> error catastrophe, melting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> away from adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to survive and propagate, does not occur.
All of this suggests the hypothesis that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">biosphere</ENAMEX> expands into the adjacent possible, as a secular trend, about as fast as it can get away with such exploration, subject to the requirement that selection must on average be strong enough and fast enough to slightly more than oset the rate of exploration of novelty.
It is interesting that the same feature may occur in the economy as a whole. We hear of future shock. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX>, what we fear is that the rate of technological change will overwhelm us. But will it? Or is there a self-regulating mechanism that gates our rate of entry into the technological adjacent possible?
The latter, I think. Consider this: Why does an innovation get itself introduced? Because someone thinks he or she can make money introducing that innovation. But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> making the innovation and introducing it to the global or village markets faced a product life cycle that was so very rapid that neither they nor others in the economy could absorb the innovations and make livings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> in question would go broke. We will only broach the technological adjacent possible at that rate at which we can make a living doing so. We gate our entry into the technological future.
Thus, it appears that the biosphere and the econosphere have endogenous mechanisms that gate the exploration of the adjacent possible such that, on average, such explorations do successfully find new ways of making a living, new natural and business games, at a rate that can be selected by natural selection, or its economic analogue of success or failure, at a rate that is sustainable. It is a further plausible hypothesis that the rate of exploration of the adjacent possible endogenously converges to the rate that is maximally sustainable.
I close this chapter with a surprising calculation and conjecture by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Morowitz</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biophysicist</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Mason University</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morowitz</ENAMEX> considers the atoms that form organic molecules, C, H, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>, nitrogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphorus</ENAMEX>, and sulphur. He then considers molecules of these elements and the kinds of bonds that can form between the elements. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of bonds, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-terminating bonds, like a terminal hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, -OH, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extending bonds, like C=<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Chain</ENAMEX>-extending bonds will tend to make a molecular system with many kinds of molecules even more diverse. Chain-terminating bonds will tend to limit the diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> that can form.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morowitz</ENAMEX> then considers the equilibrium ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extending bonds to all bonds, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extending plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-terminating, that would occur as a function of temperature, or equivalently, the energy per unit volume of the system. At very high temperatures, the system is a plasma, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-terminating bonds are vastly more predominant at equilibrium than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extending bonds. At very low temperatures, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-terminating bonds predominate overwhelmingly.
If one plots the equilibrium ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extending bonds to all bonds as a function of temperature, or energy per unit volume, the curve goes up, reaches <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single</NUMEX> peak, then trends downward. Thus, there is an optimal temperature, or energy per unit volume, where the equilibrium ratio of bonds maximizes the ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extending chemical bonds to all bonds. Morowitz‚Äôs remarkable conclusion is that the maximum of this curve, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extending bonds are as abundant as possible at equilibrium, corresponds quite closely to the average energy per unit volume of the biosphere of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>!
Even if the calculation is crude, I find this result deeply interesting. It suggests that, somehow, the biosphere has achieved an energy per unit volume such that at equilibrium <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>-extending bonds are maximized. But this means that the energy requirements to form a biosphere of high molecular diversity are minimized!
It is as if the biosphere has managed to get itself to an energy per unit volume that permits the maximum expansion of molecular diversity and, thus, the maximum expansion of the workspace of the biosphere. How might that happen? We can consider the plausible versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaia</ENAMEX> hypothesis in which a simple model planet has black or white daisies. The relative abundances of these tunes the albedo, or reflective power, of the planet, hence, the fraction of solar energy absorbed by the biosphere. Simple models show that the ratio of black and white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daisies</ENAMEX> can evolve to maximize their joint fitness, thereby tuning the energy per unit volume of the biosphere.
Morowitz‚Äôs calculation should be taken cautiously. My conclusions based on his almost back-of-the-envelope calculation should be taken even more cautiously. The arguments are cogent but unestablished. On the other hand, the biosphere has exploded in molecular diversity, the workspace of the biosphere has expanded, the adjacent possible of the biosphere has expanded. It is certainly interesting if the energy per unit volume of the biosphere is roughly that which makes this expansion as energetically inexpensive as possible for the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> coevolving with one another, exapting to new forms of making a living playing natural games, as we coconstruct our biosphere.
In summary, I hold out the very interesting conjecture that the biosphere as a whole evolves as a secular trend to expand its workspace, including the dimensionality of the adjacent possible as fast as is sustainably possible. If so, we have broached a tentative law for any biosphere. In the next chapter I discuss three further candidate laws. Treat all of them with great caution. It is enough if at this stage we can even begin to formulate tentative laws for all biospheres. A general biology is hardly begun, let alone explored.
