<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candidate Laws</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coconstruction</ENAMEX> of a Biosphere
or the purpose of our discussion here, grant that molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> propagate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and evolve by the roughly familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> aegis of mutation and selection. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">agents¬†¬†coevolving</ENAMEX> with one another, discovering displacements from equilibrium that can be used to accomplish work, making records of such sources of energy, then linking those exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions¬†¬†are the means by which our biosphere has come into being, actually coconstructed by the activities, accidents, striving, and failures of these autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, exapting persistently into their adjacent possible.
Yes. But how does a biosphere get itself constructed? Are there laws? Are there laws that might hold for any biosphere? Laws of a general biology, wherever autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> swirl into existence and change forever the begetting of the universe?
No one knows. Yet is seems reasonable to expect such laws and honorable to begin, even now, to seek them. At worst we will be wrong. Rather more stunningly, we may be right. It is surely enough if at this early state we can even begin to formulate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> general laws. Our eorts will only improve over time.
In the present chapter, I consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> general laws for any biosphere. Because the science is more advanced than some of the material in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX>, I will be able to describe it in somewhat more detail. That which is more worked out is, I hope, a signature of how the glimmered science of the past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> may develop.
Coevolutionarily constructible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> may evolve to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> apparently dierent phase transitions:
Law .<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Communities</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> will evolve to the dynamical ‚Äúedge of chaos‚Äù within and between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, thereby simultaneously achieving an optimal coarse graining of each agent‚Äôs world that maximizes the capacity of each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> to discriminate and act without trembling hands.
Law .A coassembling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, on a short timescale with respect to coevolution, will assemble to a self-organized critical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with some maximum number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. In the vicinity of that maximum, a power law distribution of avalanches of local extinction events will occur. As the maximum is approached the net rate of entry of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species slows</ENAMEX>, then halts.
Law .On a coevolutionary timescale, coevolving autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> as a community attain a self-organized critical state by tuning landscape structure (ways of making a living) and coupling between landscapes, yielding a global power law distribution of extinction and speciation events and a power law distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species lifetimes</ENAMEX>.
Law .<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Autonomous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> will evolve such that causally local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> are on a generalized ‚Äúsubcritical-supracritical boundary‚Äù exhibiting a generalized self-organized critical average for the sustained expansion of the adjacent possible of the eective phase space of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Candidate Law 1: The Dynamical Edge</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaos</ENAMEX>
Molecular autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, are parallel-processing molecular dynamical systems. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> has on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three thousand</NUMEX> structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">molecular species</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> includes perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> small molecules in metabolism, the genes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and protein <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, lipids, large carbohydrates, and so forth. For the sake of argument, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">let‚Äôs</ENAMEX> say there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five thousand</NUMEX> molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the number is larger.
A cell is a parallel-processing dynamical system. That is to say, the cell carries out a wide variety of molecular activities, including the turning on and o of transcription of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>; the processing of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> into mature messenger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>; the translation of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the activities of many of those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as enzymes to catalyze reaction, the modification of the activities of enzymes by chemical events such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of structural components such as bilipid membrane, and microtubule <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and disassembly; and the construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are located transmembrane at the cell boundary and elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, including on nuclear membranes of eukaryotes, such that signal molecules can be detected and responded to.
So, lots of activities are going on all the time, in parallel, in your typical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, or your own pancreatic cells. The proper conceptual framework to think about all this activity is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äústate space‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the system. If we ignore geometry, that is, the locations of molecules relative to one another in the cell¬†¬†which is a big idealization¬†¬†then the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> consists of a list of all the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúactivities‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúconcentrations.‚Äù
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX>, I will focus on the behavior of the genetic regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. It has been known since the seminal work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monod</ENAMEX> in and , work for which they won the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX>, that genes can turn one another on and o. In more detail, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> made by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> can diuse in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and bind to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> site, called a ‚Äúcis acting site,‚Äù near a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> gene. Genes that encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are the structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>; the binding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, or several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at a set of nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cis sites</ENAMEX>, can turn the second structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> on or o. More generally, the binding of diusible factors, called ‚Äútrans acting factors,‚Äù to cis sites, can tune graded rates of transcription of the nearby structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>.
The human cell is estimated to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eighty</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX> structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between ten thousand</NUMEX> to perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX> cis acting sites. In general, any structural gene may be regulated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> dierent trans acting factors that may bind at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or more</NUMEX> nearby cis acting sites. Therefore, the human genomic system is a highly complex web of regulatory connections and interactions by which the activities of genes turn one another on and o, or more generally tune <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> another‚Äôs activity.
It is the joint dynamical behavior of such genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, plus the remaining cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and other molecular interactions, that controls cell behavior, including development from the fertilized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> to the adult.
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three decades</TIMEX>, considerable theoretical insight has been achieved with respect to the expected behaviors of such large genetic regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. I discuss the relations to experimental evidence briefly below.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean Networks</ENAMEX>
To take a very simple case, we consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes of a cell and idealize further to imagine that at any moment in time a gene is either actively transcribing into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, with active = , or it is not transcribing, so is inactive, hence . Thus, the genes are treated as binary, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúBoolean,‚Äù variables. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is a model genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> binary, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boolean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, each receiving regulatory inputs from some among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and each governed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function on its inputs telling the activities of its inputs for which it should turn on or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">o.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> idealization is severe, but it is a very useful place to start. If the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> has , structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and each can be on or o, then the number of possible patterns, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äústates,‚Äù of gene activity in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is a staggering , or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about ,</NUMEX>. That is, a human cell could, in principle, be in any one of a , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of gene activity. Its state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> is ,. There has only been <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> since the big bang. If it took merely a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> to turn a gene on or o, then no human cell could have explored more than an infinitesimally tiny fraction of its state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">,</ENAMEX>, even if it had been chugging along since the big bang.
That cannot be what cells do. Something must confine their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúflow‚Äù</ENAMEX> in their state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. And, indeed, what confines their flow is precisely the genetic regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> by which genes turn one another on and o.
Very good work shows that such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> can exist in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> broad regimes: an ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, a chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, and near a phase transition between order and chaos. All the evidence suggests that cells have evolved to lie in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, fairly near the edge of chaos. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Communities</ENAMEX> of cells may lie even closer to the edge of chaos. The hypothesis that cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> lie in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> near the phase transition to chaos is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> law .
To understand this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> law, I need to describe to you the structure and behaviors of model genetic networks. Thereby we can characterize the ordered, chaotic, and edge-of-chaos regimes.
To take a very simple case, we consider a cell with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, A, B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> In this simplest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boolean</ENAMEX> idealization, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, each of which can be on or o, hence, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> raised to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of gene activities: (), (), (), (), (), (), (), (), where the ordering of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> symbols stands for the activity <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, respectively.
The most general description of a dynamical system consists in specifying its state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>, then identifying for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> which state or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> it changes into. For a deterministic dynamical system, each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> changes into a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor state</ENAMEX>. For a nondeterministic system, single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> can change to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor states</ENAMEX>. Which of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor states</ENAMEX> is chosen in the nondeterministic system is given by some random process such as flipping a coin.
Figure .a shows an arbitrary deterministic state space among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, A, B, C. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, I have chosen its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor state</ENAMEX> at random.
Figure .a shows several characteristic features of these very simple Boolean dynamical systems. First, note that the system is parallel processing. More than a single gene changes its activity value from to or to on many of the state transitions. Next, there is a finite number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>. Over time, if the system is released from any initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, it will follow a trajectory of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> through state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. Since there is a finite number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, eventually the trajectory must hit a state previously encountered on the trajectory. But the system is deterministic, thus once the trajectory reenters a state previously encountered, it will follow a recurrent loop of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>, called a ‚Äústate cycle.‚Äù
In general, the length of a state cycle can be a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that reenters itself, a ‚Äústeady <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,‚Äù or all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> may lie on a single, long cycle that traverses all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> or state cycles may be any length between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> limits.
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> typical property of such a parallel-processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> system is that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> state cycle may exist. In the present example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> exist in the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>.
State cycles are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúattractors‚Äù</ENAMEX> because they typically attract the flow of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> into themselves. This is shown in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> state cycle, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> () and () flow into the state cycle, but are not on it. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äútransients</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Transient</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are encountered on trajectories flowing to state cycle attractors, but are not encountered again once the attractor is reached, assuming no perturbations occur to the system.
The set of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> flowing into a state cycle attractor plus that state cycle is called the ‚Äúbasin of attraction‚Äù of the attractor.
The set of attractors are jointly the asymptotic long-term alternative behaviors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. If released from any initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, the system ultimately winds up cycling on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its attractors.
Thus in discrete-valued deterministic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">networks¬†¬†here</ENAMEX>, binary ones¬†¬†each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> lies in a single basin of attraction, so the basins of attraction partition the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> into disjoint sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
The simple example of Figure .b allows us to show another feature of such synchronous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boolean networks¬†¬†here</ENAMEX>, synchronous means that all the binary variables change value at the same clocked moment. Since each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor state</ENAMEX>, we can write a table of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and for each, its unique <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>.
Figure .b shows the state transitions for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time T</ENAMEX>, to the state it transforms to one clocked moment later, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time T</ENAMEX> + .
But Figure .b also shows for each gene, in order (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Boolean</ENAMEX> rule, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, A, B, C, that turns each on and o as a function of the values of itself and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
As it happens, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> A and B have Boolean functions that depend on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, A, B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. By</ENAMEX> examination, however, gene C has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function that depends only on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>, not on gene B. To say that the activity of gene C depends only on A and C and not B means that once the combinations of activities of A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> are defined at a moment T, the next activity of C at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> + is indepen-dent of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B</ENAMEX> is on or o at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> T. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function is C = (not A or not C); that is, gene C will turn on at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next moment</TIMEX> if at the current moment either A is not active or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> is not active or both are not active.
From Figure .c, after simplifying Boolean expressions as we just did for gene C, we can write down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwiring diagram‚Äù</ENAMEX> of inputs among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Since A and B depend upon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, each receives a regulatory input from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Gene C, however, receives inputs only from itself and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> A.
The combination of Figures .d and .c, respectively, shows for each gene the inputs to that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and the logical or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function by which it turns on and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o. Thus</ENAMEX>, the combination of .c and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX> is the genetic network among the genes.
Order, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaos</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edge of Chaos</ENAMEX>
As noted above, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> of work by many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">scientists¬†¬†initially</ENAMEX> on synchronous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> but now generalized to a wider <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of model genetic systems, including some where genes can exhibit continuously graded levels of activity as their inputs turn gradually up or down¬†¬†all show the same simple, general results: There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> broad regimes of behavior. A number of very simple properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, involving connectivity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and simple biases on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions, control which regime a network lies in.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ordered Regime</ENAMEX>
Figure . shows a hypothetical movie of a network in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Let the network be released from an arbitrary initial state and flow along a trajectory toward a state cycle attractor. If a gene is rapidly turning on and o, or twinkling, call it green. If the gene is frozen in the active or frozen in the inactive value for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX>, say, fifty state transitions or more, call it red. In particular, once the system is on its state cycle, the twinkling genes that turn on and o on the state cycle would be green and those genes frozen on or frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">o</ENAMEX>, red.
Initially, just after release from some random initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, most genes are twinkling, hence green. As the network approaches its state cycle, more and more genes turn red, hence are frozen on or frozen o. By the time the system has reached its state cycle attractor, the majority of the genes are colored red (Figure .a).
Most critically, if one considers the subset of red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, they form a giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpercolating cluster‚Äù</ENAMEX> whose size scales linearly with the size of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. In eect, the frozen red component is a ‚Äúfrozen red sea,‚Äù which spans the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and typically leaves behind isolated twinkling green islands.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaotic Regime</ENAMEX>
In the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the same movie shows that the majority of the genes remain green, twinkling on and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> (Figure .c). So a vast, twinkling green sea spans the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, typically leaving behind isolated frozen red islands.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edge of Chaos</ENAMEX>
As parameters of the network discussed below are tuned from the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> toward the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the green percolating sea becomes smaller and eventually fragments into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or many isolated green islands. The point of fragmentation of the green sea into green islands constitutes a phase transition from the chaotic to the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. This phase transition is sometimes called the edge of chaos (Figure .b).
Several critical features distinguish the ordered from the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. In the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the lengths of state cycle attractors scales polynomially with the number of genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> near the phase transition to chaos there is evidence for universal scaling in which the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> on a state cycle scales as the square root of the number of genes. This scaling, which I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> discovered over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX>, still staggers me. If the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> has , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, it has a state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> of , or , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Yet if the human genomic system lies in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> near the phase transition to chaos, it will settle down and cycle among the square root of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">,</ENAMEX>, or about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>!
Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is very very small compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">,</ENAMEX>. The overwhelming order of the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, I believe, keeps cells from wandering all over their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> spaces for eternities beyond eternities. In fact, it takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> to turn a eukaryotic gene on or o, so it would take a cell from to , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, or from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> . <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours to about hours</TIMEX>, to traverse its state cycle attractor. This is right in the biological ballpark. For example, the cell division cycle of dierent human cell types is in the range of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">to hours</TIMEX>.
By contrast, in the chaotic regime <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> cycle lengths scale exponentially with the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. The deepest one can go into the chaotic regime is to assign at random the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor state</ENAMEX> for each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In that case, in general, each gene is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes. In this case, the typical state cycle length is the square root of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. For the human genome with , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, a typical state cycle length would be the square root, hence ,. Remember, it is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only seconds</TIMEX> since the big bang. State cycle attractors of lengths ,? Not in my body, thank you very much.
In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> articles I wrote on the subject of random Boolean nets, as long ago as and , I plotted cell cycle lengths from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> as diverse as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and simple and complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. These progressively more complex organisms have progressively more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> per cell and more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> per cell. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> net theory is on the right track, and if cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> are a reasonable proxy for expected state cycle times as a function of the number of genes, then cell cycle time should scale as a square root function of the number of genes. This prediction is actually pretty much correct. Indeed, a plot of median cell cycle time versus total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is a square root function from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>.
But there are caveats: The number of genes in cells may not be proportional to the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> per cell. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is ‚Äújunk.‚Äù A plausible estimate of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is now available for many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. On this basis, cell cycle time scales somewhere between a square root and a linear¬†¬†that is, directly proportional¬†¬†function of estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> per cell. So without yet invoking natural selection to tune the structure and logic, the theory of random Boolean nets is already quite close to the data.
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> critical feature that distinguishes the ordered from the chaotic regime is what happens when the activity of a single gene is transiently reversed. I would note that such transient reversals happen all the time in normal development. For example, a single hormone enters a cell, then the nucleus, then binds to a nuclear genetic site and transiently changes the activity of some gene. Typically, the results unleash a cascade of alterations of gene activities. These cascades of alterations guide development and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell dierentiation</ENAMEX>. In the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cascades</ENAMEX> tend to be smallish. In the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the cascades are typically huge. In real cells, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cascades</ENAMEX> tend to be smallish. More, we can actually predict their size distribution.
Let‚Äôs define a gene as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúdamaged‚Äù</ENAMEX> if after an initial gene has had its activity reversed for a single moment the gene in question ever behaves dierently than it would have had the perturbed gene been left undisturbed. In eect, damage shows that perturbation of a gene aects the behavior of the damaged gene. Imagine damaged genes purple. If a gene has misbehaved once, it is purple, whether it stops misbehaving or keeps misbehaving.
Given this definition of damage, we can consider in detail <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> identical copies of a network, in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, running at the same speed. Now pick a model gene at random. If it is on, flip it o. It is o, flip it on. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color</ENAMEX> it purple since you have damaged it.
Now watch the unperturbed and perturbed copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, and consider purple any gene that ever does something dierent in the perturbed network compared to the unperturbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. In general, you will see a purple avalanche spread out from the initially perturbed gene. The purple avalanche will spread out in some way, then must eventually stop. For example, at a maximum, all the genes turn purple. Thus, we can define the size of a given damage avalanche as the number of genes that turned purple, hence misbehaved at least once.
In the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, something magic happens. If one of the frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red genes</ENAMEX> is perturbed, typically no avalanche spreads from that purple gene. If an avalanche spreads at all, it is tiny.
By contrast, if a twinkling green gene in one of the isolated green islands is perturbed and turned purple, a purple avalanche spreads to some or all of the twinkling green genes in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. But the avalanche stops at the boundaries of the green <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> since damage avalanches cannot propagate through the frozen red percolating sea.
Because purple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avalanches</ENAMEX> cannot propagate through the frozen red percolating sea, the green islands are functionally isolated from one another. The consequence is that there is a characteristic size distribution of avalanches in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> and a very dierent distribution in the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
Figure .a schematizes the distribution of avalanches for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in the ordered regime very near the phase transition to chaos. The figure plots the logarithm of the size of the avalanche on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis and the logarithm of the number of instances of avalanches of each size on the y-axis. As you can see, the size distribution shows up as a straight line in this log log plot, sloping down to the right. Hence, the distribution is a power law distribution, with many small and few large avalanches of change propagating through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. In addition, there is a finite cuto and thus a largest-size avalanche, which seems to scale as a square root function of the total number of genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Deeper in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the size distribution of avalanches remains a power law, but the slope down to the right becomes steeper, so there are fewer big avalanches compared to small avalanches.
If a human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> near the phase transition to chaos and harbors some , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, then the largest avalanches should be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two</NUMEX> times the square root of the number of genes, hence x , or about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This is probably about right. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> fly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> melanogaster, with about , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the largest avalanches should be about twice the square root of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">,</ENAMEX>, or x , or . The largest avalanche I am aware of occurs when the moulting hormone ecdysone acts on the salivary glands and induces changes in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpus‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the polytene chromosomes. If each pu is a single gene, as most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geneticists</ENAMEX> think, then ecdysone unleashes an avalanche altering the activities of genes.
No comparative data yet show whether the size distribution of avalanches in real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> is a power law, nor whether the largest avalanches scale as a square root function of the number of genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. But these hypotheses are fully testable using today‚Äôs experimental techniques.
Nevertheless, these predictions do roughly fit one‚Äôs expectation as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> if perturbed should unleash no avalanches or just small avalanches, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> should unleash larger avalanches, and some modest fraction of the genes at most should be open to alteration by transient alteration in the activity of any single gene. Thus, this typical, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúgeneric,‚Äù behavior of parallel-processing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in the ordered regime closely fits the known data and our informed intuitions.
The chaotic regime contrasts starkly with the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Its expected behaviors are not biologically plausible. The chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> diers from the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> for a simple reason. In the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, the twinkling green sea percolates. If a single green gene is perturbed and turned purple, that perturbation usually unleashes a purple avalanche that spreads through much of the percolating green sea. Huge damage avalanches are unleashed by single gene perturbations.
These huge avalanches are exactly the signature of the famous ‚Äúbutterfly eect‚Äù seen in the weather, where a small initial change can have large-scale consequences. In short, the spreading purple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avalanches</ENAMEX> constitute ‚Äúsensitivity to initial conditions.‚Äù On the other hand, it is important to distinguish between low<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-dimensional</TIMEX> chaos, characterized by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> variables governed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> equations, and the high<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-dimensional</TIMEX> chaos, shown in large-model genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of gene variables. In high-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of genes modeled as binary variables, chaos shows up as the enormous avalanches of damage that spread from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to many of the variables of the model network.
Figure .b schematizes the size distribution of avalanches in the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Unlike the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, there is a spike of huge avalanches where to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> of the genes are damaged. In a cell, this would correspond to a hormone changing the activity of a single gene and , to , genes downstream changing their activities. This does not happen.
As in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, however, in the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> there is also a power law distribution of small avalanches, present in addition to the vast avalanches that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rocket</ENAMEX> through the green sea. Presumably, these small avalanches occur when green genes near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">filigreed ‚Äúcoasts‚Äù</ENAMEX> of red frozen islands are perturbed and the purple avalanche is trapped on the fingers of the red beaches.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> feature, a convergence versus divergence along flows in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> that characterizes the ordered versus chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, is perhaps the most important to our future discussions. In the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, initially nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> lie on trajectories that tend to converge in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. In the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, initially nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> tend to lie on trajectories that diverge in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. At the edge of chaos, initially nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> tend to lie on trajectories that neither converge nor diverge in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>.
These behaviors are conveniently shown in a recurrence map, which I call a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúDerrida curve‚Äù</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Derrida</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saclay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, first showed it to me. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Derrida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pomeau</ENAMEX> were also the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to find analytic proof of the ordered and chaotic regimes and the phase transition between them.
Consider <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> to each of those <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>:
state (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">) ‚Äô</ENAMEX> () <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> ‚Äô
state (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">) ‚Äô</ENAMEX> () <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> ‚Äô
We can define the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúHamming distance‚Äù</ENAMEX> between state and state , the number of binary variables by which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> dier. Here the Hamming distance is , since gene is in state and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> . In addition, we can define the normalized Hamming distance, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dt</ENAMEX>, between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> at time t as the fraction of binary variables by which they dier. Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/ = .. Similarly</ENAMEX>, we can define the normalized Hamming distance between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor states</ENAMEX> at time t + . In the case above, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(t + ) = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">/</ENAMEX> = ..
Then we can compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dt</ENAMEX> and D(t + ) and ask if the initial distance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time T</ENAMEX> decreased or increased at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time T</ENAMEX> + . In the current case, the initial distance increased from . to . at the next moment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> + . In short, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> initially nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, diering in the activity of a single gene, spread further apart <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one moment</TIMEX> later. Indeed, this spreading is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time step of the spreading of a purple avalanche of damage.
To characterize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with respect to the ordered and chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, it is convenient to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of random pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> at dierent initial distances, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dt</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX> can vary from . to .. For each pair of initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> forward <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one moment</TIMEX>, discover the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor states</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and compute <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(t + ) for that pair of initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Average the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(t + ) values for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of pairs of initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> at each initial distance, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dt</ENAMEX>. The typical results are shown in Figure ..
Figure . is a recurrence map, with Dt shown on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(t + ) shown on the y-axis. Thus, for an initial pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX> = ., if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor states</ENAMEX> have spread apart, say to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(t + ) = ., a dot in the xy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> at x = ., <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">y</ENAMEX> = . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> this event. The averaged set of these dots for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of pairs of initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> at all dierent initial distances is the average recurrence map for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Figure .</ENAMEX>, the main diagonal, running at a -degree angle from the lower-left corner, which corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX> = and D(t + ) = , shows the condition where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>(t + ) = <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX>. If a dot lies on the main diagonal, then the distance between the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> is the same as the distance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor states</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> initial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> lie on trajectories that neither diverge nor converge in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>.
In the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> lie on trajectories that diverge further apart in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>, so the recurrence map lies above the main diagonal for small initial distances. For large initial distances, even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> have the property that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> tend to lie on trajectories that converge. The degree to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> recurrence curve lies above the main diagonal for small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dt</ENAMEX> is a measure of how deeply into the chaotic regime the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> lies. Deep into the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, hence small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dt</ENAMEX>, diverge swiftly. Thus, the recurrence curve is well above the main diagonal for small values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX>.
By contrast, in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, as shown in Figure ., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> recurrence curve is below the main diagonal for small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dt</ENAMEX>, that is, initial states that are close lie on trajectories that converge. At the phase transition between order and chaos, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> recurrence curve begins, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX> = , tangent to the main diagonal, then falls below it as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX> increases.
In summary, in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> tend to lie on trajectories that converge in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. At the phase transition, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> tend to lie on trajectories that neither converge nor diverge. In the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> tend to diverge.
As I will shortly discuss below, it is plausible to think that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, evolve such that they lie in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> near the phase transition to chaos. A major reason for this intuition is that under such circumstances flow in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> is mildly convergent. In turn, this will allow the autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and reliable actions, hence, to play the most sophisticated natural games by which to earn their livings.
The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> features that characterize the phase transition between order and chaos seem by good numerical evidence to coincide. That is, when parameters discussed below are tuned from the chaotic to the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> such that the green sea is just breaking up into green islands, simultaneously, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> curve changes from the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> to become tangent with the main diagonal for small values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dt</ENAMEX>. And at just this point, state cycle lengths switch from scaling exponentially to scaling polynomially with the number of genes.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least three</NUMEX> simple parameters tune whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are in the ordered or chaotic regimes. Therefore it is important that evolution can readily tune whether genomic systems lie in the ordered or chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> by tuning any of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> parameters. Even more important, evolution seems to have done just that and tuned cells into the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Since cells are our only example of evolved autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, the data support my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> first law that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> will evolve to the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> near the phase transition to chaos.
The simplest parameter to tune is the number of inputs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, per gene. I showed numerically in , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pomeau</ENAMEX> showed analytically in , that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = or less, networks lie in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pomeau</ENAMEX> showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = is the edge of chaos phase transition. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> greater than , networks lie in the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
Already this is worth the excited attention I gave it so long ago. For the results show that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with randomly chosen logic nevertheless behaves with exquisite order. Say, a network of , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is constructed at random, with the simple limitation that each model gene have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs but that the wiring diagram be chosen at random, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function assigned to each gene among the possible Boolean functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs is also chosen, once and for all, at random, this spaghetti mess of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> with its tangle of , wires connecting the genes in some mad scramble will straighten itself out.
The system settles down to cycle among about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> out of , or ,! Order for free, I keep saying. Selection need not struggle against all odds to achieve cells that behave with overwhelming order. That order lies to hand for selection‚Äôs further craftings.
There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> further known parameters that can tune <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> from the chaotic to the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> is greater than . Both are biases on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, real cells show dramatic evidence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biases, which I call ‚Äúcanalyzing Boolean functions.‚Äù I discuss this canalyzing bias <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bias is characterized by a parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúP</ENAMEX>.‚Äù Consider in Figure .c, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> A. It has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> values and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> values. The parameter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> is defined as the number of instances of the majority value over the full set of cases. Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> for gene A = /. For gene B, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> values and one value. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> is /. For gene C there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> values and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> values. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> is /.
By definition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function can vary from . to ., when the majority fraction varies from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> to all the possible cases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> showed that, in general, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K > , P</ENAMEX> can be tuned upward from . to some critical value, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pc</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> pass from the chaotic to the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. The critical value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> as a function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> is shown in Figure .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">a. Universal</ENAMEX> scaling for cycle lengths as a square root function of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has been established along the phase transition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>.
The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> bias in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions are the canalyzing Boolean functions. Consider gene C in Figure .<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX> If gene A is , gene C will be at the next moment no matter what the activities of gene B or C may be. If gene A is , gene C may be or at the next moment, depending on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior</TIMEX> state of gene C itself.
Gene C is governed by a canalyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canalyzing Boolean</ENAMEX> functions have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> input with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> value that suces to guarantee the next <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the regulated gene, regardless of the values of all other inputs. By inspection, if A is now, then C is guaranteed to be a moment later. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function is canalyzing, and I call A a canalyzing input to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Note</ENAMEX> that gene C is also a canalyzing input to gene C.
Look next at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function for gene B in Figure .<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX> If gene A is , then gene B is sure to be the next moment, regardless of the activities of B and C. So A is a canalyzing input to B. But if B is , that too assures that B will be at the next moment. So B is a canalyzing input to itself. And similarly, if gene C is , gene B is sure to be the next moment. Gene B has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> canalyzing inputs. By contrast, gene A in Figure .c has no canalyzing input, so is not a canalyzing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function. No value of A alone, B alone, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> alone suces to guarantee the next activity of gene A.
In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> inputs may have ,<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">,,¬†¬†¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†K</ENAMEX> canalyzing inputs. Numerical evidence shows that, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K ></ENAMEX> inputs per gene, a sucient bias toward a high fraction of genes with a sucient number of canalyzing inputs drives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> from the chaotic into the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Figure .b shows the phase transition curve in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>.
Before turning back to biology, it is essential to stress that the results noted above for synchronous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> extend to asynchronous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> and, more critically, extend to a family of model gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in which the genes have graded levels of activity. This is important because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">on-o Boolean</ENAMEX> idealization is quite severe. Real genes show graded levels of activities as a function of the concentrations of their trans acting inputs and the bound <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of their cis regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loci</ENAMEX>. If our results were fragile in that they depended upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX>, on-o idealization, we could not trust them to inform us about real cells. Glass and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> have examined a model with continuously graded levels of gene activity, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äúpiecewise linear model</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and found the same qualitative behaviors. In particular, the same phase transition occurs as a function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K, P</ENAMEX>, and C. The striking dierence, however, is that deep in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> of the piecewise linear case, the genes of the twinkling green islands settle down to steady states that dier on dierent attractors. Near the phase transition to chaos, the green islands begin to exhibit sustained ‚Äúlimit cycle‚Äù oscillations that become chaotic in the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
Thus, there is now good general evidence that the ordered and chaotic regimes and the phase transition between them are deeply characteristic of some enormous class of parallel-processing nonlinear dynamical systems.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biology</ENAMEX>
But what of real cells? We have no conclusive evidence, yet an abundance of telling hints. If I am not yet entirely convinced and if I am¬†¬†as I am¬†¬†biased, I nevertheless become increasingly confident that cells, and probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of cells, do live in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> near the edge of chaos. Not only does the evidence point this way, but cells should live near the edge of chaos. Why? As remarked already, the intuition is simple. Being autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> must, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> living in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">communities</ENAMEX>, make the maximum number of reliable discriminations possible and act on them reliably, without ‚Äútrembling hands.‚Äù Just inside the edge of chaos seems the ideal place.
Intuitively, slightly convergent flow in state space allows classification, for when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> converge on a single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">successor state</ENAMEX>, those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have been classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúequivalent‚Äù</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. Slightly convergent flow would seem to allow the maximum number of reliable classifications in the face of a noisy environment. The convergent flow buers the system against the noise of the environment.
And what of trembling hands? No point making superb discriminations, seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stag deer</ENAMEX>, drawing your bow, aiming the arrow, then shooting yourself in the foot. Again, slightly convergent flow in state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> to buer external and internal noise seems ideal.
So what about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>? My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Harris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Sawhill</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Wuensche</ENAMEX>, and I have carried out work over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX> that has analyzed actual gene regulatory rules for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotic genes</ENAMEX> drawn from a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">eukaryotic organisms¬†¬†yeast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, and so forth. The results show a very strong statistical bias in favor of genes governed disproportionately by canalyzing Boolean functions. When we have constructed model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with the observed bias toward canalyzing functions, such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> lie modestly in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> curve and other criteria noted above.
It all began at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Institute</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Harris</ENAMEX>, a molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologist</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> was visiting. I told him about canalyzing functions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúNever,‚Äù</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>. Seeing my opportunity I replied, ‚ÄúYou have a good genetics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, want to read a bunch of papers and analyze the transcription rules of genes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four or five</NUMEX> known regulatory inputs?‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> would say yes, for the reading of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the subsequent years</TIMEX>, and cataloging the detailed results, was going to be a substantial task.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúSure</ENAMEX>,‚Äù he replied.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Some months later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> called. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúHey</ENAMEX>, the results for genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs look interesting! There is a bias toward canalyzing functions.‚Äù
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúNever</ENAMEX>,‚Äù I said.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll send the data,‚Äù was the reply.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> had carefully read about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> papers on regulated genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = known inputs, where the data was available at the level of actual binding of trans acting factors to cis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and the turning on of transcription. A gene with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = known inputs has, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> idealization, to the rd, or , possible on-o <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of those inputs, as we have seen. In virtually all the cases used, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> had good data for all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> input <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. He warranted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealization</ENAMEX> had its problems, but found that in many cases the response of a gene was nonlinear to its inputs. Thus, gene A might be turned on percent by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> by factor , but percent by both factors at the same concentration. It looks like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boolean ‚Äúand‚Äù</ENAMEX> function, where the regulated gene is ‚Äúon‚Äù at the next moment only if both inputs are <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúon‚Äù</ENAMEX> now.
We need some mathematical facts. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> inputs is to the to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , there are Boolean functions. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , there are Boolean functions. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , there are , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> function with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> inputs, as noted, can have , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">, ,¬†¬†¬†.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬†¬†¬† K canalyzing</ENAMEX> inputs. But, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> increases, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions that are canalyzing at all, on or more inputs, declines dramatically, as shown in Figure .. In particular, . percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs are canalyzing. But <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs are canalyzing. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">, Boolean</ENAMEX> functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs are canalyzing. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Only less than percent</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the billion</NUMEX> or so Boolean functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs are canalyzing.
This shift means that we can test if there is a bias in sampled eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Indeed, in more detail, among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K = Boolean</ENAMEX> functions, percent have no canalyzing inputs and a decreasing fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions have , , or canalyzing inputs, as you can see in Figure ..
Also plotted on Figure . is the observed fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotic genes</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs. The observed curve is the opposite from the curve expected if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> rules drawn at random from among the functions. Indeed, fully percent of the observed cases have canalyzing inputs, while the expected fraction would be only peercent if rules were drawn at random.
<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> does not need fancy statistics, but they readily confirm that the observed distribution is sharply shifted to large numbers of canalyzing inputs per gene. Figure . shows similar results for genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = known inputs. Again, the shift toward genes regulated with a high number of canalyzing inputs is apparent and strongly statistically significant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = genes shows the same bias, but the cases are too few to be statistically significant.
But there remains analysis to be done. Recall the P parameter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Networks</ENAMEX> with high P values, where genes are mostly turned on or turned o by their inputs, also lie in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Moreover, there is an overlap but nonidentity between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions of high P values and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions with or more canalyzing inputs. When we analyzed our samples of genes, they also had high P values compared to a random distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs.
In order to discriminate whether the observed bias was toward high canalyzing inputs or high P values or both, we carried out a ‚Äúresidual analysis.‚Äù That is, we classified all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K = Boolean</ENAMEX> functions into dierent P classes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P = /</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P = /</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P = /</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P = /</ENAMEX>. Within each P class, some Boolean functions have , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">,</ENAMEX> , or canalyzing inputs. Therefore, among all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = within a given P class, there is some distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions with , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">,</ENAMEX> , or canalyzing inputs. Thus, we asked, within a given P class, if the real genes showed a residual bias toward a high number of canalyzing inputs per gene compared to what would happen if real genes were governed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> rules drawn at random with respect to canalization. The answer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = genes is overwhelmingly yes.
In short, if we control for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> classes, there is a very strong and very statistically significant residual bias toward high numbers of canalyzing inputs per gene. Conversely, when we controlled for canalyzing input classes and tested for a residual bias toward high P values, there was no sign whatsoever of such a bias. Thus, it appears that evolution has, in fact, tuned the choices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> rules used to govern genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = known inputs, as well as genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs that we have sampled, sharply in favor of a high bias toward usage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> rules that are canalyzing functions.
The main caveat to hold in mind, in addition to misreading the articles or the articles being a nonrandom sample of published data, is that genes governed by canalyzing functions may have more easily detected genetic eects, hence, be noticed and studied. Only future work with randomly chosen structural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> will overcome this source of bias. Despite the caveat, I am quite convinced by the data. In particular, genes governed by high P values would also have easily detected genetic eects, yet there is no such bias in the data.
Tentatively, eukaryotic genes are governed by rules biased toward many canalyzing inputs per gene. Why? Either chemical simplicity or natural selection or both, I think.
Now let‚Äôs examine the consequences. We know that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , or more inputs per gene are generically in the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions are chosen randomly from the full range of possible functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , or more inputs. We have observed a substantial bias toward canalyzing functions. Does this bias suce to tune <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = or more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>?
Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> constructed large networks of genes, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuensche‚</ENAMEX>Äôs wonderful DDlab program, available on line, to examine model systems with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">up to</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. When we made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs and randomly chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions, their Derrida curves, as expected, were in the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, a percolating green sea existed, and vast purple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avalanches</ENAMEX> careened around the system.
When we made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = inputs, tuned to the exact distribution of fractions of genes with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">, , ,</ENAMEX> , or canalyzing inputs, the results (Figure .a) show that such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are clearly in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> curve is below the main diagonal. Therefore, in such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> a percolating frozen red sea exists, leaving behind isolated green islands, and the distribution of purple damage avalanches is a power law with a finite cuto at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> times the square root of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (Figure .b). This last predicts that the largest avalanches of gene changes if any single gene is perturbed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> should be about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This fits presently known data.
We even have tentative evidence of detailed evolutionary tuning. As the number of inputs per gene increases, a gradually decreasing fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions must be canalyzing to cross the phase transition into the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Although the data are too few to warrant conclusion, the fraction of canalyzing inputs for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = eukaryotic genes trends downward as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> increases along the curve needed to remain just within the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. This decrease as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> increases results in the virtual identity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>=<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> curves in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8.9a</TIMEX>. If so, only natural selection can have tuned it thus.
There are other clues, reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe</ENAMEX> in some detail, that support the hypothesis that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> lie in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. This interpretation is based on the assumption that the dierent cell types of a higher eukaryote correspond to the dierent state cycle attractors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> attractor is a liver <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, another is a kidney <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, and so forth.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢The</ENAMEX> percolating frozen core that is identical on all attractors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is likely to correspond to the core set of genes whose expression is known to be identical on all cell types, commonly thought to be housekeeping genes.
‚Ä¢The typical dierences in gene activity patterns in model cell type attractors, usually a few percent, mirror the data for real cells.
<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Ä¢The</ENAMEX> number of state cycle attractors robustly scales as a square root function of the number of genes in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. The number of cell types in real cells scales as roughly a square root to a linear function of the estimated number of genes in that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> to sponge to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the square root of , is about , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Alberts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> quote the number of cell types in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> as .
‚Ä¢The expected power law size distribution of avalanches of gene changes after perturbation of a single gene‚Äôs activity seems plausible and fits the still sparse data.
‚Ä¢Model cell types are homeostatically stable to most small perturbations. So are real cell types.
‚Ä¢If a state cycle attractor is a cell type, then cellular dierentiation from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to another cell type corresponds to a perturbation that causes the cell type to leave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> attractor and flow to another attractor. In the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, any cell type can only directly reach a few adjacent cell types and may, by a succession of perturbations, eventually dierentiate along branching developmental pathways to a larger number of cell types. Precisely this pattern of branching dierentiation is known in all multicelled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
There are other data, but perhaps that will suce. I believe the initial evidence strongly suggests that eukaryotic cells are in the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, not too far from the phase transition to chaos.
This hypothesis, which I here tentatively adopt as a candidate general law for any biosphere¬†¬†a very long jump to be sure¬†¬†is now open to direct tests. Current technology, based on Aymetrix chips, displays the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dierent genes</ENAMEX> in a two-dimensional array. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> can be sampled from small tissue fragments, or even single cells, and, via a few steps, caused to bind through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watson‚</ENAMEX>ÄìCrick base pairing to the corresponding DNA sequence. In this way, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transcribed RNA</ENAMEX> abundances of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes can be sampled simultaneously. Thus, we can now follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of cells over time, in normal and diseased <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, treated and nontreated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and so forth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incyte</ENAMEX> are doing just this and selling the data to the large pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> for analysis.
But then we can clone controllable cis sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> into cells at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more randomly chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and study the eects of transiently perturbing the activities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or a few genes. Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> curve below the main diagonal or not? Does a power law distribution of avalanches of change erupt or not? We can use the data to find the genes in the same isolated green islands, for avalanches should be confined to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and overlap if started at dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>. More, patterns of gene activities that change will change in correlated ways for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the same green island, but not for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in dierent green islands.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, recent evidence suggests just such correlated patterns of gene activity changes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Welsh</ENAMEX> has analyzed the transcription patterns of almost , dierent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in a specific cell type, the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanocyte</ENAMEX>, from newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, subjected to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> possible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dierent</ENAMEX> combinations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct modes of perturbation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX> could, in principle, distinguish increases, decreases, or no change in the abundances of gene transcripts for his nearly , <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. Of these, , showed no detectable change, about showed changes. Given <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> treatment regimes, the control, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> other treatments consisting of all combinations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> perturbations, in principle, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> raised to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> power, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about ,</NUMEX>, possible patterns of response. But, surprisingly, the genes showed only patterns. Already this is unexpected.
But the most interesting result is that, of the patterns, fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> mirror-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">symmetric</NUMEX> pairs: Under some conditions, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of genes increases in transcript abundance while a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of genes decreases in transcript abundance. Under other of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> perturbing conditions, the roles are reversed, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of genes decreases in transcript abundance while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set increases in transcript abundance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX> found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> such mirror symmetric pairs of sets of genes, suggesting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least eight</NUMEX> dierent coordinated sets of genes, each coregulated, yet each buered from the other sets of genes.
It may be that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welsh</ENAMEX> has found the first evidence of genes lying in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> dierent green islands, buered from one another by the percolating red frozen structure. If the green islands exist, they are the paragraph structure of the genome. They are the midsize decision-taking subcircuits of the genome. For each such island, cut o from influence by other islands by the frozen red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, has its own alternative attractors, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> for this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> for that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> island. The total number of attractors for the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> is then x x = . And if so, cell types are a kind of combinatorial code of the choices made by the dierent islands.
And yet more: My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Ballivet</ENAMEX>, with a minor bit of help from me, has come up with a means to rapidly clone most or all cis sites from cells. If the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of cis sites can be cloned, each can be used to anity purify the trans factors binding it. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biologists</ENAMEX> are learning how to construct small genetic circuits. By our means or others, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-first century</TIMEX> will learn to control the activities of genes in genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, hence, control tissue regeneration and dierentiation. We enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">‚Äúpostgenomic‚Äù</ENAMEX> era.
I return to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> law and remark next that cells typically do not live alone; they live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of single-celled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> or other simple multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, or they live in tissues in highly complex multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Thus, any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> law must be considered with respect to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
Consider an ecosystem with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dierent species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> may secrete dierent chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, that impinge on a subset, C, of the other cell species. In Figure . I show a three-dimensional coordinate system. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> axis shows the order-chaos axis for a single isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, measured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> curve criteria, with order on the left, near the origin, and chaos on the right. The remaining axes show C and S.
If a given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is at the phase transition between order and chaos, and additional molecular inputs, S per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, come from C dierent types of cells, the total connectivity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> is raised from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KN</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KN</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>. The results will typically drive that cell into the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> will be driven into the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
Hence, in the coordinate system of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Figure .</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igor Yakushin</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bios Group</ENAMEX> has shown that a hyperbolic surface, as shown, separates the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> from the chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Cells can buer themselves from chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">perturbations</ENAMEX> from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> by retreating deeper into the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. This can be accomplished by increasing the number of canalyzing inputs per gene. And indeed, as described above, individual eukaryotic cells do appear to lie well within the ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, perhaps as buering for the fact that such cells, like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, live in microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> or, like human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, live in tissues where each cell is bombarded with chemical signals from other cells in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
It is a plausible conjecture that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of cells, and tissues, come to lie on the phase transition surface between order and chaos. The hypothesis is readily tested. If so, perturbations of a single gene in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> type of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> should trigger a power law distribution of avalanches of changes of gene activities that spreads from the perturbed gene to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and to cells of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. Further, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derrida</ENAMEX> curve of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> should be at the phase transition.
A final numerical test is under way. The aim of the numerical test is to check whether cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> that lie at the phase transition would, in fact, make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and act without trembling hands.
Cells that are yammering at one another probably never reach their attractors. Pick a subset, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in each cell in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as its ‚Äúaction‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. Now release the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, numerically, somewhere on the edge-of-chaos surface. Over a long period of time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> action <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> will be encountered in some order, yielding <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">some</NUMEX> probability distribution of transitions between pairs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, as each cell is perturbed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> chemical signals from C other cell types. The transitions among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> action <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of each cell can be written in a matrix showing the transition probabilities between any pair of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. From this it is possible to calculate the mutual information, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> pairs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> action <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> is H(A) + H(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) - H(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX>). Here H(A) is the entropy of A, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>) the entropy of B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX>) is the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entropy</ENAMEX> of A and B. If A and B are occurring randomly with respect to one another, then H(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX>) equals the sum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>(A) + H(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>), so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> is . If either A or B is unchanging, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> is again . But if A and B are changing in correlated ways, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> is positive. Hence, we can ask what value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> maximizes the mutual information among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, how is that related to cell and community position on the edge-of-chaos phase transition in Figure ., and how well does the mutual information among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> action <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> correlate with the mutual information in the patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> input signals arriving at each cell type? More broadly, can selection maximize both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and that mutual information correlation and, if so, for what value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> and where on or o the phase transition surface in Figure .?
I do not know the answers but hope the optimal point lies on the phase transition surface, for such selected mutual information correlation would begin to show that such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of cells with such regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> can indeed make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and act on them without trembling hands to make a complex living in a complex world.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Candidate Law 2</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Assembly Reaches</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-Organized Critical State</ENAMEX>
First, a foray into self-organized criticality, a concept that will drive the rest of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>.
Per <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bak</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in published a paper concerned with sand piles. One is to take a large, flat table, supply lots of sand, and gently let sand fall from on high onto the table. As the sand piles up, it eventually reaches the rest angle for sand and also extends to the boundaries of the table. You keep adding sand slowly. Sand-slide avalanches begin to form and sand drops to the floor. Measure the size distribution of the avalanches and a power law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distribution</ENAMEX> is revealed, with many small avalanches and few large avalanches (Figure .).
Power law distributions can, in fact, arise in many ways. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of those ways is at a phase transition, for example, in a ferromagnet at the phase transition temperature. Above the phase transition temperature, the magnetic spins line up randomly with one another and keep flipping. Below the phase transition temperature, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ferromagnet</ENAMEX> tends to line up with magnetic spins all pointing the same way, say, north pole upward, hence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> is magnetized. At the phase transition temperature, something magic and ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù occur: clusters of spins oriented the same way arise, and the clusters have a power law distribution of sizes. The power law distribution implies that there is no preferred size scale in the system. If there were a preferred size scale, clusters would be distributed exponentially in size, setting a size scale at which clusters at that size were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as likely as tiny clusters of spins.
So too for the sand pile. There is no preferred size scale revealed by the power law distribution of sand slide avalanche sizes. The big dierence is that clever <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicists</ENAMEX> tuned the temperature of the ferromagnet to the critical phase transition temperature. Per and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> tuned nothing, they merely let sand drop randomly and gently onto the sand pile, and the sand pile tuned itself to criticality, hence the name: self-organized criticality.
Many of us have fallen in love with these results. Many are critical as well. I am on the pro side of the debate. I know the theory does not apply to real sand, with its rough edges, and works well with short-grain <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, but I love it anyway. Newton‚Äôs law of universal gravitation does not work for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of paper and cannon balls falling from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of Pisa¬†¬†wind</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, you see. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of paper do not hit the ground at the same time as do the cannon balls. Most theories have ceterus paribus clauses. But I suspect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Per</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> have found a deep truth about how nonequilibrium systems self-organize.
The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> laws apply versions of this idea. Even law above is a version. Selection tunes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of cells to the phase transition between order and chaos where a power law distribution of damage avalanches on all scales propagate across the system.
The claims coming next are not my own work, but derive from fine eorts by ecologists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Pimm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mack Post</ENAMEX>, and more recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Sawhill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Keitt</ENAMEX>, making use of work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>.
First, the early work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Pimm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mack Post</ENAMEX>, done in the late s: They were concerned with community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> into a local ecosystem (Figure .). They ignored long-term coevolution and made use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotka-Volterra</ENAMEX> equations. These equations basically say, for any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, what other species it eats, how readily it turns the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">eaten prey</ENAMEX> into an extra copy of itself, and how fast it reproduces on its own without eating. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX>, herbivores, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">carnivores</ENAMEX> are readily represented.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mack</ENAMEX> did a surprising study with an astonishing and still poorly understood result. They made a pile of hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critters</ENAMEX> in a computer, each governed by some plausible Lotka-Volterra equation whose parameters were drawn at random from some distribution. Then, with fond hopes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mack</ENAMEX> randomly chose <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after another and tossed them into the computational equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east Kansas</ENAMEX>. (‚ÄúKansas is a place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who like subtlety,‚Äù my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wes Jackson</ENAMEX> once told a group of us visiting his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>. We observed subtly dierent shades of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">brown grass</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX>, dust, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hawks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, and agreed.)
What <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mack</ENAMEX> found was this: When the first few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were tossed into east <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> in silico, they tested whether these few could coexist by running the corresponding Lotka-Volterra equations of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> simultaneously to see if the hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> all sustained abundances above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. For example, the model <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> might go to a steady-state ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or might enter a limit cycle oscillation or some chaotic dynamics with a strange attractor that remains above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> for all species.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dandy</ENAMEX>, the mock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was stable. They kept adding randomly chosen species. At first, it was easy to add new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but it became progressively harder until no more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> could be added. The deep mystery is, why? It is not a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or energy. Furthermore, on the way to assembling the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mack</ENAMEX> began to notice that as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> filled up, addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> species could make one or more other species go locally extinct. They began to find evidence of power law distributions of such extinction events.
Why? No one knows for sure, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuart</ENAMEX> has some wonderful ideas discussed in his fine book, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Balance of Nature</ENAMEX>. But I am going to move on to the recent ideas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Sawhill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Keitt</ENAMEX>, which build on the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> is famous for coinventing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherrington-Kirkpatrick</ENAMEX> spin-glass <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and hangs out at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> being smart. Not long ago, he took up what is called the ‚ÄúKsat‚Äù problem.
Here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ksat</ENAMEX> problem. Consider some logical formula, or expression, as in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> net. Any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> expression can be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúnormal disjunctive form‚Äù</ENAMEX>; an example is (A or A) and (A or A) and (not A or not A). In such an expression the variables between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brackets</ENAMEX> constitute a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúclause</ENAMEX>,‚Äù so this logical expression has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clauses. The clauses are linked by ‚Äúand.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Thus</ENAMEX>, for the entire statement to be true, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> clauses must be true. Within each clause, variables are linked by the logical ‚Äúor,‚Äù symbolized with v. (A v A) is true if A is true, if A is true, or if both A and A are true.
Now we can ask if the above expression can be satisfied by some assignment of true or false, or , to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> variables, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A, A, A</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> The answer is yes since if A = true and A = true and A = false, then all clauses are satisfied. On the other hand, consider (A) and (not A). There is no assignment of true or false to A that makes both clauses true since they contradict one another. More generally, an expression in normal disjunctive form, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> variables (A <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">v A v¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">¬†¬†¬† Ak</ENAMEX>) in each clause, a total of C clauses and a total of V variables <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A, A,¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬† Av</ENAMEX> may or may not be satisfiable.
The wonderful result that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> showed is a phase transition from Ksat expressions that are almost certainly satisfiable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ksat</ENAMEX> expressions that are almost certainly not satisfiable (Figure .).
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Figure .</ENAMEX>, the horizontal axis is labeled C/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Thus</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">x-</ENAMEX>axis shows the ratio of clauses to variables, hence, on average, how many clauses each variable is in. Obviously, as each variable is in more and more of the C clauses, with randomly assigned truth requirements, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vi</ENAMEX> versus not-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vi</ENAMEX>, the chance that the set of clauses can be jointly satisfied gets harder. On the other hand, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> goes up, there are more variables per clause, any one of which, if satisfied, satisfies the clause since the variables within a clause are joined by ‚Äúor.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Thus</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> goes up, the problem gets easier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, there is a phase transition on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/V</ENAMEX> axis at ln x (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>) or . x <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> As shown in Figure ., for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/V</ENAMEX> values less than this phase transition value, the expression is almost certainly satisfiable. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/V</ENAMEX> passes the . x <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> critical value, the probability that the expression can be satisfied plunges to near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.
Now, the idea that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> had was that building a community with random critters having random food and niche requirements is like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ksat</ENAMEX> problem. They consider S species. Each species‚Äô niche includes some of the S <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that it eats and some that eat or kill it. Thus, species S must eat S or S or S to survive, but can survive on its own only in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poisons</ENAMEX> the chloroplasts that allow S to be an autotroph. In disjunctive form, the requirements for species S to survive are (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S v S v S</ENAMEX>) and (not S).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> did numerical experiments for dierent values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> and C where again <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> is the number of alternative species any given species could eat. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S v S v S</ENAMEX>) corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = .They found the same phase transition. As more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are added, there are more potential interactions among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> since the pairwise possibilities increase as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the total species diversity. As this occurs, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> appears in an increasing number of clauses, so as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/V</ENAMEX> increases, at some point the satisfiability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ksat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> went from easy to hard. It became hard, then impossible, to add new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> filled up because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ksat</ENAMEX> problem went from easy to impossible.
I find this line of thinking rather interesting. Given rather general assumptions on the probability per pair of species of who eats or kills what, assigned more or less randomly, then as the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, hence pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> increase, such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> can fill up in the presence of persistent attempts at invasion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> may have found the underlying reason for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mack‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> results. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> have found reasonable numerical evidence for small and large avalanches of local extinction events upon entry of new species while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was filling up.
Meanwhile, experimental work assembling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> of real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> shows much the same results. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Communities</ENAMEX> tend to fill up and do exhibit small and large local extinction events.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Candidate Law 3: Coevolutionary Tuning of Fitness Landscapes and Organisms</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-Organized Critical State</ENAMEX>
Begin with a well-stated claim of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX>: gradualism. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Species evolve</ENAMEX>, argued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX>, by the gradual accumulation of useful variations that were gradually sifted by natural selection.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> is correct about contemporary life, and presumably about ancient life, based on the record. In fact, for current life forms, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> of hard work by geneticists, working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> as disparate as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> fly, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, and many other eukaryotes, demonstrates conclusively that most mutations are of minor eect. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> fly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> melanogaster, upon which I worked for twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, has the abdominal bristles alluded to above. A modest number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> exist that slightly increase or slightly decrease the number of abdominal bristles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> seem to mind, at least in the odd security of my and other biologists‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>.
More rarely, there are mutants of rather dramatic eect, none more so than the famous homeotic mutants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX>, which fascinated me and many others. Here a single mutant can change an antenna into a leg or an eye to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> or a head to the genitalia. These survive perfectly well in the laboratory as well, but one expects would not fare well in the real world.
Therefore, most of the heritable variation cast up by mutation is of minor eect, and gradual variation is persistent grist for the selection <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>. Somehow, current organisms have contrived themselves to be such that most mutations are of minor eect. But is it necessarily the case that all complex systems have the property that most mutations are of minor eect? And if not, where does the gradualism of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> selection come from?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, it is easy to create systems that are not readily adaptable by mutation and selection. What follows is not quite a theorem (and was discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">At Home in the Universe</ENAMEX>), but it will do. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of this book are competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">programmers</ENAMEX>. Consider a typical program, say written in C, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Java</ENAMEX>, or some other <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX>. Perhaps it computes something as simple as the square roots of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two million</NUMEX> integers. Perhaps it simulates an ecosystem. Whatever that program does, imagine trying to evolve it by making random mutations in the code.
We all know what would happen. Most mutations of a computer program are of major eect. The program won‚Äôt compile. If it compiles, it generates some vast stream of symbolic nonsense or goes into an undetected infinite loop and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhangs</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
And we can make the matter substantially worse by eliminating redundancy in the code. Any computer program can be written as a sequence of binary, and , symbols, where that sequence represents the input data to the program and the program itself.
Now, a well-known area of computer science considers how redundant a program is; for example, a simple redundancy would duplicate each binary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>. Computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> talk of eliminating the redundancy of a computer code to achieve the most compressed possible code. A fascinating theorem states that there is no proof that a given computer program is maximally compressed, but that if it is maximally compressed, it is in a rigorous sense not detectably dierent from a random sequence of binary digits.
Figure . shows a four-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> hypercube with all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX>, possible binary sequences of length <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, ranging from () to (). Each sequence is on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> vertices of the hypercube and connected to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> -mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> achieved by changing a single binary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> from to or from to . Imagine that the minimal program we were considering were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a -long</NUMEX> binary sequence. Then that minimal program could be represented as a single vertex on the -dimensional Boolean hypercube with to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> = to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> dierent sequences, hence vertices. A remarkable theorem due to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Chaiten</ENAMEX> shows that if there is a minimal program with binary symbols, there is at most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> such minimal <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-bit</NUMEX> symbol sequences. In short, only a single vertex on the -dimensional Boolean hypercube corresponds to the desired minimal program. Now consider each of the other <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-bit</NUMEX> sequences on the hypercube as a computer program. (Consider a gedankenexperiment, a thought experiment, for I have not carried out the actual computer experiment, and no one has been able to prove my following plausible, probably true, conjecture.) Run each binary sequence as the input data and program on our universal computer. Measure in some sense how far away the printout of that program is from the correct program for some finite chunk of the correct program‚Äôs printout. If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> started with the correct program, my bet is that since all redundancy has been removed, any single mutation to the code will randomize what the code does. Distant <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-bit</NUMEX> binary strings will, on average, be as good or bad an approximation of the correct program as its -mutant variants.
If one thinks of the measure of how close the output of a binary string program is to the correct program as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfitness‚Äù</ENAMEX> of that trial binary string, then the fitness can be thought of as a height. The distribution of heights over the -dimensional Boolean hypercube therefore creates a fitness landscape. In fact, my conjecture amounts to stating that the resulting fitness landscape is completely random. Neighboring points have fitnesses that have no correlation.
Assume my conjecture is true. There are theorems stating that there is no way to hill climb to the global peak, the single correct program, by accumulating mutants that gradually improve the program. Indeed, the only way to find the single good program is, eectively, to search the entire -dimensional Boolean hypercube. You‚Äôd have to look at most of the vertices on that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX> to find the working program. The problem is, as they say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX> hard, meaning the size of the problem scales exponentially in the length of the binary symbol sequence. But a single example makes a general point: Not all complex systems can be assembled by an evolutionary process!
It follows that only some complex systems can be assembled by an evolutionary process. And it turns out that an evolutionary process based on mutation, recombination, and selection, the genetic search mechanisms of current life, does very well on a special kind of fitness landscape, where the high peaks tend to cluster near one another and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the peaks are reasonably smooth, rather like the high <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>.
Then, as I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> asked in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> , where do such correlated fitness landscapes come from? More generally, I recall the no-free-lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theorem</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Macready</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wolpert</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macready</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolpert</ENAMEX> wondered whether, averaged over all possible fitness landscapes, some search algorithms, such as mutation and selection, on average outperform all other search algorithms, such as random search on the landscape or hill descending or picking birthdays, taking their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, and jumping that distance in a randomly chosen direction.
The no-free-lunch theorem proves that, averaged over all landscapes, no search algorithm outperforms any other. Well, my goodness! On average, random search and hill descending do just as well as hill climbing in finding peaks of high fitness. And here we organisms are, stuck using mutation, recombination, and selection. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and ecosystems seem to be pretty complex. Once again, where did the ‚Äúgood‚Äù landscapes come from, the ones that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darwinian</ENAMEX> gradualism works so well in searching?
In chapter I was led by the above to define natural games as ways of making a living. Naturally, ways of making a living have evolved as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> have evolved. So rather easily one gets to the conclusion that the winning games are the games that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> play.
And, as noted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> , those ways of making a living that set problems that are well searched out by the search mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">organisms¬†¬†mutation</ENAMEX>, recombination, and selection¬†¬†will be well searched out. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sibling species</ENAMEX> will arise and lineages will branch. There will be many species making livings and many cases of livings being made that are well searched out by the search mechanisms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
In short, there must be a self-consistent coconstruction of a biosphere in which organisms, ways of making a living, and search mechanisms jointly and self-consistently come into existence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Organisms</ENAMEX> are not solving arbitrary problems. We are solving the kinds of problems we can solve given our solution procedures. How could it be otherwise?
So, somehow¬†¬†and we will have to seek plausible mechanisms¬†¬†organisms are tuning the statistical structure of the fitness landscapes they are searching in evolution. But the problem is very much more complex than merely searching a fixed fitness landscape. Fitness landscapes are not fixed. If the abiotic environment changes, the fitness landscape of organisms changes, buckles, and deforms.
Worse, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms coevolve</ENAMEX>. My favorite example remains the frog and the fly. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">frog</ENAMEX> develops a sticky tongue, the fitness of the fly is altered. But so too is the fitness landscape of the fly, what it should do next. It should develop <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">slippery feet</NUMEX>, or sticky stu dissolver or a better sense of smell to smell sticky stu before the frog gets too close <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">or¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬†¬†¬†</ENAMEX>.
So, due to coevolution, the fitness landscape of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species heaves</ENAMEX> and deforms as other species make their adaptive moves.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sojourn</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coevolution</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NK Model</ENAMEX>
These results were presented in At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home</ENAMEX> in the Universe but are needed here. Since they are publicly available, I will be brief.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is a simple toy world in which an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes. Each gene comes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ‚Äúalleles,‚Äù or versions, or . Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> of each gene makes a contribution to the fitness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> that depends on the allele of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and upon the alleles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. In genetics, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> other genes are called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúepistatic‚</ENAMEX>Äù inputs to the fitness contribution of a given gene. The to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> combinations of alleles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes are therefore located on the vertices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> hypercube, like Figure .. The fitness of each type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>, or vertex, is written on that vertex and can be thought of as a height. Hence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> model creates a fitness landscape over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional Boolean</ENAMEX> hypercube. To keep matters simple, I assume all critters have a single chromosome, that is, are haploids. When they are not feeling sexy, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> will do as an example.
Having chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>, say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , the rest is done at random in the hopes that generic features of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> will show up in the resulting statistical structure of the fitness landscape (Figure .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">a‚Äìc</ENAMEX>). In one limiting case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> inputs to each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes are chosen at random from among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX> Each gene has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alleles, and . The fitness contribution of that gene is aected by which of its alleles occurs and by which of the or alleles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> other epistatic input genes occurs. Thus, each gene‚Äôs fitness contribution is aected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> + genes.
To study the generic features of such systems, I assign, once and for all, a random ‚Äúfitness contribution‚Äù to each of the to the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> + ) combinations of allele <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> aecting each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes. The fitness contribution is drawn from the uniform interval between . and .. Thus, instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boolean</ENAMEX> functions described above showing when genes turn on and o, here I obtain a column vector for each of the to the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> + ) allele <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> aecting a given gene, and in each position is a random decimal. Once this is done for each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes, it remains to define the fitness of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> with a specific allele at each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes. I define this as the average of the fitness contributions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes. The results yield a fitness landscape over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> hypercube (Figure .c).
I will briefly summarize results for the structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> landscapes. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> = , each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is independent. There is an optimal allele at each site and hence a globally optimal genotype. Any other genotype is suboptimal, but can steadily climb to the peak by flipping any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in a less favorable allele to the opposite, more favorable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, or . So the landscape is like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fujiyama</ENAMEX>, single peaked with smooth sides.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> is the maximum value, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N -</ENAMEX> , as in Figure .<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a‚Äìc</ENAMEX>, then each gene influences the fitness contribution of every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>. This is the totally interconnected system. Since fitness values are assigned at random for the to the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> + ), or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> input configurations when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K = N -</ENAMEX> , it is easy to show that the resulting fitness landscape is fully random.
A main feature of random landscapes is that there are nearly exponentially many local peaks, indeed the number of local peaks is to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> + ). For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = , there are local peaks on the landscape. Finding the global peak by hill climbing is improbable, and the system becomes trapped on a local peak. Other features include the lengths of walks via fitter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> to nearby peaks, which scales as the logarithm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, and the way directions uphill dwindle on walks uphill. At each step uphill, the fraction of directions uphill is cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>, yielding exponential slowing in the rate of finding fitter variants, hence, rather general laws about the rate of improvement slowing exponentially that we will discuss in the next chapter on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúlearning curves‚Äù</ENAMEX> in economics.
Now, on to coevolution and the evolution of the structure of fitness landscapes. Figure . shows a frog and fly, each characterized by an NK landscape, coupled together. Each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">frog</ENAMEX> receives inputs from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the frog and C genes in the fly, and vice versa. Thus, the sticky tongue of the frog aects the fitness of the fly via the presence or absence in the fly of slippery feet, sticky stu dissolver, or a strong sense of smell for sticky frog tongues. To accommodate the C couplings, each gene in the frog looks at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> + C inputs and has its table of random fitness contributions augmented with new random decimals. So too for the fly feeling the eects of the frog.
Now, when the frog <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> moves by mutation and selection uphill on the frog landscape, those moves distort the fly‚Äôs landscape, and vice versa. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coevolution</ENAMEX> is a game of coupled deforming landscapes. Figure .<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">a‚Äìc</ENAMEX> show coevolution in model ecosystems with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sixteen species</ENAMEX>. Due to landscape deformations as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species coevolve</ENAMEX>, an adaptive move by one species can cause the fitness of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> to decrease. In general, such coevolving systems can behave in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two regimes</TIMEX>, an ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> and a chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, separated by a phase transition.
In Figure .a the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-species ecosystem eventually settles down to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> where fitnesses stop changing. This corresponds to an ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> or unchanging evolutionary stable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> has evolved to a local peak on its fitness landscape that is consistent with the peaks occupied by its ecosystem <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. Once attained, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is better o not changing so long as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> do not change. By contrast, in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>- and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX>-species ecosystems, Figures .b and c, fitnesses continue to jostle up and down as species evolve in a chaotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, each species chasing the adaptive peaks on its landscape that retreat¬†¬†due to adaptive moves of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species¬†¬†faster</ENAMEX> than each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> can attain the peaks on its own landscape.
A major point of the coevolving NK landscape model is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> can tune the structure of their fitness landscapes, each for its own selfish advantage. Yet, as if by an invisible hand, the tuned landscape structure works for the average benefit of all. This toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is, to date, the only example I know in which creatures tune the structure of their fitness landscapes such that all evolve in problem spaces where, in some sense, they can search those spaces well self-consistently with their search mechanisms.
Here is how the toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> works. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is represented by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>. Hence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is assumed to be isogenic, except during the rapid evolution to fitter genotypes that happens as a fitter mutant of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> steps from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point to another point on the landscape. Very rapidly, it outreproduces its less-fit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX>. Hence, in this limit, the entire species can be said to hop between points on the landscape.
At each move of the computer program, any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> events may happen. A given species is chosen at random. First, it may do nothing. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, it may change its genotype, and if the result is that it is fitter in interacting with its ecosystem <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>, that innovation will be accepted. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> has evolved on its landscape and probably deformed the landscapes of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the critter can change the ruggedness of its landscape by increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> or decreasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Landscapes</ENAMEX> become more rugged and multipeaked as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> increases. The move altering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> is accepted only if that move makes the current genotype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature fitter</ENAMEX>. Hence, altering the ruggedness of the fitness landscape must pay o for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> immediately and is accepted selfishly. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> thing that can happen is rather mean. A random other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX>, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Godzilla</ENAMEX>, is chosen to attempt to invade the current species niche. A copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla, Godzilla‚Äô</ENAMEX>, connects to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> species‚Äô ecosystem <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and has a go. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla‚</ENAMEX>Äô is fitter when coupled to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> species‚Äô econeighbors than that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> goes extinct in its niche and is replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla‚Äô.</ENAMEX>
By the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> mechanism, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla‚</ENAMEX>Äô happens to have a beneficial landscape ruggedness due to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> value, that good landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruggedness</ENAMEX> has now replicated from the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla</ENAMEX> to its copy. So good landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruggedness</ENAMEX> can spread, by natural selection, through the model ecosystem, hence, landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruggedness</ENAMEX> can evolve.
The results are shown in Figure .. Indeed, landscape ruggedness does evolve to an intermediate ruggedness. During this evolution, the mean interval between extinction events increases dramatically, hence, the mean number of extinction events decreases. In this sense, all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> that remain become fitter due to the coevolutionary tuning of landscape ruggedness. In addition, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Godzilla‚Äô</ENAMEX> replaces the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hapless species</ENAMEX> that now goes extinct, its econeighbors find themselves interacting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla‚Äô</ENAMEX> itself. They may not be as fit interacting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla‚</ENAMEX>Äô as with the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, hence, they too may be invaded and driven extinct in turn.
In short, avalanches of extinction events can propagate. Figure . shows that the distribution is a power law, with many small and few large extinction events. Moreover, once a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> comes into existence, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godzilla‚Äô</ENAMEX>, it may not fare well in its new niche, hence, may go extinct soon. But if it lasts in its niche, it may be well adapted, hence, resistant to being driven extinct. The results (Figure .a) are a power law distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species lifetimes</ENAMEX>.
Thus, this model shows an invisible hand in which natural selection, acting on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> only, tunes landscape ruggedness. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> are, on average, fitter in the sense of surviving as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> for much longer periods, yet the ecosystem appears self-organized critical with a power law distribution of extinction events. Species lifetime distributions are also power laws.
Does this model apply to the real world? There is now considerable evidence that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past million years</TIMEX> the size distribution of extinction events in the record, in terms of the number of species going extinct per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">-million</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-year</TIMEX> period, is best understood as a power law, with many small and few large extinction events, (Figure .). Furthermore, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</TIMEX> distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, as well as genera and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, is, indeed, a power law (Figure .a,b).
I have discussed my own model primarily to focus on the fact that coevolution by self-natural selection alone acting on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> alone can tune landscape ruggedness so those landscapes are self-consistently well searched by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creatures</ENAMEX> searching them and their search mechanisms. We can, and presumably do, self-consistently coconstruct ourselves, our niches (and hence problem spaces), and our search mechanisms such that, on average, we propagate ourselves and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX>. It has worked for . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>. Were our fitness landscapes such that we could not search them, we would not be here. We coconstruct our ways of making a living and search out better ways of making a living while we jiggle one another.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is but one crude model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coevolving organisms</ENAMEX> and their coupled deforming landscapes. More generally, each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> has traits that are aected by many genes, the polygeny discussed above, and each gene aects many traits, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pleiotropy</ENAMEX> alluded to above. It is interesting to note that were organisms to evolve to a position below but near the biological reality that is the proper analogue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ksat</ENAMEX> phase transition, such a location might well achieve the gradualism and capacity to persistently evolve that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darwin</ENAMEX> noted and that we observe. Both the gradualism and capacity to evolve are related to the number of alternative assignments of true or false to the V variables that satisfy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ksat</ENAMEX> normal disjunctive form. If there are connected pathways from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such assignment via <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">-Hamming</ENAMEX>-mutant neighboring assignments that all satisfy the normal disjunctive form, then adaptive walks via alternatives genotypes are available, all of which roughly generate the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gradualism</ENAMEX> is achieved. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygeny</ENAMEX> and pleiotropy tune landscape ruggedness and deformability, which tune coevolutionary dynamics, perhaps to a self-organized critical state of an ecosystem.
There are, in short, dimly understood laws that allow the coevolutionary construction of accumulating complexity. And it appears that such coevolution typically is self-organized critical. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NK</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">coevolutionary model</ENAMEX> is not the only example of a model exhibiting self-organized critical behavior of model ecosystems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricard Sol√©</ENAMEX>, and others have created elegant models aiming in the same direction. In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol√©‚Äôs</ENAMEX> model comes closest to fitting the actual slopes of the observed power laws, which are -.
<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Candidate Law 4: Expanding the Adjacent Possible in a Self-Organized Critical Way</ENAMEX>
How does the biosphere, collectively, broach and persistently invade the adjacent possible at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, morphological, and behavioral levels?
I suspect there is a general law and mentioned it in the last section of the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>. It is my hoped-for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics for self-constructing biospheres. We enter the adjacent possible, hence expand the workspace of our biosphere, on average, as fast as we can.
Recall the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Noah‚Äôs Vessel</ENAMEX> experiment, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> ground up in a blender, breaking all cell membranes, comingling the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">trillion</NUMEX> or so <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of small molecule metabolites. A supracritical explosion of chemical diversity would presumably ensue. As I noted, life has learned to avoid that fate. Cells are subcritical. Were they not, then any new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> that chanced to enter the cells of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fredricka</ENAMEX> the fern would unleash a cascade of synthesis of novel molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, some of which would presumably kill poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fredricka</ENAMEX>. Best defense? Stay subcritical. Why mess with that mess?
But recall that a mixed microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> should be able to be driven to the subcritical-supracritical boundary by increasing the diversity of microbial species present and/or hitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> with a sucient diversity of novel small molecule species. My argument follows that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is supracritical, the novel cascading molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> will kill o some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">microbial species</ENAMEX>, thereby lowering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> toward the subcritical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. On the other hand, mutation and immigration should drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> toward the supracritical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Do mixed microbial communities hover on the subcritical-supracritical boundary? We have seen other reasons that bound a community‚Äôs complexity, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ksat</ENAMEX> problems noted in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>. So a better question is: Can microbial communities be driven supracritical? And if so, are they often near that boundary?
Of course, I do not know, but the hypothesis is testable. Increase the diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and test for the diversity of synthesized small molecules, say, by gas chromatography. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> and I once devised such an experiment with mixtures of increasingly diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">moss species</ENAMEX>, planning to measure the molecular diversity of gas species evolved as a function of community diversity and the diversity in gas species introduced to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. We went skiing instead. I still like the lines of the experiment. It could be carried out directly with mixed microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> as well.
As noted in the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, there must be some interplay in the entry into the adjacent possible that gates the exploration by the capacity of natural selection to trim away the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">losers</ENAMEX>. I described the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manfred Eigen‚</ENAMEX>ÄìPeter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schuster</ENAMEX> error catastrophe. If the mutation rate in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of viruses is low, by successive rare successful mutations the population climbs steadily uphill, then becomes trapped on or in the near vicinity of a local peak.
But let the mutation rate be increased. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> on the peak is deformed by the rapid accumulation of mutations and diuses away from the peak into the lowlands of poor fitness. Tuning the mutation rate compared to the selection advantage of the fitness peak compared to nearby values on the fitness landscape tunes this error catastrophe. Above a critical ratio of the selective advantage at the peak to the mutation rate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> remains near the peak. If the mutation rate is slightly higher, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> diuses into the high-dimensional hinterlands, lost adrift in sequence space.
The error catastrophe is, of course, rather general. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eigen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schuster</ENAMEX> consider a fixed high-dimensional sequence space, like our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional Boolean</ENAMEX> hypercube, which can be regarded as a sequence space in which molecules have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> ‚Äúnucleotides‚Äù and , C and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.</ENAMEX>
But what about an ever enlarging space of possibilities, expanding into an ever larger adjacent possible? Here too the rate of exploration of novel possibilities must be gradual enough that natural selection can weed out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">losers</ENAMEX>. If not, the biosphere as a whole would diuse into new ways of making a living so rapidly that selection would not be able to control the exploration, and we would soon falter.
So a general balance must be struck. We broach the adjacent possible by those exaptations that are not, I hold, finitely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">describable</ENAMEX> beforehand and do so at a rate that manages to work. We gate our entry into the adjacent possible.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Globally</ENAMEX>, for the entire biosphere, this suggests that we enter the adjacent possible about as fast as we can get away with it. On average, the global diversity of the biosphere has increased secularly. Indeed, it would be fascinating to know what has happened to microbial diversity in . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">billion years</TIMEX>. There are bacteria eating rocks down there <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</NUMEX> below the surface, in hot thermal vents, in the cold of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antarctic</ENAMEX> frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tundra</ENAMEX> and lake edges, all over the place.
I do not know the form of the law that governs this exploration. Perhaps it is locally self-organized critical in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">communities</ENAMEX>, multiplied by the number of eectively independent local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in the biosphere. But I can make out a law in which the adjacent possible is invaded, such that diversity and coconstructed, coevolved complexity accumulate, on average, as fast as it can.
I can sense a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law of thermodynamics for self-constructing systems of autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Biospheres enlarge their workspace, the diversity of what can happen next, the actual and adjacent possible, on average, as fast as they can. Clues include the fact, noted above, that for the adjacent possible of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-dimensional</ENAMEX> phase space to increase as the biosphere‚Äôs trajectory travels among microstates, a secular increase in the symmetry splittings of microstate volumes must occur, such that dierent subvolumes go to dierent adjacent possible microstates. Eventually, such subvolumes hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heisenberg</ENAMEX> uncertainty limit. As I noted, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> do touch that limit all over the place in the subtle distinctions that we make, turning genes on and o, smell sensors on and o, and eyes on and o, this way and that.
The whole of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX> suggests that autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> coevolve to be as capable as possible of making the most diverse discriminations and actions, take advantage of the most unexpected exaptations, coevolve as readily as possible to coconstruct the blossoming diversity that is, and remains, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Darwin‚Äôs ‚Äútangled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>.‚Äù I sense a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law in which the workspace of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">biosphere</ENAMEX> expands, on average, as fast as it can in this coconstructing biosphere.
A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> law for any biosphere? I hope so.
