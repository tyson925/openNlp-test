        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITALY AND THE ITALIANS</ENAMEX>
        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> down to the southern tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sicily</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>
        provides the most tangible proof that the world is indeed a wonderous
        stage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Architects</ENAMEX> and sculptors treat the myriad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and gardens as
        set designs, and nature turns the landscapes, replete with statuesque
        cypresses, tortuous olive and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fig trees</ENAMEX>, and rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, into so
        many artful backdrops for the daily brio and histrionics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la</ENAMEX> vita
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">italiana</ENAMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, the cathedrals, palazzos, monumental public
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and open-air piazzas are planned as if harmonious elements
        in unrivalled stagesets. Venice‚Äôs dazzling basilica, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doges‚Äô Palace</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Ducale</ENAMEX>), and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clock Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dell‚ÄôOrologio</ENAMEX>), all within the sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX> and adjacent
        Piazzetta, are the very focus of the city‚Äôs life. The same is true of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rome‚Äôs grand piazzas‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇNavona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">del Popolo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di Spagna; Siena‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unique Campo</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äôs elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza della Signoria</ENAMEX>. Conceived
        as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> and emphasizing the decorative space as much as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> surrounding it, the piazza satisfies the need of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> to conduct their lives in the open air.
        And we mustn‚Äôt overlook the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX>. In each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, at that
        magic moment of the passeggiata at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of each afternoon</TIMEX>, they
        stroll across the piazza, find themselves a well-placed seat at their
        favorite caf√© or stand in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to argue business, politics, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">soccer‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ the latter tends to be the most popular subject. Their
        celebrated gift for gesticulation aids the inherent air of drama that
        reassures them of the appreciation of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">joyfully</ENAMEX> live up to their legendary image than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orson</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welles</ENAMEX> put it, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>-odd <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> of them are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, with only a few
        bad ones, and those, he added most unfairly, are found on the stage and
        in films.
        Watch them at the wheel of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Long ago</TIMEX>, driving became a
        major opportunity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> to display their dramatic talents.
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> observed that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nation‚Äôs cars</ENAMEX> are like its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are solid, strong, and reliable, built
        to resist an accident; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> tend to be more fragile, but slick
        and spirited, built to avoid an accident. They are designed, above all,
        to indulge the national sense of style. The imaginative flair of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neapolitan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> zig-zagging out of a traffic jam forces the
        admiration of any nerve-shattered back-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX>.
        In the purely visual sphere, style has been a national
        preoccupation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo¬≠nardo da Vinci</ENAMEX> to the grandiose cinematographic fantasies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fellini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visconti</ENAMEX> in the modern era. It is evident not only in the
        splendor of the frescoes and monumental fountains but also in the
        dazzling design of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet Lamborghini</ENAMEX>, a coffee pot, or a fountain
        pen. The sartorially savvy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX>-town knows that good ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tailoring</ENAMEX>, and the textiles used, are not only to be found on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saville</ENAMEX>
        Row but in the meticulous workshops of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. The
        fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of the world have long been worshipping at the altar
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">priestesses‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇunrivalled</ENAMEX> fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>-old textile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> that supply them.
        The world also stands in awe of Italian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>. In the
        simplest trattoria or most elegant of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, the experience of
        your meal often begins before you sit down. Not with the menu, but with
        the magnificent display sprawled across a long table as you enter:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood antipasti</ENAMEX>, stuffed eggplant and zucchini, grilled peppers in
        red, yellow, and green, and whatever bounty this morning‚Äôs market
        yielded.
        If you take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> or train the length of the peninsula,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy</ENAMEX> offers yet another cornacopia of delights. In the north, the
        snowcapped <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> and jagged pink pinnacles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolomites</ENAMEX>; the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gleaming Alpine</ENAMEX>-backed lakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Como, Garda</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maggiore</ENAMEX>; the fertile
        and industrial plain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Po</ENAMEX>, stretching from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> across
        to ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Verona</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palladian</ENAMEX>-villa studded hills of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vicenza</ENAMEX>; and
        the romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>.
        On the west coast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera</ENAMEX> curves from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">San Remo</ENAMEX>
        to Viareggio on either side of the venerable port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoa</ENAMEX>. Behind
        the alternating rocky and sandy coastline, from the marble quarries of
        Carrara, the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apennines</ENAMEX> reaches south into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuscany‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhere</ENAMEX> lie the ageless beauties <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">of Pisa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lucca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siena</ENAMEX>, not to mention the smaller, and arguably more magical, hillside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towns of Montepulciano, Volterra</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Gimignano</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landlocked Umbria‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rich green countryside surrounds a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> triangle of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assisi of St. Francis</ENAMEX>, the
        noble university hillside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perugia</ENAMEX>, and the medieval mountain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post of Gubbio</ENAMEX>. To the east, the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citadel</ENAMEX> of Ravenna
        dominates the seaside resorts lining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eternal City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, lies halfway down the west coast.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 26 centuries</TIMEX> it has witnessed countless declines, falls,
        and rebirths, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> continues to resist the assaults of brutal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modernity</ENAMEX> in its time-locked, color-rich historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
        Another world unto itself, the exhilarating chaos of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>
        commands its magnificent bay, the visible isles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ischia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capri</ENAMEX>,
        and the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> in the shadow of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesuvius</ENAMEX>, its still active
        volcano. To the south, the former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorrento</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Positano</ENAMEX> spill down the craggy cliffs of the serpentine <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amalfi coast</ENAMEX>,
        justifiably tauted as one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful drives. On the
        other side of the peninsula, off the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> in the peninsula‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúheel</ENAMEX>,‚Äù are the curiously romantic landscapes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puglia</ENAMEX>, from its
        centuries-old trulli constructions to the medieval fortresses of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> emperors.
        Italy‚Äôs western approaches are guarded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the
        Mediterranean‚Äôs largest islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sardinia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sicily</ENAMEX>, both rugged,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mysterious</ENAMEX>, and steeped in history. Smaller islands with fabled names
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elba, Stromboli</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipari</ENAMEX> fill in the necklace of floating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gems</ENAMEX>, many reached only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, where the lifestyle is that of the
        Mediterranean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one hundred years ago</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruscans</ENAMEX> mixing over
        themillennia with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombards, Normans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spaniards</ENAMEX>, are
        as fascinatingly diverse as this panoply of landscapes. Each region
        sustains a solid and pugnacious local pride from historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> into
        the city-states, duchies, kingdoms, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lombardy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piedmont</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sicily</ENAMEX>. Nurtured within the
        geographical separations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Po valley</ENAMEX>, and the coasts on
        either side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apennines</ENAMEX>, it was this very diversity that created
        the richness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> art and its competing regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of
        painting and architecture. Significantly, the move toward national
        unity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> coincided with a dramatic artistic decline
        from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is only now recovering.
        Given its short history as a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, much of
        Italy‚Äôs patriotic sense seems to be most visible in the national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> (soccer) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. After the devastating experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mussolini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fascism</ENAMEX>, national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is rarely regarded as an obvious solution
        to the people‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> problems. If some form of government proves
        necessary, they prefer the local town hall to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> are naturally cheerful and friendly towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> there have been unprecedented numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>
        reserve their scorn for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">other‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇVenetians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX> or Milanese
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neapolitans</ENAMEX> comically bemoan the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>-imposed automobile license
        plates that no longer designate the driver‚Äôs origin. It is not so easy
        to recognize the home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>.
        Beyond the regional identifications, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> remains
        divided culturally, economically, and psychologically between the
        prosperous, industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX> and less developed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mezzogiorno</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(‚ÄúMidday‚Äù</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> was perpetuated by centuries of feudal rule
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sicily</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North</ENAMEX> developed more progressive forms
        of economy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> has come almost to the point of
        regarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs own Third World, as it offers a supply
        of cheap migrant labor.
        But the warm-hearted, high-spirited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neapolitans</ENAMEX> in no way
        feel themselves inferior to the cool, pragmatic ‚Äúmanagerial‚Äù types of
        the vibrant northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Italy‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two halves</NUMEX> come face to face in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turin</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat‚</ENAMEX>Äôs automobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> have for generations attracted
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mezzogiorno</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sociologists</ENAMEX> have noted that
        the transplanted southerners tend to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populist</ENAMEX> Juventus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiat‚Äôs Agnelli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, while the other, more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bourgeois</ENAMEX> local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Torino</ENAMEX>, is favored by the longer-established
        Turin citizenry.
        Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are not obliged to take sides. We are free
        to fall in love with the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and invariably do: it‚Äôs a
        glorious lifelong love affair.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Ä¢FACTS</ENAMEX> AND FIGURES
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Geography</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> landmass covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">301,245 sq km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">116,228 sq miles</NUMEX>). The familiar boot-like silhouette stretches <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,200</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">850 miles</NUMEX>) from the northwest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine</ENAMEX> frontier, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> to the

        Como, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garda</ENAMEX>, the fertile plain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Po</ENAMEX> river separates the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>
        from the rugged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apennines</ENAMEX>, running like a wall down the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolomites</ENAMEX>. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX> to the east lies the rocky coastline of
        the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX>. Off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrrhenian</ENAMEX> (west) coast are the islands
