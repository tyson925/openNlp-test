        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
        Inflation has taken its toll in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. While it‚Äôs no
        longer the bargain shopping destination it once was, there are still
        some good buys to be had. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is a duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and
        charges no sales tax, goods are cheaper here than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where
        they were made. On photographic equipment, electronic goods, and
        watches, you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        Specialty goods and souvenirs, often handmade, come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and
        elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Custom-made garments by skillful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> tailors
        are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garments</ENAMEX>. Note that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> are both exceptions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong</ENAMEX>
        Kong‚Äôs duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> and are subject to tax.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find that prices are about the same in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kowloon</ENAMEX>, and somewhat cheaper in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Causeway Bay</ENAMEX>, which caters
        to local shopping. Large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on the fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thoroughfares</ENAMEX> tend to
        be more expensive than smaller ‚Äúfamily‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> tucked away in the side
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Stores</ENAMEX> do not open until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10am</TIMEX> or later, but shopping goes on
        into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>, up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30pm</TIMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days a week</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central</ENAMEX> are an exception; they generally close at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6pm</TIMEX> and are
        not open on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>. The only holiday on which all commerce comes to a
        halt is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buyer Beware</ENAMEX>. Be aware that name brands, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electronics</ENAMEX>, are sometimes fakes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> may be sold as jade, and that
        antique you bought may have been made <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>. Always ask for a
        receipt that records information about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item</ENAMEX>, and if you buy an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antique</ENAMEX>, be sure to get a certificate of authentication. Needless to
        say, avoid peddlers who approach you on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and offer to take
        you to wondrous bargains.
        The large department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> have fixed prices, but elsewhere
        you should ask whether there is a discount, especially if you buy
        several items in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. Compare prices before you buy any
        significant item. Always ask to see the manufacturer‚Äôs guarantee when
        purchasing watches, cameras, and audio-visual and electronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>.
        Note that when haggling, the merchant assumes you are
        prepared to pay cash. If, after concluding a deal, you try to pay with
        a credit card, he may then boost the price in order to cover the card
        charges.
        It is advisable to shop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Association</ENAMEX> (HKTA), identified by a red junk logo.
        Membership imposes an obligation to maintain standards of both quality
        and service, and provides dissatisfied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> with an officially
        recognized channel for redressing complaints; the number to call is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2508 1234</TIMEX>. Pick up a copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HKTA‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Official Dining</ENAMEX>,
        Entertainment & <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shopping Directory‚Äù</ENAMEX> in which all member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are
        listed.
        Shipping. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> will pack and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> purchases. Ask if
        automatic free insurance is provided. If the goods are very valuable or
        fragile, it is a good idea to buy an all-risk insurance for the
        shipment. Packages sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> or to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> generally take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight weeks</TIMEX> by surface mail, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> by airmail.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shopping Areas</ENAMEX>. Major shopping areas are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsim Sha Tsui</ENAMEX> in
        Kowloon, especially along <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan Road; Central</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Island,</ENAMEX>
        particularly for upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> goods; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Causeway Bay</ENAMEX> for slightly
        better prices; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hollywood Road</ENAMEX> area.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department Stores</ENAMEX>. Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lane Crawford Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an upscale

        Factory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Outlets</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> sell excess stock or factory
        overruns. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is no longer a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory outlet center</ENAMEX> since much of
        its clothing manufacturing has moved elsewhere. There are factory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">showrooms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pedder Building</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pedder Street</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central</ENAMEX>.

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jade Market</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kansu Street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yau Ma Tei</ENAMEX>, is known
        for both jade and freshwater pearls. This is not the place to make
        expensive purchases, but it‚Äôs great for inexpensive pendants, earrings,
        and gifts.
