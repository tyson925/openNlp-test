        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of infinite variety, so a great
        many factors come into play as you decide which parts to visit. Do you
        want to see historic sights and tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>? Is
        weather important? Do you want to lie on beaches or hike in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>?
        Are there <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who need to be entertained? Do you want to do a lot
        of driving or restrict your trip to destinations easy to reach by
        train?
        To make the geography (if not the choice) simpler, we‚Äôve
        divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just five</NUMEX> regions: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and its vicinity
        (known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ile-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>); the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picardy</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Champagne</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ardennes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorraine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alsace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jura</ENAMEX>); the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy, Brittany</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loire Valley</ENAMEX>); the Southeast
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoie</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhone Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Provence</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAzur, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX>); and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South¬≠west</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berry-Limousin, P√©rigord</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Coast</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyr√©¬≠n√©es</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Languedoc-Roussillon</ENAMEX>).
        It would be impossible to name every place of interest in a
        guide of this size, so we aim to give you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> overview of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> rather than an encyclopedic listing of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúmust-see‚</NUMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>.
        You will still have plenty to choose from.
        Depending on how much time you have, you may want to combine
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> in order to get a sense of the great
        diversity of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> life: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and the wine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, the mountains, or
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> coasts.
        The itinerary for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is bound to
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Ideally, divide your stay ‚Äî sightseeing in the capital
        at the beginning, spending a leisurely time at a seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> or in a
        sunny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> in the hills, then shopping in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> at the end. A
        relaxing vacation, for example, might combine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and the
        Ile-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brittany</ENAMEX>. And for stark contrasts ‚Äî of
        climate, countryside, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>, and temperament ‚Äî combine the capital
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX>.
        However, the mix shouldn‚Äôt just be geographic. France‚Äôs
        cathedrals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> deserve your attention, but they‚Äôll be
        much easier to appreciate if you alternate them with time at the beach
        or on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> walks. And if you feel like being idle, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is full of
        quiet places where it‚Äôs a simple joy to do absolutely nothing.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do not have the option of going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
        outside the main holiday periods ‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. But if
        it‚Äôs at all possible, plan your visit for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>, or even
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, when the big sightseeing destinations are far less crowded.
        It‚Äôs best to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early summer</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>, and the island
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Michel</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Normandy coast</ENAMEX>, can be pure magic
        in the mists of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>.
        You will also have more opportunity to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        themselves; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX> many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Parisians</ENAMEX> flee the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the
        whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is full of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. You may find that you spend
        as much time talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amer¬≠i¬≠cans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scan¬≠di¬≠navians</ENAMEX>, and
        Britons as to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX>.
        A tip for visiting the big muse¬≠ums in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">peak seasons</TIMEX>: go at
        dinnertime on a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-closing day</TIMEX>.
        Getting Around
        Even if you‚Äôre the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> who likes to improvise
        and be adventurous, don‚Äôt turn your nose up at the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourism</ENAMEX> is a major factor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">France‚Äôs econ¬≠o¬≠my</ENAMEX> and every effort is
        made to enhance your visit. France‚Äôs office de tourisme in your own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> in larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> through¬≠out <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> can help you
        with information, brochures, lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bed and breakfasts</ENAMEX>,
        names of English-speaking guides, and so forth. Smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> will have
        a syndicat d‚Äôinitiative, which provides the same services. The official
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison de la France</ENAMEX> Web site (<www.franceguide.com>) is also a
        good starting place; the section called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover the Regions of France</ENAMEX>
        directs you to local Web sites of tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Handy Travel Tips</ENAMEX> section at the back of this book
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">page‚ÄÇ215</ENAMEX>) contains detailed practical guidance on the technicalities
        of travel in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, but here are some general thoughts to help you
        plan your trip.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, how are you going to travel? The excellent
        system of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and public transport (now enhanced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tunnel</ENAMEX>) makes the combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and train an attractive
        proposition. Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> for long journeys, and rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> at your
        destination to explore the back country. Several special rail cards
        include reduced rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> rentals and even <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX> rentals.
        With the high-speed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train √† grande</ENAMEX> vitesse) from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, you can make it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dijon</ENAMEX> for a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>, or to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avignon</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proven√</ENAMEX>ßal
        adventure in under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services</ENAMEX> also operate down the west coast to
        Rennes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyr√©n√©es.</ENAMEX> The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> frequently mentioned
        disappointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> trains is the relatively uninspired dining-car
        service. Don‚Äôt despair; make up your own picnic hamper from the local
        market before you get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aboard ‚Äî cold meats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camembert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX>,
        baguette, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> can add a terrific sparkle to the countryside
        flashing past the window.
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> in a hurry, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">autoroutes</ENAMEX> is
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class, linking up most of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and still expanding.
        Otherwise, it‚Äôs more fun to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> along the good-quality
        secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> (routes nationales, with a number preceded by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>).
        It‚Äôs wise to buy a detailed map of the areas you plan to tour; these
        will also show you the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, which are even more
        pleasant.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are adventurous and even aggressive, but not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unskillful</ENAMEX>. Patient driving is always a good idea, but timidity is not
        helpful in the Paris <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX>. In fact, it‚Äôs wise to drive as little
        as possible inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>; the p√©riph√©rique ringroad runs around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and it‚Äôs worth staying on it until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">you‚</TIMEX>Äôre as close as possible to
        your destination. The m√©tro (subway) is the fastest way to move around
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, both in the capital and the other big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>,
        are best for taking in the sights. Unless you feel really safe in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> metropolitan traffic, keep your cycling ‚Äî you can rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> at
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway stations ‚Äî</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. Even so,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> recently created miles of cycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> that crisscross the
        entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, making bicycling much safer (and more popular).
        If you have plenty of time at your disposal, consider
        renting a sail-it-yourself canal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or cabin cruiser and drifting
        slowly along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal de Bourgogne</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dijon</ENAMEX>, or the tributaries of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal du Midi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toulouse</ENAMEX> down to the sea at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√®te.</ENAMEX>
        It‚Äôs great fun helping the keepers open the locks. With a couple of
        bikes on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, you can always explore the countryside as you travel.
        Larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, plus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>, offer organized gourmet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cruises</ENAMEX>.
        There is a great variety of places to stay, from luxury
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grand hotels</ENAMEX> (what the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> would call a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>) and converted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ch√¢teaux</ENAMEX> and abbeys to simple country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> (auberges) and g√Ætes ruraux
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äî</ENAMEX> often a converted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX> where the farmer‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife cooks</ENAMEX> your meal.
        Addi¬≠tional alternatives are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> rentals and camping or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caravanning</ENAMEX>.
        However and wherever you choose to travel in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, one
        important piece of advice: even if you can‚Äôt speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> properly,
        it‚Äôs well worth learning just a few words. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> always appreciate
        that you have made the effort to say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonjour, S‚</ENAMEX>Äôil vous pla√Æt, or Merci
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beaucoup</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> are also a very courteous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Outside the
        big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, make a habit of saying an appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonjour or Au</ENAMEX> revoir
        when entering or leaving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> or caf√©. As you stroll around ramparts
        or along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, you will find that the local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will acknowledge you with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madame or Monsieur</ENAMEX> and a nod of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. Respond in kind and you‚Äôll soon feel at home.
        Being <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlitz</ENAMEX>, we‚Äôll try to help you with some of the
        simplest phrases (at the front of the book). The rest is up to you.
        Amusez-vous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bien</ENAMEX>!
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PARIS</ENAMEX> AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VICINITY</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and its immediate surroundings are a magnet for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventors ‚</ENAMEX>Äî in short,
        everyone except perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> and fisherman, who may well come to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to protest government policies. A vibrant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> sets
        tastes and fashions for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and the world.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> saw <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> as the only
        place to make their fortune, and so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from every region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France</ENAMEX>
        ‚Äî with every local cuisine to feed them ‚Äî are represented in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metropolis</ENAMEX>. Renewed pride in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France‚Äôs</ENAMEX> provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> is reducing
        this trend, but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> retains its aura of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">superiority ‚Äî</ENAMEX> and its lack of
        a distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>.
        Before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> became the national capital, it was the home
        of the medieval dukes of the region that is still known as the
        Ile-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">de-France ‚Äî</ENAMEX> which, by gradually asserting itself over other duchies
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Normandy</ENAMEX>, imposed its name on the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> basin is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX> of national monuments. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Roughly</NUMEX> bounded by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> rivers ‚Äî the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine, Oise, Aisne</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marne</ENAMEX> ‚Äî the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ile-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> was
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> cathedrals, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Denis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senlis, Chartres</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beauvais</ENAMEX>. It was the cradle of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> monarchy; its surrounding greenery and dense forests also
        provided good sites for later <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and nobles to build their ch√¢teaux,
        away from the troublesome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fon¬≠taine¬≠bleau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chantilly</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>.
        All the interesting sights around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> make for an
        easy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> trip by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or local <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, enabling you to keep your Paris
        hotel if you wish (although you would probably enjoy a change of scene
        and find the local country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> less expensive).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> share a boundless
        self-confidence that exudes from every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> in its monuments and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">museums</ENAMEX>, bistros and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every chestnut</TIMEX> tree along its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">avenues</ENAMEX> and boulevards, from every street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musician</ENAMEX>, mannequin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butcher</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baker</ENAMEX>, from every irate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorist</ENAMEX> and every charming ma√Ætre
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d‚Äôh√¥tel.</ENAMEX>
        You‚Äôll readily forgive the bombast of some of the
        monumental architecture when you see what makes this the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City of Light</ENAMEX>.
        Stand on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont Royal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX> and look down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX> to
        the‚ÄÇglass-paneled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Palais</ENAMEX>, bathed in the pink-and-blue glow of the
        river. This unique light brings a phosphorescence to the most
        commonplace little square or side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. To make sure the message is
        clear, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> offers golden nighttime illumination of its major
        historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. To celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bastille Day</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 July</TIMEX>) or the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25August</NUMEX>), blue, white, and red laser beams are bounced off
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de Triomphe, and H√¥tel de Ville</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right Bank</ENAMEX> still conjures up an image of solid
        bourgeois respectability. Historically the stronghold of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and
        royalty, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it remains the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of commerce and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Faubourg
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint-Honor√©</ENAMEX> offers the luxury of jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and haute couture; the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√©es</ENAMEX> claims the first-run cinemas, airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, and car
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">showrooms</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX> has, in contrast, always presented a bohemian
        and intellectual image, dating back to the founding of the university
        and monasteries; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorbonne</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX>, the
        publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and the myriad bookshops continue to exercise an
        intellectual magnetism.
        An unceasing flow and interchange of citizenry from one
        bank to the other takes place across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>. But
        despite these migrations, immigrations, social change, and urban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">renovation</ENAMEX>, time seems to stand still in many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> neighborhoods.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Areas</ENAMEX> may go in and out of fashion but each will remain instantly
        recognizable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> is one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capitals</ENAMEX>. Its non-stop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> scene derives from the fact that nearly
        every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> arrondissements, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>, has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> side by side and on top of each other. Get out and
        explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, the open markets, the caf√©s. You will find that
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartier</ENAMEX> has its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX>, different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to watch, and
        something special to offer.
        The Seine
        The river plays a central role in all visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs
        an excellent focal point, giving new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> an easy reference to
        establish their location; it‚Äôs a spectacular vantage point for many of
        the city‚Äôs great landmarks; and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and quays offer history,
        entertainment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shopping‚Ä¶</ENAMEX> and exercise. Despite the roar of the traffic
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voies</ENAMEX> express, you can take delightful walks along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and
        rest quietly on benches beneath poplar and plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
        A guided boat trip will also give an excellent
        introduction, displaying in leisurely fashion ‚Äî and with informative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commentary ‚Äî</ENAMEX> sites including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de Chaillot</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Trocad√©ro Gardens</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Palais</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palais Bourbon</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>, and of course many of the beautiful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bridges</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuf</ENAMEX> (neuf means ‚Äúnew‚Äù) is in fact Paris‚Äôs oldest
        standing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, completed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri IV</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1606</TIMEX>. It consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spans</ENAMEX>, straddling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de la Cit√©</ENAMEX>, and was initially populated with
        street-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">charlatans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX>, pickpockets, and above all
        bouquinistes selling old books and pamphlets out of boxes. Established
        booksellers on the island were enraged and drove them off to the banks
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>, where they‚Äôve been ever since.
        The centrally situated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont Royal</ENAMEX>, built for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇXIV in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1685</TIMEX>, commands some splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panoramas</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuileries Gardens</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Right Bank</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√</ENAMEX>©e d‚ÄôOrsay on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand and Petit Palais</ENAMEX> down¬≠river, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de l‚ÄôInstitut de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aca¬≠d√©¬≠mie Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX>, upstream.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont de la</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Concorde</ENAMEX>, truly the bridge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev¬≠o¬≠lu¬≠tion</ENAMEX>, was erected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1787 and 1790</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Stones</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demolished Bastille</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> were used for its support structure ‚Äî
        galling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royalists</ENAMEX>, since it had originally been named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXVI.</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont Alexandre‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇIII is undoubtedly the most romantic
        with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Belle Epoque</ENAMEX> lanterns and melodramatic statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fame</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pegasus</ENAMEX>.

        Start at the Place de l‚ÄôEtoile (officially Place
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles-de-Gaulle</ENAMEX>, but nobody calls it that), preferably at the top of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Napoleon‚Äôs gigantic Arc de Triomphe</ENAMEX>, from which you‚Äôll get a good view
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-pointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> formed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues radiating</ENAMEX> from the arch in
        a tour de force of geometric planning.

        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45‚ÄÇm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">148‚ÄÇft</ENAMEX>) wide ‚Äî has become a symbol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. Napoleon
        himself saw only a life-size wooden and canvas model of the arch.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Philippe</ENAMEX> inaugurated the final version in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX>, complete with
        bas-reliefs and statuary celebrating the victories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rev¬≠o¬≠lu¬</ENAMEX>≠tion
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napoleonic Empire</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX> was given a magnificent funeral ceremony at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arc de Triomphe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Unknown Soldier of World War I</ENAMEX> was buried
        here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eternal Flame</ENAMEX> was kindled. When
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> as conqueror in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>, this was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place he
        wanted to see. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Gaulle</ENAMEX> gained his revenge by starting his
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">march</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> that exit from the Place de l‚ÄôEtoile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> some
        of the ritziest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue Foch</ENAMEX> is a particularly good
        address). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√</ENAMEX>©es stretches in a straight line from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Triomphe</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place de la</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Concorde</ENAMEX>, bordered by chestnut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> all
        the way. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> are lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> salesrooms, cinemas,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and (expensive) caf√© terraces.
        After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rond</ENAMEX>-Point, there‚Äôs a pleasant, shady <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> that
        stretches down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gigantic Place de la Concorde</ENAMEX>. Despite its name,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> has had a tumultuous history ‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to a busy guillotine in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rev¬≠o¬≠lu¬≠tion</ENAMEX> and the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germans‚Äô</ENAMEX> last foot¬≠hold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> ‚Äî and han¬≠dles some aggressive traffic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is
        the most ancient monument in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-m- (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75-ft-</NUMEX>) tall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pink-granite Obelisk of Luxor</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses‚ÄÇII</ENAMEX>, dating back
        to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1300‚ÄÇb</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX> It was erected here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX>, a gift from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX>,
        viceroy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais des Tuileries</ENAMEX> was destroyed by fire during a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> uprising in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX>. Fragments of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> are still
        standing by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeu de Paume</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in the northwest corner of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardin des Tuileries</ENAMEX>. The gardens are popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who enjoy
        watching the marionette shows, riding donkeys, and sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> on the
        circular ponds. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX> there is a ferris wheel. Their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are happy admiring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">geometric lawns</ENAMEX>, neat flower¬≠beds, and
        classical statuary, to which has recently been added a collection of
        modern and contemporary works by such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodin, Giacometti</ENAMEX>,
        Dubuffet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Moore</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Lichtenstein</ENAMEX>.
        At the eastern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuileries</ENAMEX> stands the pink <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triomphe du Carrousel</ENAMEX>, roughly contemporary with the larger arch at the
        Etoile, visible in a straight line beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obelisk</ENAMEX>. This imposing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vista</ENAMEX> was originally planned for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napo¬</ENAMEX>≠leon to see from his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>, which was then a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the line is
        continued ‚Äî some say, marred ‚Äî by the modern skyscrapers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La D√</ENAMEX>©fense

        named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palais-Cardinal</ENAMEX>. This arcaded palace, with its garden of lime
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and beeches and a pond where the young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Louis‚ÄÇXIV</ENAMEX> nearly drowned,
        has a colorful history.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXV‚Äôs</ENAMEX> minority, it was the scene of notorious orgies. To meet the
        family‚Äôs extravagant debts, ground-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> were turned into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boutiques</ENAMEX> and caf√©s that attracted fashionable society, together with
        some shady hangers-on and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>. On‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ13</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1789</TIMEX>, a young

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caf√© de Foy</ENAMEX> to deliver the speech that set off the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Revolution</ENAMEX>.
        The royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> were set ablaze in the uprising of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX> and were
        subsequently restored to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of State</ENAMEX> and
        more recently of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Culture</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palais-Royal</ENAMEX> is a chic self-contained
        neighborhood of expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        Exhibitions of contemporary sculpture are held in the gardens, which
        also feature permanent exhibits of modern art, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Buren‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        controversial black-and-white-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">striped</NUMEX> stone columns.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palais-Royal</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> markets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum des Halles</ENAMEX>, a rather garish shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Around it, the

        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre Pompidou</ENAMEX> (alias <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaubourg</ENAMEX>, see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>) is very popular
        with the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>. The liveliest meeting-place is around the

        On the north side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Halles</ENAMEX>, another monument of the

        it is claimed to be the world‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, although the size of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faubourg-Saint-Honor√</ENAMEX>© is the city‚Äôs most luxurious shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. At

        Montmartre
        Long famous as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and bohemians, who call
        it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLa‚ÄÇButte‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Mound‚Äù</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartre</ENAMEX> is an essential piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>

        where, after being decapitated, the town‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Denis</ENAMEX>,
        picked up his head and walked away. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholars</ENAMEX> say it was really named
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mons Mercurii</ENAMEX>, and was the site of a pagan <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>.
        In appearance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartre</ENAMEX> is still the little country

        )
        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place des Abbesses</ENAMEX>, take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Ravignan</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13‚</NUMEX>ÄÇPlace
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emile-Goudeau</ENAMEX>. This was the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bateau-Lavoir</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>, an
        unprepossessing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">loft</ENAMEX> reconstructed since a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX> fire. Here
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picasso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Braque</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Gris</ENAMEX> developed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cubism</ENAMEX>, while Modigliani
        painted his own mysteries and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apollinaire</ENAMEX> wrote his first surrealistic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verses</ENAMEX>. Nearby, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">illustrious predecessors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Renoir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gauguin</ENAMEX> lived and worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Cortot, Rue de l‚ÄôAbreuvoir</ENAMEX>, and Rue

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hanged</ENAMEX>. The whole area retains some of the village feel, with a slow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pace</ENAMEX> of life, a variety of street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>, and pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caf√©s</ENAMEX>. On
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>, at the corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des Saules</ENAMEX>, look out for
        Paris‚Äôs own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vineyard</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clos de Montmartre</ENAMEX>.
        At the other end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>, you will come
        around the back of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romano</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine Sacr√</ENAMEX>©-C≈ìur
        basilica, towering over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> with its gleaming white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> and
        distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> and arches. Inside are splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosaics</ENAMEX>, but most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are transfixed by the external views over the descending steps
        and gardens.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartre</ENAMEX> is lively at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, with famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Au</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lapin Agile</ENAMEX>. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard de Clichy</ENAMEX> below, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pigalle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, sex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, striptease shows, and cabarets ‚Äî running from

        Marais
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marais</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, north of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands in the river,
        was built on land reclaimed from the marshes. It became fashionable in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> and wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parisians</ENAMEX> built luxurious private homes
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">h√¥tels</NUMEX>) here. Many of these elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> now serve as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">museums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
        Take the m√©tro to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rambuteau</ENAMEX> and start at the corner of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des Archives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des Francs-Bourgeois</ENAMEX>, named after the poor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who were al¬≠lowed to live here tax-free during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">France‚Äôs Na¬≠tion¬≠al Archives</ENAMEX> are kept here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel de Soubise</ENAMEX>, fronted by a vast horseshoe-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> was decorated by important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> of the time
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soubise</ENAMEX> are worth
        seeing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Upstairs</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de l‚ÄôHistoire de France</ENAMEX>, which displays a
        number of important documents, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Louis‚ÄÇXVI‚Äôs diary</ENAMEX> with its
        famous entry noting, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúRien‚Äù (‚ÄúNothing‚Äù</ENAMEX>), for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14‚</NUMEX>ÄÇJuly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789</TIMEX>.
        A garden (not always open to the public) connects the H√¥tel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Soubise</ENAMEX> with its twin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel de Rohan</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Vieille-du-Temple</ENAMEX>.
        Look out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert le Lorrain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fine sculpted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> over
        the old stables in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other noteworthy mansions
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des Francs-Bourgeois</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel Lamoignon</ENAMEX>, at the corner
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Pav√™e</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel Carnavalet</ENAMEX>, once home to the illustrious
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> of letters <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Madame de S√©vign√©</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√</ENAMEX>©e
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historique de la Ville de Paris</ENAMEX>.
        At the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des Francs-Bourgeois</ENAMEX> is what many
        consider to be the city‚Äôs most handsome residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the Place
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Vosges</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> and red brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fa√ßades</ENAMEX>. The gardens, once a
        favorite spot for aristocratic duels, now serve as a pleasant
        children‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>. The best time to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> as a whole is in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">winter</ENAMEX>, when the lovely chestnut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are bare. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX> used to
        live at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">num¬≠ber‚ÄÇ6</NUMEX>, which is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of his manuscripts, artifacts,
        and drawings. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings house res¬≠tau¬≠rants</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and
        fashionable bou¬≠tiques and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>.
        Finish your visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marais</ENAMEX> with a walk through the old
        Jew¬≠ish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> (or shtetl, as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> call it) around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des</ENAMEX>
        Rosiers, enjoying the wonderful smells from its delicatessens and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">falafel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cimeti√®re du P√</ENAMEX>®re-Lachaise
        The grounds of the cemeteries of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> are beautifully
        kept, and the avenues of tombs provide a fascinating walk through
        history. The largest, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">P√®re-Lachaise</ENAMEX>, has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> estimated at
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,350,000</NUMEX> buried here since its foundation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1804</TIMEX>.
        A little map available at the entrance will help you to
        locate the tombs of the famous, which include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rossini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chopin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fontaine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moli√®re</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Bernhardt</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Wilde</ENAMEX>.
        The Islands
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de la Cit√</ENAMEX>©
        Shaped like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Square du Vert-Galant</ENAMEX> as its
        prow, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de la Cit√</ENAMEX>© is the ancient heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, settled by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celtic ‚ÄúParisii‚</ENAMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as the third century</TIMEX> b.c. In the
        middle of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, it fell victim to the urban planning of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haussmann</ENAMEX>. The much praised but often insensitive prefect of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> swept away most of the medieval and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>,
        leaving only the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place Dauphine and the Rue Chanoinesse</ENAMEX> as testimony to
        the island‚Äôs rich residential life.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baron</ENAMEX> was also seriously thinking of replacing the
        triangular Place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dauphine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs gracious gabled and arcaded red-brick
        architecture with neo-Grecian colonnades ‚Äî but fortunately was forced
        out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> before the wreckers could move in. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> was built in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1607</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henri‚ÄÇIV</ENAMEX>, whose equestrian statue can be seen on the nearby
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont-Neuf</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> caf√©s shaded by plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are a world
        away from the roar of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        The massive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de Justice</ENAMEX>, housing the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> of
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, holds echoes of the nation‚Äôs earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, who dwelt
        here, and of the aristocrats and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rev¬≠o¬≠lu¬≠tionary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who, in turn,
        were imprisoned here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">before</TIMEX> execution.
        It also conceals a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gothic masterpiece</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sainte-Chapelle</ENAMEX>.
        The delicate walls of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> stained glass (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest) and
        harmonious proportions give it an ethereal quality in startling
        contrast to the ponderous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> surrounding it. It was completed in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1248</TIMEX> by the sainted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇIX to house precious relics, such as
        Christ‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> of thorns. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15‚</NUMEX>ÄÇstained-glass windows depict
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,134‚ÄÇscenes</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1789 and 1815</TIMEX> the chapel served variously as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">flour</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">clubhouse</ENAMEX> for high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dandies</ENAMEX>, and finally as
        an archive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonaparte‚Äôs Consulate</ENAMEX>.
        The sinister <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Conciergerie ‚Äî</ENAMEX> named after the
        royally appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">concierge</ENAMEX> in charge of common-law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> ‚Äî
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">welcomed Marie-Antoinette</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robespierre, Madame du Barry, Danton</ENAMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> others into its ‚Äúantechamber of the guillotine. ‚Äù Take the guided
        tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie des Prisonniers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salle des Girondins</ENAMEX> displays a
        guillotine blade, the crucifix to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Antoinette</ENAMEX> prayed before
        execution, and the lock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robespierre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. Look out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour des</ENAMEX>
        Femmes, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistresses</ENAMEX> were allowed one
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last tryst</TIMEX> before the tumbrels arrived.
        The site of the great cathedral of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame de Paris</ENAMEX> has
        had a religious significance for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 2,000 years</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX> stood here, followed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> by the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Etienne</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, dedicated to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blessed Virgin</ENAMEX>, joined it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years later</TIMEX>. Both were left derelict
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> invaders, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bishop Maurice de Sully</ENAMEX> authorized construction
        of the cathedral to replace them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1163</TIMEX>. The main part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>
        took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">167 years</TIMEX> to complete and, in its transition from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> to
        Gothic, it has been called a perfect expression of medieval
        architecture with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">majestic towers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spire</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">breath¬≠taking</ENAMEX> flying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buttresses</ENAMEX>.
        Despite its huge size, the ca¬≠the¬≠dral achieves a
        remarkable balance in its proportions and harmony in its fa√ßade. The
        superb central rose window, encircling a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child</ENAMEX>, depicts the Redemption after the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fall</ENAMEX>. Look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie des</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rois</ENAMEX> across the top of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> doorways. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28‚ÄÇsta¬≠tues</NUMEX> representing
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> have been remodeled after the drawings of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Viollet-le-Duc</ENAMEX>; the original ones were pulled down during the

        see page‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ78</NUMEX>. ) Inside, the marvelous light is due in part to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more
        outsize rose windows dominating the transept. To the right of the
        entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> there is a lovely statue of the Virgin and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Child</ENAMEX>.
        As with many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> masterpieces, the name of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> is unknown, but the renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre de Montreuil</ENAMEX> is
        credited with much of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> construction. During the 18th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, more damage was done by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúimprovements‚Äù</ENAMEX> of redecorators of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ancien R√©gime</ENAMEX> than by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary</ENAMEX> iconoclasts. For the present

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Viollet-le-Duc</ENAMEX>, who did extensive renovations from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845 to 1863</TIMEX> in
        response to the public outcry started by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> novel,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame de Paris</ENAMEX>.
        The only original bell remaining is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Tower‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        famous bourdon, whose much admired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purity</ENAMEX> of tone was achieved by

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile Saint-Louis</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile Saint-Louis</ENAMEX> is an enchanted self-contained island
        of gracious living, long popular with the more affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">celebrities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. In modern times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georges Pompidou</ENAMEX> lived
        here (on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quai de B√©thune</ENAMEX>), much preferring it to the ponderous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Elys√©e Palace</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H√¥tel Lambert</ENAMEX>, on the corner of Rue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saint-Louis-en-l ‚ÄôIle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voltaire</ENAMEX> carried on a tempestuous affair with

        The island‚Äôs fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Louis</ENAMEX>-en-l‚ÄôIle, is as
        elegant as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions ‚Äî</ENAMEX> bright and airy with a golden light
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illuminating</ENAMEX> an attractive collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italian</ENAMEX>
        16th- and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> art and some superb tapestries from the 12th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most notable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> with highly ornamental
        interiors is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel Lauzun</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 Quai d‚ÄôAnjou</NUMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1650s</TIMEX> by
        the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">le‚ÄÇVau</ENAMEX>.
        Today, one of the island‚Äôs greatest attractions is the
        quiet poplar-shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to the western end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">d‚ÄôOrl√©ans</ENAMEX> where

        Left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin Quarter</ENAMEX>
        What‚Äôs the origin of the name? Perfectly simple: from the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th century</TIMEX>, when the city‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> moved from the cloisters
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Left Bank</ENAMEX>, the young came to the quartier to learn
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> l‚Äôuniversit√© meant merely a collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who met on a street corner, or in a public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX>, to hear a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> lecture from a bench, or from an upstairs
        window or balcony. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> attend overcrowded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classrooms</ENAMEX>, but the tradition of lively open-air discussion continues,
        often over an endlessly nursed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> in one of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard Saint-Michel</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the
        faculty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, or in the ever-present cinema queues.
        The narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> near the exquisite 13th- to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Flam¬≠boy¬≠ant Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-S√©verin ‚Äî Rue de la</ENAMEX>
        Huchette, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue de la Harpe</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rue Saint-S√©verin ‚Äî</ENAMEX> give the feeling of
        a medieval world updated by the cuisines of many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and stuffy
        little cinemas.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place Saint-Michel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> buy textbooks and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stationery</ENAMEX>, and linger around the ornate Second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> fountain.
        Directly behind the square sits the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorbonne</ENAMEX>.
        Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1253</TIMEX> as a college for poor theological <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert de</ENAMEX>
        Sorbon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Louis‚ÄÇIX‚Äôs</ENAMEX> chaplain, it took shape as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> under the
        tutelage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cardinal Richelieu</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Students</ENAMEX> protesting overcrowding,
        antiquated methods of teaching, and stifling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> made the
        Sorbonne a focal point in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> invaded its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">precincts</ENAMEX> ‚Äî
        which for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> had guaranteed student immunity ‚Äî the rebellion
        erupted into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorbonne</ENAMEX> has since been integrated into
        the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> university system and lost its independence.
        Around the corner is the huge, domed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panth√©on.</ENAMEX> It was originally intended as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXV</ENAMEX>, but is
        now a secular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> of some of the nation‚Äôs greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>. In the
        crypt are interred the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voltaire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rousseau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zola</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assassinated Socialist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Jaur√®s</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Braille</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inventor</ENAMEX> of the alphabet for the blind. The most recent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> to be so
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">honored</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II Resistance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Moulin</ENAMEX>.
        Further up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard Saint-Michel</ENAMEX>, away from the river, is
        the large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jardin du Luxembourg</ENAMEX>. Despite their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> origins,
        these gardens avoid the rigid geometry of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuileries</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ver¬≠sailles.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chestnuts</ENAMEX>, beeches, and plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, the
        orangery, and ornamental pond were a major inspiration for the bucolic
        paintings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watteau</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every day</TIMEX> these gardens attract a cross-section
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisians</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early-morning</TIMEX> joggers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> on
        the pond and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> reading on the quiet benches.
        Montparnasse
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montparnasse</ENAMEX> took over from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montmartre</ENAMEX> as
        the stomping grounds of the capital‚Äôs artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>, or at least of
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Heming¬≠way</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Fitzgerald</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gertrude Stein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dos Passos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Dreiser</ENAMEX>
        also contributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living mystique.
        While other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> are known for their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montparnasse</ENAMEX> (named after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> gravel mound since
        removed) has caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> for its landmarks, most of them along the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boulevard du Montparnasse</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Closerie des Lilas</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Select</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> hang-out; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coupole</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sartre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simone de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beauvoir</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√¥me</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rotonde</ENAMEX>. If you want to follow in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">footsteps of the Lost Generation</ENAMEX>, this is the place for you; otherwise,
        you may find better, cheaper fare elsewhere.
        Towering over the quartier is the controversial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>-floor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tour Montparnasse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> block (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue du Maine</ENAMEX>) ‚Äî an eyesore to
        many, but one that offers a good view from the top.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Germain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des-Pr√</ENAMEX>©s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Germain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des-Pr√</ENAMEX>©s is a charming neighborhood as well
        as the literary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">quarter</NUMEX> ‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of major publishing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, literary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caf√©s</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise ‚Äî</ENAMEX> and a growing number of fashion
        boutiques competing with bookshops, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, and antiques
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
        The caf√©s around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Place Saint-Germain-des-Pr√</ENAMEX>©s act as the
        ‚Äúvillage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù On the north side is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√© Bonaparte</ENAMEX>, and on the
        west the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deux Magots</ENAMEX>. Both provide ringside seats for the lively
        street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> of mimes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, who pass the hat, and the
        neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eccentrics</ENAMEX>, who provide entertainment for free. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√</ENAMEX>©
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Flore</ENAMEX> up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> has more intellectual aspirations, and was
        popular in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sartre</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">existentialist friends</ENAMEX>. (Not
        all these caf√©s will be open throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX>. )
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Germain-des-Pr√</ENAMEX>©s is an attractive
        mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX>, with an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. To
        the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Bonaparte</ENAMEX> takes you to the prestigious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecole des Beaux-Arts</ENAMEX>. Incorporated in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> are fragments of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medieval</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> architecture and sculpture.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut de France</ENAMEX>, handsome home of the august
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Acad√©¬≠mie Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX>, is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quai Conti</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont des Arts</ENAMEX>. It was
        built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Le Vau</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1668</TIMEX> to harmonize with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> across the
        river. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">academy</ENAMEX> was founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardinal Richelieu</ENAMEX> to be the supreme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arbiter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> language. The academy‚Äôs lifetime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> ‚Äî chosen
        in hotly contested elections ‚Äî regularly produce edicts on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminology</ENAMEX> and usage; among words recently declared legal were le
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketchup</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">le</ENAMEX> hamburger.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invalides‚ÄìEiffel Tower</ENAMEX>
        The massive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel des Invalides</ENAMEX> was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">France‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it houses a number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, the most important of which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mus√©e de l‚ÄôArm√©e</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>), with exhibits stretching as far back as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX>
        Age.
        Set in the crypt directly be¬≠neath the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invalides‚</ENAMEX>Äô soaring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb is awesomely elaborate. His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, dressed
        in the green uniform of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chasseurs de la Garde</ENAMEX>, is encased in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
        coffins, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> inside the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-box fashion. The innermost coffin
        is of iron, the next of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mahogany</ENAMEX>, then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lead</ENAMEX>, one of ebony, and
        the outer one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>. The monument of red porphyry from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Finland</ENAMEX> rests
        on a pedestal of green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX>, encircled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12‚</NUMEX>ÄÇcolossal Victory
        pillars sculpted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pradier</ENAMEX>. Also in the crypt are the remains of
        Napoleon‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>.
        The military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> continues with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ecole</ENAMEX> Militaire
        and the spacious gardens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Champ-de-Mars</ENAMEX>, once the site of
        military exercises and parades and the series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World‚Äôs Fairs</ENAMEX> held
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1867 and 1937</TIMEX>.
        There are monuments that you can ignore and those you have
        to look at twice, and then there is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX>. Monuments usually
        celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>, or commemorate victories, or honor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>;
        but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX> is a monument for its own sake, a proud gesture to
        the world. Its construction for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">World‚Äôs Fair of 1889</ENAMEX> was an
        astounding engineering achievement ‚Äî <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18,000‚ÄÇpieces</NUMEX> joined together by
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,500,000‚ÄÇrivets</NUMEX>, soaring <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300‚ÄÇm</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">984‚ÄÇft</ENAMEX>) into the air but standing on a

        Like many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World‚Äôs Fair</ENAMEX> exhibits, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> was
        slated for destruction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>. But nobody had the heart to go through
        with it, although there was no shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who hated it.
        Maupassant, for example, signed a manifesto against ‚Äúthis vertiginously
        ridiculous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Verlaine</ENAMEX> rerouted his journey around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> in
        order to avoid seeing it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, everybody seems to love it. It has
        a popular brasserie on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, an elegant gourmet
        restaurant on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, and a view from the top stretching for miles
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a pollution-free day</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> dominates a quiet residential district that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses embassies</ENAMEX> and government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bois de Boulogne</ENAMEX>
        These <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">900‚ÄÇhectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,224 acres</NUMEX>) of parkland on the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> for cycling and rambles, horse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>,
        boating lakes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and caf√©s with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">open-air dancing ‚Äî</ENAMEX> and, in

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the main attractions is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc de Bagatelle</ENAMEX>, a

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is so huge that it can be intimidating.
        But even if you don‚Äôt want to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> admiring the art collection,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> itself ‚Äî a former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">France‚Äôs kings ‚Äî</ENAMEX> has much to
        offer and, if you plan your visit well, it is sure to be enjoyable.
        The main entrance is through an inverted glass pyramid
        designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.M. Pei</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">escalator</ENAMEX> takes you down to
        a reception area with the ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, underground bookshops, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caf√©s.</ENAMEX> Pick up a copy of the free handbook with color-coded floor plans
        at the information counter ‚Äî renovations and improvements are almost
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX> and exhibits may have moved since your last visit. Corridors
        lead from here to the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√ßois‚ÄÇI</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louvre‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first major art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX>,

        portrait of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> himself). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolution</ENAMEX> declared the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">650</NUMEX> works
        of art in the collection; there are now, it is estimated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 173,000</NUMEX>.
        So don‚Äôt be depressed if you don‚Äôt have time to see everything!
        If you‚Äôre planning several visits, you might like to
        concentrate on just one section at a time ‚Äî the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, for example, but not forgetting the
        important sections devoted to ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        antiquities.
        For an overall view of the museum‚Äôs collections, we‚Äôve

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> from river attack while he was away on a crusade. You can see the
        base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval towers</ENAMEX> in an excavated area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louvre‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> Web site (<www.louvre.fr>)
        offers virtual tours that can help you choose the most important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> for you to visit.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centre Pompidou</ENAMEX>
        The official name of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important
        cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre National d‚ÄôArt et de Culture</ENAMEX> Georges
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pompidou</ENAMEX> (after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> who instigated the project). It is
        also sometimes called simply <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beaubourg</ENAMEX>, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX>
        neighborhood that surrounds it.
        A combination of public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, modern-art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cin√©¬≠ma¬≠th√®que</ENAMEX>, children‚Äôs workshop, industrial-design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>,
        experimental music laboratory, and open-air circus, it is a popular
        place despite the initial upset over its unorthodox ‚Äúinside-out‚Äù
        design. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renzo Piano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gianfranco Franchi</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englishman Richard Rogers</ENAMEX> deliberately left the building‚Äôs service
        systems visible and color-coded: red for the transportation, green for
        the water pipes, blue for the air-conditioning ducts, and yellow for
        the electrical system.
        A recent redesign has added space to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of modern
        art, which is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Modernes</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905 to 1960</TIMEX>)
        on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> floor ‚Äî displaying works by such key figures as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brancusi</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandinsky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matisse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mir√≥</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man Ray ‚Äî</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporains</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> to the present) on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>. Among key
        items are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Braque‚Äôs Man with Guitar</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Matisse‚Äôs collage The Sorrow</ENAMEX>

        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Warhol‚Äôs Ten Lizes</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the simplest pleasures here is the stunning view of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> rooftops as you go up the escalator. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> crowd
        outside mingling with street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, and fire-eaters
        provides <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of free entertainment.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museums</ENAMEX>
        Though physically part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e des Arts</ENAMEX>
        D√©coratifs is a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> with its own entrance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rivoli</ENAMEX>. The rich permanent collection includes tapestries, furniture,

        that are held here, featuring great styles and eras of design history
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jugendstil, Bauhaus</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">1950s</ENAMEX>. Next door is the

        art of which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> is still the world capital.
        Across the river, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Orsay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>
        has been transformed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay</ENAMEX>. This exciting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>

        now used for temporary exhibitions (see page‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ55</NUMEX>).
        On the river side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tui¬≠leries</ENAMEX>, the compact Orangerie
        (closed for renovation until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2002</TIMEX>) is best known for its

        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">15‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. Organized bus tours start at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuileries Gardens</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue de Rivoli</ENAMEX> side. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX> are so enormous that you may prefer to see them at your own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pace</ENAMEX>, leaving out what your head and feet can‚Äôt take. (A little train
        will take you on a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35-minute</TIMEX> tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, with commentary in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> are available for rent. )
        With a little advance planning, you can transform an
        otherwise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tiring day</TIMEX> into a delightful treat. Try the following agenda:
        early start at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> market to buy a picnic; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> tour of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>; stroll through the palace gardens to lunch beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal</ENAMEX>; siesta and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> in the gardens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Trianon</ENAMEX>; finally,
        wander back across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace gardens</ENAMEX> for a last sunset view of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great ch√¢teau.</ENAMEX>
        The official <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX> Web site
        (<www.chateauversailles.fr>) is well-organized and full of useful
        information. In addition to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">show¬≠ing 360</NUMEX>-degree interior and exterior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">panoramas</ENAMEX> and images of many of the art treasures, it gives practical
        advice on how to organize your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> visit.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX>
        If you don‚Äôt already have a clear idea of what kind of man
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚ÄÇXIV</ENAMEX> was, take a long, hard look at his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Never did a piece
        of architecture more exactly express the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> of its builder
        than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ch√¢teau de Versailles ‚Äî</ENAMEX> extravagant, pompous, dazzling,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formidable</ENAMEX>, glorious, and vain.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚ÄÇXIII</ENAMEX> had hoped to make his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> hunting lodge a
        modest retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. But his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> turned <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX> into a
        self-centered universe that was far from modest, proclaiming his own
        grandeur in a vast, sprawling edifice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> and brick, marble, gilt,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> has been splendidly restored since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>
        with the help of private contributions, most notably from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX>. Wherever the original furnishings and decoration were
        missing, superb appropriate equivalents have been installed.
        The self-guided tour begins at the intimate little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapel</ENAMEX>, a harmonious mix of white marble, Corinthian columns, and
        Baroque murals with gilded altar and balustrades. The royal family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worshipped</ENAMEX> upstairs, looking down onto the courtiers in the nave.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grands Appartements</ENAMEX>, named after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods</ENAMEX> and goddesses whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> felt to be his appropriate companions,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> entertained his courtiers. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salon de Diane</ENAMEX>, the billiard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">table‚Äôs</ENAMEX> gone, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernini</ENAMEX> has left a superb bust of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> as
        reigning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>. The ceiling painting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun King</ENAMEX> in his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chariot</ENAMEX> and pictorial references to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustus</ENAMEX>
        Caesar make it abundantly clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salon</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôApollon was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇXIV‚Äôs
        throne <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
        But by far the most striking of these lavish royal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apartments</ENAMEX> is the glittering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie des Glaces</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Mirrors</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73‚</NUMEX>ÄÇm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">240‚ÄÇft</ENAMEX>) long, built to catch every ray of the setting sun in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        tall arched panels of mirrors. This was the palace‚Äôs grandest reception
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hall</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> gave his wildest parties and received his most
        important foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoys</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le‚ÄÇBrun‚Äôs</ENAMEX> paintings depict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇXIV‚Äôs wars
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hol¬≠land</ENAMEX> and his more peaceful achievements at home.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen‚Äôs Bedroom</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19‚</NUMEX>ÄÇroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were born, many
        of them ‚Äî as was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">custom ‚Äî</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> looking
        on.
        On a separate guided tour, you can visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Opera</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXV</ENAMEX>, and the king‚Äôs private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King‚Äôs Bedroom</ENAMEX>,
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> portraits by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Dyck</ENAMEX>, is set at the exact center of the sun‚Äôs
        path from east to west. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> was encouraged to come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> to
        witness the monarch‚Äôs rising from bed and moment of retirement.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚ÄÇXIV</ENAMEX> died here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1715</TIMEX> of gangrene of the leg.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardens</ENAMEX>
        If <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> gardens attempt, in their
        different ways, to enhance nature by ‚Äútidying it up‚Äù while imitating a
        ‚Äúnatural‚Äù landscape, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> garden ‚Äî which <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX> epitomizes ‚Äî
        deliberately imposes a formal pattern.
        Resuming a tradition of classical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> in his work at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Andr√© Le N√¥tre</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> and avenues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statuary</ENAMEX> to divide flowerbeds, ponds, and fountain basins into
        intricate geometric patterns. Pause for a moment at the palace‚Äôs
        western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie des Glaces</ENAMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> view of
        his harmonious, subtly asymmetrical arrangement of the grounds.
        As you make your way through the gardens, look back
        occasionally at the changing perspectives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Directly
        beyond the western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axe du Soleil</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Path</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>)
        leading down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bassin</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôApollon (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇXIV‚Äôs solar obsession
        continues). Adorned with sculptures of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mythology, this and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great Bassin de Neptune</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bassin du Dragon</ENAMEX> in the northeast corner
        served as centerpieces for royal garden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>.
        Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bassin</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôApollon is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, on which
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> kept his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> gondolas. Today, you can rent small rowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> here.
        To the northwest of the ch√¢teau, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Trianon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>,
        surrounded by pleasantly unpompous gardens, was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇXIV‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mistress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madame de Maintenon</ENAMEX>, where the aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> increasingly took
        refuge.
        The picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Trianon</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marie</ENAMEX>-Antoinette
        tried to hide from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, has the allure of a doll‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in
        comparison with the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>. Its gardens, with ponds,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mounds</ENAMEX>, and shady woods, are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> in style ‚Äî a relaxing change from
        the formality of the ch√¢teau. The childlike playfulness of the doomed
        queen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hideaway</ENAMEX> is reinforced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hameau</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of thatched
        cottages where she and her retinue pretended to be milkmaids and farm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>.
        Chartres
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most moving experiences on a journey through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is your first view of the silhouette of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chartres cathedral</ENAMEX>
        towering over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the wheat fields of the fertile Beauce
        plain. It‚Äôs a pleasant <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> drive from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and there are regular
        train departures from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gare de Montparnasse</ENAMEX>.
        This unquestionable masterpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> civilization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX> the transition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX> from the solid, sober
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beginnings to the more airy, assertive
        Gothic of its ascendancy. Apart from a few decapitated statues, it came
        miraculously unscathed through the Wars of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religion</ENAMEX> and the
        Revolution.
        As you face the harmoniously asymmetrical western fa√ßade,
        the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clocher Vieux</ENAMEX>, is a prime example of
        Roman¬≠esque simplicity, whereas the taller northern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, the Clocher
        Neuf, is already lighter, with its slender, more ornate steeple.
        On the central porch, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portail Royal</ENAMEX>, the stately,
        deliberately elongated sculptures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Testament</ENAMEX> figures contrast
        with the freer, more vigorous statuary that adorns the church‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northern</ENAMEX> and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX>.
        Perhaps the most famous feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is its
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">173‚</NUMEX>ÄÇstained-glass windows. Their unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúChartres blue‚Äù</ENAMEX> and deep red
        bring an ethereal light into the nave, especially when the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-afternoon</TIMEX> sun is shining through the western rose window depicting
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Judgment</ENAMEX>. Among the oldest and most famous of the windows, on
        the southern side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>, is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthroned</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> on her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame de la Belle Verri√®re.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>,
        representing her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">175‚</NUMEX>ÄÇtimes in the various sculptures and windows.
        In the paving of the center aisle of the nave is a large
        circular labyrinth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medieval</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">penitents</ENAMEX> traced its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> on hands and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">knees</ENAMEX>, from the circumference to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a symbolic spiritual
        journey.
        Back outside, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Episcopal Garden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardin de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">l‚ÄôEv√™ch√©</ENAMEX>), at the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, a stairway takes you down to
        the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of attractive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th- and 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>,
        built along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eure river</ENAMEX>, offer a pretty view of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>.
        Fontainebleau
        The huge royal palace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fontainebleau</ENAMEX> is an elegant
        monument to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> tastes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fran√ßois‚ÄÇI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henri‚ÄÇIV</ENAMEX>, although
        subsequent monarchs added on and generally refurbished. Key features
        are the‚ÄÇhorseshoe-shaped staircase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escalier du Fer-√†-Cheval</ENAMEX>) at the
        end of the stately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour du</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheval Blanc</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ballroom</ENAMEX> whose
        ornate ceiling is reflected in the parquet floor; and the allegorical
        paintings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galerie Francois‚ÄÇIer.</ENAMEX>
        Napoleon was fond of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fon¬≠taine¬≠bleau</ENAMEX> and he refurnished
        the pal¬≠ace after the looting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>. It was at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fon¬≠taine¬≠bleau</ENAMEX> that he abdicated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1814</TIMEX> to go into his first exile on
        the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elba</ENAMEX>. Napoleon‚Äôs apart¬≠ments display the style of his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">empire</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napo¬</ENAMEX>≠leonic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has been installed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇXV
        wing.
        Although there‚Äôs enough to see inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fontainebleau</ENAMEX> to
        keep you busy for a day or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> prefer to spend the bulk
        of their time exploring the beautiful grounds and the spectacular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forest of Fontainebleau</ENAMEX> ‚Äî <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25,000‚ÄÇhectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 60,000‚ÄÇacres</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beech</ENAMEX>, silver birch, pine, chestnut, and hornbeam.
        You can opt for a delightful, leisurely walk or a lengthy
        hike over well-marked paths, and climbers will find a miniature
        mountain range of sheer rock faces and cliffs. The most popular are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rugged Gorges de Franchard</ENAMEX>, due west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gorges</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d‚ÄôApre¬≠mont</ENAMEX> (near the little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbizon</ENAMEX>, famed as a haunt of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>) tend to be less crowded.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Chantilly</ENAMEX>
        Located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">30‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chantilly</ENAMEX> is
        celebrated for its ch√¢teau, its elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">racecourse</ENAMEX> and stables, and,
        not least, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cr√®me chantilly</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whipped cream</ENAMEX>) typically served on
        hot waffles.
        The ch√¢teau, which belonged to the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cond√</ENAMEX>© dynasty
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, consists of a reconstruction of the great edifice
        destroyed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> ‚Äî known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Ch√¢teau ‚Äî</ENAMEX> joined to
        the charming, authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√¢teau.</ENAMEX>
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ch√¢teau houses</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Cond√©</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">superb</ENAMEX> collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX>, including
        works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael, Fra Angelico, Poussin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watteau</ENAMEX>, and portraits by
        Clouet, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Dyck</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teniers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the charms of the collection is
        that the paintings are hung not in any classical order but according to
        the personal whim of their last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aumale</ENAMEX>.
        The palace grounds are a pleasant place for a walk,
        especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English Garden</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Ch√¢teau.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚ÄÇXIV</ENAMEX> was
        very envious of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, ponds, and waterfalls designed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Andr√© Le N√¥tre</ENAMEX> and insisted the master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> do even better at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX>.
        Boat rides give you another perspective of the ch√¢teau and
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and you can also enjoy a relaxing view from a tethered hot-air
        balloon.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX>, west of the ch√¢teau, is host to
        the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prix du Jockey Club</ENAMEX> horse race. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round, you
        can visit the monumental <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grandes-Ecuries</ENAMEX> (stables), now a

        This intellectual, cultural, and economic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> has

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> have been lovingly restored. The

        The great popular attraction, situated in the southern arm

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guardian</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">city‚Äôs medieval</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> treasures,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de l‚ÄôOeuvre Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> is itself made up of a superb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        14th-, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">16th-</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> around a secluded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> garden
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place du Ch√¢teau</ENAMEX>, south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. Besides sheltering the

        windows from the earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> building, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        has a fine collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alsatian medieval</ENAMEX> painting by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konrad Witz</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Schongauer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Baldung Grien</ENAMEX>.
        In the midst of the predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Germanic</ENAMEX> old city
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√¢teau des Rohan</ENAMEX>, the classical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>
        that was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strasbourg‚</ENAMEX>Äôs princes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinals</ENAMEX>, makes an

        The furniture collection of the ch√¢teau‚Äôs delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√</ENAMEX>©e
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Arts D√©coratifs</ENAMEX> offers interesting comparisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>. But the museum‚Äôs pride and joy is its great ceramics

        Make your way westward to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont Saint-Martin</ENAMEX> for a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> view of the city‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most enchanting quarter</TIMEX>, the old tannery
        district known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Petite France</ENAMEX>. At a point where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ill</ENAMEX> divides into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tanners</ENAMEX> shared the waterways with the millers and

        soaring silhouette of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. At sunset it makes the perfect
        finish to a day‚Äôs walk but many like to start out from here and reverse
        the order of the walk we have proposed, reserving the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> for a
        triumphant climax.
        Route du Vin
        Sheltered from the cold, damp, northwest winds by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vosges mountains</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards of Alsace</ENAMEX> enjoy an ideal microclimate
        for producing white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> that confidently hold their own against the
        more famous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> hug the gentle slopes between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vosges</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhine Valley</ENAMEX> along a single narrow <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75-mile</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> that

        outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mulhouse</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">winding ‚Äúwine route‚</ENAMEX>Äù is well signposted; its

        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, best of all during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> harvest. Tasting
        and purchases are possible at many of the properties. Ask at the local
        syndicat d‚Äôinitiative or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colmar‚Äôs Maison du Vin</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAlsace for
        information about the vineyard tours organized from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obernai</ENAMEX> and
        Turckheim, among others.
        A walk around the lovely shaded ramparts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obernai</ENAMEX> will
        convince you of the perennial prosperity of its wine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX> and

        Equally famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Riesling</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riquewihr</ENAMEX> is often overcrowded during the tourist
        season. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Cars</ENAMEX> must be left at the southern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. If you
        arrive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riquewihr</ENAMEX> on a quiet day, have a good look at the stately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maison Liebrich</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1535</TIMEX>) and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maison Preiss-Zimmer</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1686</TIMEX>), on the

        Just before you reach the main gate and town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dolder</ENAMEX>, turn off to the right and take a peep at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">little ¬≠ghetto</ENAMEX> in the wooden-galleried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour des Juifs</ENAMEX>. And for those
        who enjoy inspecting ancient instruments of terror and torture, there‚Äôs
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval chamber</ENAMEX> of horrors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tour des Voleurs</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thieves‚Äô‚ÄÇTower</ENAMEX>).
        Nestling at the foot of its ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, the pretty
        medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaysersberg</ENAMEX> is widely known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobel</ENAMEX>
        Peace <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prize</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Schweitzer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1875‚Äì1965</ENAMEX>). His parents‚Äô house

        also a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bach‚</ENAMEX>Äôs organ works.
        The parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eglise Sainte-Croix</ENAMEX>, is worth a
        visit for the splendid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> altarpiece by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Bongartz</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colmar</ENAMEX>. It is a polychrome sculpted wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triptych</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18‚ÄÇpanels</NUMEX>, which
        portray <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> in moving detail. A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> walk up
        the wooded hill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle tower</ENAMEX> gives a delightful view of the town
        and the surrounding valley of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weiss</ENAMEX> river.
        To escape the madding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, seek out the unspoiled little

        Colmar
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make a pilgrimage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colmar</ENAMEX> with the sole
        purpose of visiting the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mus√©e d‚ÄôUnterlinden</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself,
        with its miraculously preserved old city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, has much else to
        offer. It also makes a quieter alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Strasbourg</ENAMEX> as a base for
        touring the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards of Alsace</ENAMEX>.
        Converted from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican</ENAMEX> nuns,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mus√©e d‚ÄôUnterlinden</ENAMEX> provides a perfect setting in which to view one
        of the world‚Äôs undisputed masterpieces of religious art, Matthias
        Gr√ºnewald‚Äôs awe-inspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isenheim</ENAMEX> altarpiece. Created for the
        Isen¬≠heim <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Anthony</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1512 and 1516</TIMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">altar¬≠piece</ENAMEX> originally folded out in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>, which are now
        mounted for exhibition in separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. To appreciate the full
        impact of the whole work, view it in reverse order, starting at the far
        end with the stately sculpted polychrome wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saints</TIMEX>
        Augustine, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome</ENAMEX>, carved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niklaus Hagenauer</ENAMEX>. The first
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gr√ºnewald‚Äôs</ENAMEX> painted panels depicts on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side the conversion and
        temptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony</ENAMEX> and on the other the birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> and a chorus
        of angels. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> is devoted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Annun¬≠ci¬≠a¬≠tion</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resurrection</ENAMEX> and, on the reverse side, what is perhaps the most
        pain-filled and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exalted</ENAMEX> portrayal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crucifixion</ENAMEX> ever realized.
        Be sure also to see the superb altarpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin</ENAMEX>
        Schongauer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Holbein‚</ENAMEX>Äôs portrait of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas Cranach‚</ENAMEX>Äôs

        Bonnard, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX> offers an intriguing counterpoint.
        In the old town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> ‚Äî which is closed to traffic ‚Äî keep

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tower of Saint Martin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the distance. The district on the

        mainly by market <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX> who used to sell their wares from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX> on
        the river. It still holds on to its original name of Krutenau

        It is the main distribution point for the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chablis</ENAMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>,

        This is just one out of a score of leisurely backroad
        trips you can make through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Burgundy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs meandering green
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valleys</ENAMEX>. Either cutting across from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tonnerre</ENAMEX> (home of a beautiful
        circular lavoir at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fosse Dionne</ENAMEX>) or starting out from the village
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chablis</ENAMEX>, follow the course of the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Serein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> (a tributary
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yonne</ENAMEX>) toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Avallon</ENAMEX>.
        You will pass huge farmhouses, characteristically roofed
        with laves ‚Äî flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">volcanic-stone tiles ‚Äî</ENAMEX> that add color and texture to
        the landscape. The finely arched front doors are often at the top of a
        sturdy staircase over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-level <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar</ENAMEX>. You can spot, set in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> walls, little sculpted heads of angels or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX>, floral motifs,
        or the scallop <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> (coquille <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Jacques</ENAMEX>) marking the route of
        medieval pilgrims to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago de Compostela</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noyers</ENAMEX> is a fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">medieval village</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16‚ÄÇtowers</NUMEX> in
        its ramparts. Many of its timbered and gabled houses date back to the
        14th and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th centuries</TIMEX>, particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Place de l‚ÄôH√¥tel-de</ENAMEX>-Ville
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue du Poids-du-Roy</ENAMEX>. From the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>,
        there‚Äôs a pretty view over the winding river.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L‚ÄôIsle-sur-Serein</ENAMEX>, the river divides to encircle the
        tranquil little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and the ruins of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ch√¢teau</ENAMEX>.
        Leave the river briefly to loop east around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Talcy</ENAMEX>, with
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ch√¢teau</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thizy</ENAMEX>, before
        ending your trip at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montr√©al.</ENAMEX> This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">medieval town</ENAMEX> boasts a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> church
        with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> interior; note the carved oak <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> stalls and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbaye de Fontenay</ENAMEX>
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cistercian abbey</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 6‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) from
        Montbard, standing behind high walls in a lovely valley at the edge of
        a forest. Found¬≠ed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 12th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Bernard</ENAMEX>, it
        includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, cloisters, scriptorium, refectory, sleeping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quarters</ENAMEX>, infirmary, forge, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bakery</ENAMEX>, and herb garden ‚Äî everything for a
        self-sufficient community. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was converted into a paper mill
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, but has since been restored and the cloisters once
        again present the calm and simplicity that were the ideals of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>.
        As you go through the gate decorated with the arms of the
        Cister¬≠cian order, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> notice a niche for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> dog below the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staircase</ENAMEX>. On the right is an austere hostel and chapel for the few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX> who passed this way, and beyond it the forge of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hard-working Cister¬≠cians.</ENAMEX> To the left of the entrance are the monks‚Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bakery</ENAMEX> and an imposing pigeon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">loft</ENAMEX>.
        Paid for by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop Everard of Norwich</ENAMEX>, for whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fontenay</ENAMEX>
        was a refuge from the hostility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry‚ÄÇII of England</ENAMEX>, the abbey
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> has a sober, unadorned beauty ‚Äî no bell¬≠tower, as there were no
        distant faithful to be called to worship, but harmonious proportions in
        the interior, and fine acoustics because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX> was a great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> of music. A serene statue of the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th century</TIMEX>)
        stands in the north arm of the transept.

        V√©zelay
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of spirituality in a beautiful rustic setting,
        V√©zelay is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> on the pilgrim route

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it welcomes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, in large numbers. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">you‚Äôre</ENAMEX> traveling at
        the height of the tourist season, this is a place where it is vital to
        make a really early start.
        To recapture something of the experience of the medieval
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pilgrim</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place du Champ-de-Foire</ENAMEX>, pass through the turreted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porte Neuve</ENAMEX>, and follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promenade des Foss√©s</ENAMEX>, which takes you along
        the ancient ramparts lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">walnut trees</ENAMEX>.
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porte Sainte-Croix</ENAMEX>, there is a magnificent view
        over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cure river valley</ENAMEX> and the path that leads to the place where,
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1146</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇVII to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sec¬≠ond Crusade</ENAMEX>. This was also to be the starting point of the Third
        Crusade in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1190</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">England‚Äôs Richard</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion-Hearted</ENAMEX> joined forces
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Auguste</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V√©zelay‚Äôs Basilique Sainte-Madeleine</ENAMEX>, repository of relics
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Magdalene</ENAMEX>, is a magnificent example of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Romanesque</ENAMEX>
        architecture, in spite of the damage inflicted by natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">disaste rs</ENAMEX>,
        wars, and revolution. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">restorations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Viollet-le</ENAMEX>-Duc
        have maintained the church‚Äôs majestic harmony.
        The narthex, or entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> to the nave, is crowned by a
        magnificent sculpted tympanum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> enthroned after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resurrection</ENAMEX>, preaching his message to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apostles</ENAMEX>. On the central
        supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pillar</ENAMEX> is a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John the Baptist ‚Äî</ENAMEX> beheaded not by
        Herod but by iconoclastic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huguenot</ENAMEX> vandals.
        The nave is a wonder of light and lofty proportions,
        enhanced by the luminous beige <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> and the splendid ribbed vaulting.
        In contrast to the exalted quality of the tympanum‚Äôs sculpture, the
        robust carvings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> in the nave are lively and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">down-to-earth</ENAMEX>, making a clearly popular appeal to the throngs of
        visiting pilgrims.
        The themes depicted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> are from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> and
        the legends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>. Beside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">David</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliath</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lions‚Äô den</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Noah‚Äôs ark</ENAMEX>, one curious sculpture shows
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Eugenia</ENAMEX>, tonsured and disguised as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX>, opening her robe to
        convince a skeptical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friar</ENAMEX> that she‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.
        On the tree-shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> beyond the basilica, relax on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the benches and enjoy the splendid view looking out over the
        forested plateau of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morvan</ENAMEX>. Then explore the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">courtyards</ENAMEX> in the town‚Äôs narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> leading back down to the Place du
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Champ-de-Foire</ENAMEX>.
        Autun
        At the other end of the densely wooded Morvan plateau,
        Autun‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cath√©drale Saint-Lazare</ENAMEX> makes a natural point of
        comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V√©zelay‚Äôs Basilique Sainte-Madeleine</ENAMEX>. The Autun
        tympanum‚Äôs rich carving of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> presiding at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX> Judg¬≠ment is
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> of vitality. On the left, you see the happy few being welcomed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Peter</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imme¬≠di¬≠ately</ENAMEX> to the right of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> is the weighing of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">souls</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Michael</ENAMEX> trying to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX> from cheating. On the
        far right, a cauldron is boiling a few of the unlucky ones.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Below Jesus‚</ENAMEX>Äô feet is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> in¬≠scription that suggests
        that the tympanum was the work of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gislebertus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX>). It
        says<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">: ‚ÄúGislebertus</ENAMEX> did this. May such terror terrify those in thrall to
        earthly error, for the horror of these images tells what awaits them.
        ‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> is also believed to have carved the magnificent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cap¬≠i¬≠tals</ENAMEX> topping the pillars of the nave and aisles. Some of the more
        fragile pieces are exhibited in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs chapter room</ENAMEX>, worth a visit
        for a close-up view of his workmanship. The sculpture places a graphic
        emphasis on the ugliness of sin (the hanging of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Judas</ENAMEX>, the devil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tempting Jesus</ENAMEX>) and the simple beauty of virtue.
        At the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mus√©e Rolin</ENAMEX> there is a fine collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bur¬≠gun¬≠dian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> painting and sculpture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is partly
        housed in the elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> that belonged to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicolas</ENAMEX>
        Rolin, a wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dignitary</ENAMEX> and the benefactor of the famous H√¥tel-Dieu
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaune</ENAMEX> (see page‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ115</NUMEX>).
        Autun was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> b.c. The Porte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Andr√©</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porte</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArroux, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Th√©√¢tre Romain</ENAMEX> are some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>

        Dijon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dijon</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of art and
        architecture, of culture and learning. It is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only one hour</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGV</ENAMEX> and is the ideal gateway for a tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX> or a drive around the pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Val-Suzon</ENAMEX> to the north. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a
        good starting point for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge cruises</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal de Bourgogne</ENAMEX> (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">page‚ÄÇ45</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the city‚Äôs attractions is the shopping center
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Place Darcy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue de la Libert√©</ENAMEX>, where you can hunt for
        such regional delicacies as the famous mustards; pain d‚Äô√©pices
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gingerbread</NUMEX>); and cassis, the blackcurrant liqueur that turns an
        ordinary white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> into a deliciously refreshing kir. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> you
        many want to wait for your tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> or the wider selection
        available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaune</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dijon</ENAMEX> is a good <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for walking and exploring by

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX>. The elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th- and 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fa√ßades</ENAMEX> of the Palais
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Ducs</ENAMEX> conceal the underlying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> structures of the dukes‚Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heyday</ENAMEX>, but many of their treasures remain to be seen inside, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts</ENAMEX>.
        You get a notion of the magnificence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burgundian</ENAMEX> court
        life by starting your visit with the ducal kitchens, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1435</TIMEX>,
        which boast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> enormous walk-in cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hearths</ENAMEX>.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Fl√</ENAMEX>©malle and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dierick Bouts‚Äôs T√™te de Christ</ENAMEX>. The collection also

        Witz, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Schongauer</ENAMEX>.
        But the museum‚Äôs greatest treasures are undoubtedly the
        dukes‚Äô tombs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salle des Gardes ‚Äî</ENAMEX> brought here from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charter¬≠house of Champmol</ENAMEX>, which was destroyed during the

        mourners cloaked in monastic capes, variously praying, meditating, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lamenting</ENAMEX>. The double sepulchre of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean sans Peur</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marguerite de Bavi√®re</ENAMEX>, is also lavishly sculpted, although more

        The sign ‚ÄúGrappillage Interdit‚Äù means just what it says ‚Äî
        ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt steal the grapes,‚Äù referring even to those left hanging at the

        but tasting is strictly for serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> who show a clear
        intention to‚ÄÇbuy.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gevrey-Chambertin</ENAMEX> and the medieval
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ch√¢teau‚Äôs</ENAMEX> wine cellars make a good first stop. But the best cellars
        open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> are those in the ch√¢teau at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clos de Vougeot</ENAMEX>, owned
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cis¬≠ter¬≠cian</ENAMEX> monks until the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> and now the property of

        For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beginner ‚Äî</ENAMEX> and for most others, too ‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaune</ENAMEX> is
        the place to buy. It‚Äôs the center of the industry, and practically all

        Beaune‚Äôs best-known <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">H√¥tel-Dieu</ENAMEX>, is a

        The abbey that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> stands in ruin at the southern tip of

        The elegant classical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cloisters</ENAMEX> make a

        Brittany‚Äôs countryside is wilder and less civilized, with

        monument to mark the spot where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan</ENAMEX> was burned at the stake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1431</TIMEX>.
        Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> are some fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> stained-glass windows,
        salvaged from an older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> bombed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX>.
        Leading eastward from the market is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rouen‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous
        street, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue du Gros-Horloge ‚Äî</ENAMEX> now as always the city‚Äôs bustling
        commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Its timber-framed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th</TIMEX>, and 17th
        centuries are marvelous examples of sturdy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> architecture,
        achieving a pleasing irregularity in the way the plaster is set in
        oblique forms between the solid oak posts and collar beams supporting
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>. The elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> arched clocktower of the Gros
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horloge</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rouen‚</ENAMEX>Äôs emblem, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX>. The ornamental gilded
        clock face has only one hand, for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hours</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East of the Gros Horloge</ENAMEX> stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">great Cath√</ENAMEX>©drale
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>, made famous in modern times by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monet‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Impres¬</ENAMEX>≠sion¬≠ist
        studies of its fa√ßade. The asymmetry of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> embracing the
        delicate tracery of the slender spires creates a distinctive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silhouette</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> was constructed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several centuries</TIMEX> and
        the fa√ßade offers a remarkably harmonious anthology of Gothic
        architecture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour Saint-Romain</ENAMEX>, has the sober
        simplicity of the cathedral‚Äôs early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> beginnings in the 12th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, while the taller, more elaborate south <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour de</ENAMEX>
        Beurre, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flamboyant Gothic</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>. According to local
        belief, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> burghers subsidized this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúButter Tower‚Äù</ENAMEX> in return for
        the privilege of eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Normandy butter</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Lent</ENAMEX>. The austerely
        sculpted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX> flanking the main entrance are from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early period</TIMEX>,
        and the more ornamental elongated central porch and the gabled upper
        windows were added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th and 16th centuries</TIMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spire</ENAMEX> is
        neo-Gothic of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.
        The rather severe interior of the cathedral contrasts with
        its elaborate exterior, but the impact of the double-storied nave is
        lightened by the tall arches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapelle de la Vierge</ENAMEX>
        (beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>) is the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Tomb of the Cardinals</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amboise</ENAMEX>, with superbly sculpted allegories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> virtues.
        On the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> is the more modest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of the most
        heroic of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">medieval English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, portrayed recumbent above the
        inscription in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúHere is buried the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX>, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion-Hearted</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, cross over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue de la R√</ENAMEX>©publique
        to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eglise Saint-Maclou</ENAMEX>, the richest example of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flam¬≠boy¬≠ant Gothic</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Note the masterful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ren¬</ENAMEX>≠ais¬≠sance
        carving of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> doors on the central and north portals. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX>, the same exuberant artistry can be admired in the sculpted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX> organ frame and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> tracery of the spiral staircase.
        Turn north on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Damiette</ENAMEX>, graced by some of the town‚Äôs
        handsomest old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> leads to the elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX>
        Gothic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">abbey church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbatiale Saint-Ouen</ENAMEX>, best observed from the
        little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> east of the chancel.
        The last great monument of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue</ENAMEX> aux
        Juifs, is the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de Justice</ENAMEX>, a jewel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flamboyant Goth¬</ENAMEX>≠ic architecture built on the site of the medieval
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ghetto</ENAMEX>. Exca¬≠va¬≠tions have uncovered a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> under
        part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de Justice</ENAMEX>. This structure is currently known as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mon¬≠u¬≠ment Juif</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> debate whether it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>,
        or perhaps a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>.
        This prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, including a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-endowed Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Square Verdrel</ENAMEX>), with works by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vel√°zquez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caravaggio, Perugino, Veronese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>
        represented include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delacroix</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√ßois Clouet</ENAMEX>, as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G√©ricault</ENAMEX>, who was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rouen</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de la C√©ramique</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1‚</NUMEX>ÄÇRue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faucon</ENAMEX>) displays the local colorful glazed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">earthenware</ENAMEX> (fa√Øence) and

        Jumi√®ges
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The D982</TIMEX> leading west from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rouen</ENAMEX> is the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Abbayes</ENAMEX>, which meanders through woodland and meadows around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medieval Norman</ENAMEX> abbeys ‚Äî most of them enjoying their heyday under
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William the Conqueror</ENAMEX> ‚Äî at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin-de-Boscherville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jumi√®ges</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Wandrille</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Bec-Hellouin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caen</ENAMEX>, culminating in their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masterpiece</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Michel</ENAMEX>.
        The ruins of the huge abbey of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jumi√</ENAMEX>®ges are perhaps the
        most impressive: the white-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite shells</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman¬≠esque Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> and the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX>

        Honfleur
        Situated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX> estuary, this pretty port has
        witnessed the beginning of many seafaring adventures ‚Äî including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samuel</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Cham¬</ENAMEX>≠plain‚Äôs departure for what would become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> ‚Äî and is still a
        mecca for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Artists</ENAMEX> are also fond of this harbor and its
        constantly changing light; among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√©zanne</ENAMEX>,
        Corot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seurat</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sisley</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> still flock to Honfleur
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
        Towering over the sheltered yachting harbor of the Vieux

        shipbuilders‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Haute</ENAMEX>, is well worth exploring. It
        runs westward from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lieutenance</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> remains of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> governor‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at the harbor mouth. Among the several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honfleur</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de la Marine</ENAMEX>, with a collection of nautical

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont de Normandie</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 2‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honfleur</ENAMEX>, is an
        elegant new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> spanning the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>, and giving quick
        access to the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Havre</ENAMEX>. Completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, it shattered the

        Deauville
        Blending old-fashioned elegance with modern comforts, the
        most prosperous of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> is also the most
        expensive. But even if your budget doesn‚Äôt extend to staying in
        Deauville, take a walk along the wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> (the celebrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planches</ENAMEX>) and participate in one of the town‚Äôs favorite activities:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horse</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> come for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> racing ‚Äî flat and steeple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äî</ENAMEX> and for the prestigious yearling sale. What they win on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">racing</ENAMEX>,
        they gamble at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis and golf</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class.
        Yachts¬≠men should bear in mind a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deauville</ENAMEX> proverb: if you can see the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">port of Le Havre</ENAMEX>, it will rain <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the afternoon</TIMEX>, and if you can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs
        already raining.
        C√¥te Fleurie
        Between the estuaries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Touques and Dives rivers</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">12‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) of sandy beaches, handsome villas, and picturesquely
        ¬≠weather-beaten old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> give a nostalgic peek at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇIII‚Äôs
        Second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belle Epoque</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1900s</TIMEX>.
        The oldest of this coast‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trouville</ENAMEX>, is now a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>, and bistros on the port serve excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood</ENAMEX>.
        The charm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houlgate</ENAMEX> is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX> and its sandy beach. Take the long walk at low tide east to the

        Pays d‚ÄôAuge
        Inland from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te Fleurie</ENAMEX> the countryside reflects the
        popular image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy</ENAMEX>: orchards, rolling valleys, and massive
        timbered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor houses</ENAMEX>, the land where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> are turned into cider and
        Calvados, and dairies churn out pungent, creamy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Camem¬≠bert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Livarot</ENAMEX>,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camembert, Pont</ENAMEX>-l‚ÄôEv√™que, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Livarot</ENAMEX> themselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Drivers</ENAMEX> should be
        wary of the strong cider.
        Caen
        Little remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caen‚</ENAMEX>Äôs historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, but its good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood restaurants</ENAMEX> make it, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayeux</ENAMEX>, a useful
        starting-point for visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Normandy</ENAMEX> invasion beaches. Caen was a
        major objective of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> landings. It took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX>

        Fortunately, the noble silhouette of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbaye</ENAMEX> aux Hommes

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medieval</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue Saint-Martin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Saint-Malo</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Bourbesneur</ENAMEX>.
        But the town‚Äôs most cherished treasure is the magnificent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayeux Tapestry</ENAMEX> (or more accurately, embroidery), which was created for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bayeux Cathedral</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1077</TIMEX> to tell the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke William‚</ENAMEX>Äôs conquest
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. It is lovingly mounted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Guillaume-le-Conqu√©rant</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue de Nesmond</ENAMEX>, and is accompanied by a
        fascinating film (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>) that explains the work‚Äôs
        historical background.
        No dreary piece of obscure medieval decoration, the
        beautifully colored tapestry gives a vivid and often humorous picture
        of life at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, with insights into medieval cooking,
        lovemaking, and the careful preparations for war. These and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">climactic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hastings</ENAMEX> are depicted with all the exciting action
        and violence of a modern adventure film, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> of

        D-Day Beaches
        Before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6‚</NUMEX>ÄÇJune <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1944</TIMEX> the peaceful stretch of coast west of
        Cabourg, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ouistreham</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cotentin</ENAMEX> peninsula, was known simply as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te du Calvados</ENAMEX>, a flat, undramatic shoreline broken by a few
        unspectacular chalk cliffs and sand dunes. And then, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30am</TIMEX> on
        D<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-Day</TIMEX>, came the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of a fleet of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,266</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> to turn the beaches
        into beachheads with their now famous code names: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sword</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juno</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> will find an atmosphere of rather bleak
        serenity that is in itself as evocative as the remaining concrete
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bunkers</ENAMEX> and blockhouses, some simple monuments on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of the
        action, and the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of crosses in the military cemeteries.
        To see where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX>, with the support
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Free French forces</ENAMEX>, attacked on the eastern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the beaches,
        start out at the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ouistreham-Riva-Bella</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place Alfred-Thomas</ENAMEX>, details the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> to
        capture this stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sword Beach</ENAMEX>, with uniforms and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> used
        during the action, including a pocket <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliath</ENAMEX> tank.
        Drive west along the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">D514</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berni√®res</ENAMEX> and Courseulles
        (where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> staged their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juno Beach</ENAMEX> landings, marked by
        monuments on the beaches), and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canadians‚Äô cemetery 4‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇkm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">21‚ÅÑ2‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) to the south at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reviers</ENAMEX>.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arromanches</ENAMEX>, you can see the most fascinating monument
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> ingenuity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> landings ‚Äî the remains of an
        artificial harbor. The floating steel-and-concrete jetties and
        pontoons, hauled across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English Channel</ENAMEX>, were the only way of
        unloading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> and heavy artillery on a coastline (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gold Beach</ENAMEX>) without
        natural harbors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e du D√</ENAMEX>©barquement on the seafront includes an
        exciting film explaining the whole heroic action.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Americans‚Äô Omaha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> beaches, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colleville</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine</ENAMEX>, are now official map references, a cartographer‚Äôs tribute
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> of the fiercest fighting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-Day landings. The
        windswept, desolate coastline frequently recalls the stormy conditions
        that prevented the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> from setting up their own artificial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harbor</ENAMEX> to land their equipment. More eloquent than any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,386</NUMEX> white marble crosses of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> on a cliff
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">overlooking Omaha Beach</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colleville-Saint-Laurent</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah Beach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and monument are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>)

        and to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemeteries</ENAMEX> in the region.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mont-Saint-Michel</ENAMEX>
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island sanctuary</ENAMEX> at the border between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brittany</ENAMEX> is truly a merveille de l‚<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ÄôOccident ‚Äî a ‚ÄúWonder</ENAMEX> of the Western
        World. ‚Äù That first glimpse of the towering, steepled abbey rising from
        the sea on its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> is a moment you will not forget.
        Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> can be
        overwhelming, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> prefer to admire it from a distance.
        The view of the illuminated mont at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> is spectacular from the other
        side of the bay. If you do decide to go in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, start early in the
        day.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bay</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mount‚Äôs granite outcrop</ENAMEX> has been
        steadily silting up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, so that it‚Äôs an island only during
        very high tides. These are most dramatic during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>
        equinox, when the sea comes in at a rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 50‚</NUMEX>ÄÇm (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">164‚ÄÇft</ENAMEX>) a
        minute over a distance of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>). This proved highly dangerous
        to pilgrims who approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">abbey</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> (the causeway
        joining the island to the mainland was not built until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874</TIMEX>).
        On what was once a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Celtic</ENAMEX> burial ground (originally named
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mont-Tombe</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> of the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avranches</ENAMEX> began by
        building an oratory in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX> ‚Äî at the prompting, he
        claimed, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archangel Michael</ENAMEX>. Then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1017</TIMEX> Benedictine monks
        started work on the flat-roofed abbey you can see in the Bayeux
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tapestry</ENAMEX>, propped up on a platform with blocks of brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> brought
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel</ENAMEX> islands of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Chausey 40‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">25‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) away.
        By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>, the abbey was surrounded by a
        fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX> flocked here throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hundred</ENAMEX>
        Years‚<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Äô War</ENAMEX>, paying tolls to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, who controlled the surrounding
        territory ‚Äî though they never succeeded in breaking through the mount‚Äôs
        defenses. After a period of steady decline, the monaster y was
        dismantled even before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>. It was saved from total
        destruction only to end up, ignominiously, as a state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>.
        Beginning on the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> with a splendid view of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bay</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour-long</TIMEX> guided tour (conducted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>) takes you through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three</TIMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">abbey buildings</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>,
        cloister, and refectory at the top; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salle des Chevaliers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights‚</ENAMEX>Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salle des H√¥tes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Guests‚Äô Hall</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle</TIMEX>; and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">storeroom</ENAMEX> and almonry underneath.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">abbey church</ENAMEX> combines a sturdy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> nave with a
        markedly lighter and more airy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flamboyant Gothic</ENAMEX> chancel. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chancel</ENAMEX> do not stand on the island‚Äôs granite core but on a platform
        formed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> crypts, with the massive columns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crypte des Gros</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piliers</ENAMEX> doing most of the work.
        In a magical space looking out over the sea, the
        beautifully sculpted columns of the cloister create a perfect framework
        of grace and delicacy for a moment‚Äôs meditation. With the cloister, the
        monks‚Äô ethereally lit refectory, the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Knights‚Äô Hall</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">elegant Guests‚Äô Hall</ENAMEX> together make up the masterpiece of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> architecture that earned the abbey its name of la‚ÄÇMerveille.
        Future access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has been the subject of lively
        debate ‚Äî with suggestions of replacing the causeway with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> or
        with boat service. And there have been proposals to control sales of
        fast food and souvenirs.
        Brittany
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brittany</ENAMEX>, as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> will tell you, is
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> apart, proud of its regional culture and guarding its
        seclusion from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.
        The sea beckons many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX>, with a
        combination of a craggy coastline and great sandy beaches, seaside

        the north and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Malo</ENAMEX>, a town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">steeped</ENAMEX> in seafaring history; its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sailors</ENAMEX> left their name as far afield as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malouines</ENAMEX>, claimed by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falkland Islands</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Malo</ENAMEX> remains an important

        Like many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seaside resorts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dinard</ENAMEX> was a ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù

        neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>.
        In a morning‚Äôs tour from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mor¬≠laix</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 160‚</NUMEX>ÄÇkm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dinard</ENAMEX>, you can take in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the most
        important ones on a route signposted as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúCircuit des</ENAMEX> Enclos
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paroissiaux</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Th√</ENAMEX>©gonnec is an outstanding example, its triumphal
        arch setting the tone for the majestic calvary of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1610</TIMEX>. Among the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-odd expressively sculpted figures dressed in the costume of
        Henri‚ÄÇIV‚Äôs time, notice the roped hands of the blindfolded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> and
        the angels collecting his blood; his tormentor, in breeches, is thought
        to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri IV</ENAMEX> himself. The ossuary, now a chapel, is late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>
        in the very elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Breton manner ‚Äî with Corinthian columns</ENAMEX>,
        lanterns, niches, and caryatids. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has an even more elaborate
        Baroque pulpit.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Testament</ENAMEX> figures are sculpted
        on the calvary at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guimiliau</ENAMEX>. The elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> style lends an
        unaccustomed sophistication to the nightmarish superstitions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medieval Brittany</ENAMEX> incorporated in the sculpture. Look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl hurtled</ENAMEX> into hell for flirting with the devil. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has
        granite statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Apostles</ENAMEX> adorning its porch. Inside,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> spiral columns support the canopy of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> carved oak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baptistry</ENAMEX>.
        Although a lightning bolt toppled the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of the church
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lampaul-Guimiliau</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1809</TIMEX>, the church‚Äôs interior remains impressive.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 16th-century</TIMEX> polychrome rood <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> spanning the nave is decorated
        with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12‚ÄÇprophetesses</NUMEX> (on the chancel side) and scenes from the
        Passion.
        Huelgoat
        This pretty little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is mainly attractive as a base for
        excursions into the nature reserve of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, rivers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parc R√</ENAMEX>©gional d‚ÄôArmorique. You can fish for perch and carp in the lake
        or for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rivi√®re d‚ÄôArgent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silver River</ENAMEX>), or just glide
        around the lake among the swans. At the top end of the lake, you wander
        into dense forest through a fantastic chaos of rocks and grottos that
        according to local tradition are variously inhabited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devil</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Arthur</ENAMEX> himself.
        Carnac
        Like the wild countryside of the interior, the megalithic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monuments of Brittany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs menhir <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> on the south coast take you back
        into the legends and mists of time.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnac</ENAMEX> is surrounded by fields with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of gigantic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> (menhirs) arranged in mysterious alignments and patterns set up
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 5500‚ÄÇb</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c. Scholars</ENAMEX> have suggested
        that the alignments are associated with cults of the sun or moon, or
        are astronomical arrangements for predicting such phenomena as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eclipses</ENAMEX>.
        The alignments occupy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> a short walk north
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le M√©nec</ENAMEX>, the biggest, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,099‚</NUMEX>ÄÇmenhirs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12‚ÄÇrows</TIMEX> (plus
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70‚</NUMEX>ÄÇmenhirs in a circle or cromlech around part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of Le
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©nec</ENAMEX>). The field of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kermario</ENAMEX> has a dolmen (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> built of flat slabs
        on pillars) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,029‚ÄÇmenhirs</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10‚ÄÇrows</NUMEX>. Among them is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> of
        Manio, a menhir over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6‚ÄÇm</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">20‚ÄÇft</ENAMEX>) high, shaped like a clenched fist.
        Most impressive is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerlescan</ENAMEX> alignment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">594</NUMEX> menhirs that form what
        local legend calls a frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>. The best time to see them all is
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, looming out of the mist, or at sunset, throwing dramatic
        shadows.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de la Pr√©histoire</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place de la Chapelle</ENAMEX>)

        Neolithic, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronze</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iron</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ages.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Baule</ENAMEX>
        The best beach in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> ‚Äî at least that‚Äôs the verdict of
        its regulars. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Five‚ÄÇkm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">three‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pornichet</ENAMEX> to Le

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clubs</ENAMEX>, along an esplanade of luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>.
        If you tire of the easy life on the beachfront, take a
        trip west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Baule</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">wilder</ENAMEX> coast of the peninsula past
        Batz-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sur-Mer</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bah</ENAMEX>) to the pretty little fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire Valley</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire</ENAMEX> is the longest river in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> ‚Äî flowing an
        impressive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,010‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">630‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) from its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> in the Vivarais
        mountains south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Etienne</ENAMEX> to its estuary west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nantes</ENAMEX> ‚Äî but
        the region of the most interesting ch√¢teaux, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chambord</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angers</ENAMEX>,
        covers barely a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of that distance.
        The route we propose for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> driving from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bypasses Orl√</ENAMEX>©ans on the autoroute, exits at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blois</ENAMEX> and, after a side
        trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chambord</ENAMEX>, heads west on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N152</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angers</ENAMEX>. Just reverse the
        route if you‚Äôre coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brittany</ENAMEX>.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Loire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> was a vital highway between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> and the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. Commercial traffic declined
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th and 18th centuries</TIMEX>, revived briefly with the advent of
        the steamship in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1832</TIMEX>, then succumbed to silting and the onslaught of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>. Today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire</ENAMEX> is a sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX>, running deep only
        with heavy rains or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring thaws</TIMEX>, and its sandbanks and mud flats
        become islands during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.
        Blois
        Situated on a hill overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself
        invites the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to linger in the narrow winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that lead
        from the cathedral to the ch√¢teau, pausing to admire the handsome old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">houses on the Place Saint-Louis and the Rue Porte-Chartraine</ENAMEX>.
        The royal ch√¢teau of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blois</ENAMEX> is interesting for its variety
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">styles ‚Äî</ENAMEX> ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th</TIMEX> to 17th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> ‚Äî built around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. The entrance to the ch√¢teau is through the
        brick-and-stone gateway of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇXII <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, completed in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1503</TIMEX>. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> on the right-hand side is the ch√¢teau‚Äôs most
        distinctive feature, the splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√</ENAMEX>ßois‚ÄÇI <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>. It was built only a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dozen</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇXII <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> but, reflecting the contrast
        between the debonair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ren¬</ENAMEX>≠ais¬≠sance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> and his dour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX>, is
        a world apart in elegance and panache.
        The open loggias of its magnificently sculpted octagonal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> stair¬≠case dominate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fa¬≠√ßade</ENAMEX>. They served as a kind of
        grandstand for courtiers watching important personages arriving on
        state occasions. The little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> carved on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">¬≠elsewhere</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ch√¢¬≠teau</ENAMEX> are the royal family‚Äôs personal em¬≠blems
        ‚Äî including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XII‚</ENAMEX>Äôs porcupine, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fran¬≠√ßois‚ÄÇI‚Äôs</ENAMEX> salamander, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anne</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">de Bre¬≠tagne‚Äôs</ENAMEX> ermine.
        Of particular interest on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor of the
        Fran√ßois‚ÄÇI <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> is the wood-paneled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> (study) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M√©dicis</ENAMEX>, conniving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen mother</ENAMEX> and regent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.
        Many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">237‚</NUMEX>ÄÇcarved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>, each different, were believed to conceal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poisons</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX>. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1588</TIMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri‚ÄÇIII</ENAMEX> used not poison but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> armed with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">swords</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">daggers</ENAMEX> to do away with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">archrival</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri de</ENAMEX>
        Guise.
        Chambord
        Upriver, east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blois</ENAMEX>, in a huge densely wooded park
        surrounded by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">20‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) of high walls, the brilliant white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ch√¢teau de Cham¬≠¬≠bord</ENAMEX> is the most extravagant of all the royal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residences</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loire Valley</ENAMEX>. To have easy access to the wild boar
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> (which can still be seen from observation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√ßois‚ÄÇI</ENAMEX> built himself this glorified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">440</NUMEX>-room hunting lodge.
        Construction began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1519</TIMEX> and was largely finished by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1547</TIMEX>.
        Apart from its sheer size, the roofline is the most
        striking aspect of the ch√¢teau ‚Äî a surprisingly harmonious blend of
        cupolas, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>, turrets, spires, and chimneys. It is believed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX>, whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√ßois</ENAMEX> brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loire Valley</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1516</TIMEX>,
        participated in the design, especially of the central <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-towered
        donjon ‚Äî which makes a dream <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> out of a classically feudal castle
        keep ‚Äî and the celebrated double-ramped spiral staircase in the
        donjon‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, which enables <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to go up and down without
        meeting.
        The interior is sparsely furnished.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blois</ENAMEX>, follow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N152</TIMEX> along the right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the
        Loire before crossing over to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amboise</ENAMEX> for a brief look at the exterior
        of the ch√¢teau that housed many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>. Although a large
        part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ch√¢teau complex</ENAMEX> is no longer standing, it remains an
        impressive site. An unusual feature is the huge spiral ramp of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tour</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Minimes</ENAMEX>, wide enough to allow access for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and provisions.
        Some of the interior has been refurbished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> and there is
        a collection of interesting furniture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX> spent his last
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor house</ENAMEX> nearby, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clos-Luc√©</ENAMEX>, now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        illustrating his talents. A bust in the ch√¢teau gardens marks the site
        of his grave. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chenonceaux</ENAMEX> (unlike the ch√¢teau, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is spelt with
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúx‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is on the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amboise</ENAMEX> forest.
        Chenonceau
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> ch√¢teaux, Chenonceau
        and its famous <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> are raised on arches to span the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cher</ENAMEX>
        river. The ch√¢teau was owned by a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> including the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beautiful Diane de Poitiers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri II</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√©dicis.</ENAMEX>
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, in addition to fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX>
        Flemish tapestries and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> furniture, you‚Äôll
        see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane‚Äôs</ENAMEX> neatly kept household accounts. No one knows whether
        Prima¬≠ticcio‚Äôs vivid contemporary portrait of her as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>, the goddess
        of hunting, does full justice to her beauty.
        After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henri‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine de M√©dicis</ENAMEX>, took
        Chenonceau for herself and added the galleried <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of ballrooms and
        reception <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> that complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> across the river.
        Tours of the ch√¢teau are self-guided and there are
        impressive formal gardens and a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Boat rides are available on
        the river when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is deep enough.
        Loches
        To the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chenonceaux</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indre river</ENAMEX>, the
        medieval village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loches</ENAMEX> is as much an attraction as the ch√¢teau
        itself. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collegiate Church of Saint-Ours</ENAMEX> is an interesting piece of
        Roman¬≠esque architecture: it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">steeples</ENAMEX> at either end of the
        nave, which is surmounted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">octagonal pyramids</ENAMEX> in place of a roof.
        In the interior, the narthex, or entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, has some fine, although
        partially mutilated, sculptures. Over the nave, the two hollow pyramids
        appear to be designed in the style of chimneys for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.
        Stroll along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rue Saint-Ours</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue du Ch√¢teau</ENAMEX>,
        then wander around the ramparts. Particularly interesting is the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">donjon</ENAMEX> (keep) that formed part of the town‚Äôs southern
        defenses. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two 15th-century</TIMEX> additions served as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> for royal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>.
        At the other end of the fortifications, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logis Royal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Lodge</ENAMEX>) affords a delightful view over the village
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indre Valley</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Architecturally</ENAMEX>, the lodge offers an interesting
        transition from sober <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> to more decorative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>. An
        interesting feature is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne de Bretagne‚</ENAMEX>Äôs private oratory, built around
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> and a masterpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flamboyant Gothic</ENAMEX> style.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Azay-le</ENAMEX>-Rideau
        With walls of dazzling white stone beneath gray slate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">roofs</ENAMEX>, the picturesque ch√¢teau at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azay</ENAMEX> reflects the waters of the Indre
        river, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">19‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tours</ENAMEX>.
        It was erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 16th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√</ENAMEX>ßois‚ÄÇI‚Äôs
        corrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilles Berthelot</ENAMEX> ‚Äî part of it on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX>-style
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> of timber piles close-driven into the bed of the river.
        Berthelot‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> supervised the design, and the delicacy of its forms,
        especially the slender conical turrets at each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX> and the
        double-arched loggias of the main staircase, are the result. The moats
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">turrets ‚Äî</ENAMEX> though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> in style ‚Äî are purely decorative, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staircase</ENAMEX> is noted for its innovative straight flights and landings
        rather than the old spiral form that was designed to fend off
        invaders.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madame Berthelot</ENAMEX> had the large vaulted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> built
        almost on a level with the river, so that an indoor well provided the
        closest thing to running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and an unusually hygienic stone drain
        sent back the slops. You can see the kind of utensils and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> tins her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> would have used ‚Äî at least, until the ch√¢teau was confiscated by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berthelot‚</ENAMEX>Äôs misdeeds.
        There is a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son et lumi√</ENAMEX>®re on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> evenings.
        Saumur
        Heading west from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Azay-le-Rideau</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angers</ENAMEX>, you cannot
        miss the towering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√¢teau de Saumur</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is also known for its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sparkling</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and for the caves where <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 70‚ÄÇper¬≠cent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX> are grown. The fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e du Cham¬</ENAMEX>≠pignon
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Hilaire Saint Florent</ENAMEX>) explains the whole process and displays
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fossils</ENAMEX> found in the caves as well as a troglo¬≠dyte <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">family‚Äôs home</ENAMEX>.
        Angers
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anjou</ENAMEX> is a perfect base for exploring
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loire Valley</ENAMEX> from its western end; this bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> town
        offers first-class modern shopping in the pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place du Ralliement</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angers</ENAMEX> is considered one of the most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and is home to many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of interest and musuems, including
        the imposing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th- and 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic Cath√©drale Saint-Maurice</ENAMEX>. If
        not the most beautiful, the ch√¢teau is certainly the most formidable in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loire Valley</ENAMEX>, a real defensive fortress, its black ramparts still
        forbidding despite having had their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers decapitated</ENAMEX> on the orders of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri III</ENAMEX>. The ch√¢teau‚Äôs proudest possession is the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apocalypse Tapestry</ENAMEX> narrating the gospel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint John</ENAMEX> in moving
        detail. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX> pieces of this remarkable work survive out of an

        The beautifully restored ruins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eglise</ENAMEX> Toussaint
        (dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>) have been incorporated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gal√</ENAMEX>©rie
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David d‚ÄôAngers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Toussaint</ENAMEX>), which houses a unique collection of

        Gutenberg, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paganini</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX> (here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angers</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll see a
        plaster bust, the bronze of which stands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOUTHEAST</ENAMEX>
        The southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> down through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rh√¥ne Val¬</ENAMEX>≠ley to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAzur (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rivi¬≠era</ENAMEX>), is
        France‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> that cater to tourists‚Äô needs in both
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. Wheth¬≠er you prefer lying on a beach, leisurely
        strolls, or more energetic activities, you will find what you want
        here.
        The outdoor life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Savoie Alps</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> around
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest mountain) can be as exhilarating
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> as in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. Though less energetic, life is equally
        refreshing down on the lovely lakes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annecy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Bourget</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rh√¥ne Valley</ENAMEX> region around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> is the epicenter of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> gastronomy.
        And further south, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pro¬≠vence</ENAMEX>, the climate and the slow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Medi¬≠¬≠ter¬≠¬≠ra¬≠¬≠nean</ENAMEX> lifestyle take charge. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins and
        feudal fortresses to explore, but you will also want to do some serious
        lounging under shady <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX>.
        We also suggest a small selection of holiday resorts and
        excursions on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> wild and beautiful island of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX>.
        Savoie
        The once-remote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoie</ENAMEX>, long an independent
        duchy, voted to become a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> had little
        interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> until the mountain-climbing craze was launched by
        the conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1786</TIMEX>. But it wasn‚Äôt until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX>, with the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Olympic Games</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamonix</ENAMEX>, that skiing ‚Äî at the time only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-country ‚Äî attracted international attention. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the slopes are
        packed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and some of the newer resorts lack the charm of the
        traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, but the scenery remains unbeatable.
        However, the high mountains, lakes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoie</ENAMEX> are
        not just for skiiers. Vast fields of wildflowers welcome the spring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visitor</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> horseback riding, mountain biking, tennis,
        rafting, hang-gliding, and paragliding now join the more traditional
        activities of climbing and hiking.
        Even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, you should keep a sweater and sunglasses
        with you ‚Äî for sudden changes in temperature and for the brilliant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sunlight</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also important to take the rarefied atmosphere into
        account when exercising.
        Chamonix
        The neighborhood around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has enough
        old-fashioned charm to retain something of the town‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX>
        pioneering atmosphere. For a fuller sense of what it was like when
        mountain-climbing and skiing were in their infancy, spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> or so
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Alpin</ENAMEX>, tracing the history of the region, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>, and
        their exploits, in photos and displays of equipment.
        The cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">t√©l√©ph√©rique</ENAMEX>) ride up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aiguille du</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midi</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,840‚ÄÇm/12,470‚ÄÇft</NUMEX>) is the most spectacular in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>,
        offering a breathtaking view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont Blanc‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX>-covered peak,
        altitude <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,800‚ÄÇm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15,770‚ÄÇft</NUMEX>), and the surrounding landscape. For some
        easy hiking, stop off at the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> of Plan de l‚ÄôAiguille
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,310‚ÄÇm/7,580‚ÄÇft</NUMEX>). The cable car up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Br√©vent</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,525 m/8,284‚ÄÇft</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwest of Chamonix</ENAMEX>, will give you a panoramic view of the whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">north</ENAMEX> face of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aiguille du Midi</ENAMEX>. For a close-up view
        of a glacier and formidable ice caves, take the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and rack
        railway up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montenvers</ENAMEX> to the dazzling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mer de Glace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ice</ENAMEX>).
        Meg√®ve
        This perennially fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> is particularly
        popular for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> skiing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> are ideal for
        intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> are able to pay special attention
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, in addition to superb <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> and swimming, the town‚Äôs setting among grassy alpine meadows and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pine</ENAMEX>, spruce, and larch forest is perfect for hikes. A cable car takes
        you to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArbois (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,833‚ÄÇm/6,014‚ÄÇft</NUMEX>) for a great view of the Aravis
        peaks and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hikers</ENAMEX> then continue to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont Joly</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5‚</NUMEX>ÄÇhours
        to and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArbois cable-car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>) for an even more
        spectacular view.
        Annecy
        The old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annecy</ENAMEX> would be picture-perfect even
        without the addition of a river running through it ‚Äî complete with
        swans, a pristine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine</ENAMEX> lake alongside, and a backdrop of snowcapped
        mountains.
        Strolling along the waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">promenades</ENAMEX> and through the
        narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and taking boat trips on the lake are the main
        attractions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the major sights is the much-photographed,
        triangular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palais de l‚ÄôIsle</ENAMEX>, which stands in the middle of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thiou</ENAMEX> river like the prow of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has filled many
        roles over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> to jail to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mint</ENAMEX>, and is now used
        for exhibitions.
        The imposing ch√¢teau ‚Äî former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the Counts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX>
        ‚Äî contains an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> devoted to local archaeology and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">folklore</ENAMEX> and the natural history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ch√¢teau‚Äôs terrace</ENAMEX> is
        the best vantage point for pictures of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruises</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Annecy</ENAMEX> start from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thiou</ENAMEX> river.
        Some of them include a cable-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> ride to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX> Veyrier
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,291‚ÄÇm/4,230‚ÄÇft</NUMEX>) and its spectacular panorama of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>, but all
        will give you a wonderful view of the jagged snowcapped peaks of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dents de Lanfon</ENAMEX> and the rugged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Tournette</ENAMEX> to the east, and the

        As a sidetrip, take the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">D909</NUMEX> east to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont</ENAMEX> Veyrier
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, continuing on to the pretty town of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menthon-Saint-Bernard</ENAMEX>
        and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval castle</ENAMEX> high above the lake. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">D42</NUMEX> takes you up to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Col de la Forclaz</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,157‚ÄÇm/3,800‚ÄÇft</NUMEX>).
        Aix-les-Bains
        This elegant spa <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lac du</ENAMEX> Bourget
        has offered cures for rheumatism and other ailments for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. The

        Lamartine, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Sa√´ns</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rachmaninov</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> national health system has
        approved reimbursement for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> treatments and the number of curistes
        seeking treatment has risen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aix</ENAMEX> is extending its thermal facilities
        and is enhancing its waterfront. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swimming</ENAMEX>, waterskiing, windsurfing,
        and sailing are all available on the lake as are boat cruises. One
        popular cruise destination (leaving from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Port</ENAMEX>) is to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neo-Gothic Abbaye de Hautecombe</ENAMEX>.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rh√¥ne Valley</ENAMEX>
        From its source high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rh√¥ne</ENAMEX> flows
        almost due south to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rh√¥ne Valley</ENAMEX> has always been
        a central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX>, road, and rail traffic between
        the north and the south. It was the main path of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romans‚Äô</ENAMEX> invasion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul</ENAMEX>, and the key to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs commercial wealth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>
        Ages.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> region benefit from a subtle
        mixture of the cooler and damper north with the first hints of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Medi¬≠ter¬≠ra¬≠ne¬≠an warmth</ENAMEX> and light. Some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in the

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> industry started in earnest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX> as a
        reaction to the phylloxera disease that struck the local <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>.
        Today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beau¬</ENAMEX>≠jolais <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> thrives and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> heading south

        Located at the crossroads <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between</NUMEX> north and south, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX>
        was the ideal choice as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul</ENAMEX>. The silk trade

        good life, an important cultural heritage, and a lively contemporary
        arts scene.
        Food is an important part of any visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX>; superchef
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Bocuse</ENAMEX> is based here and has many local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>. In addition to the
        great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haute cuisine</ENAMEX> in and around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, you should seek
        out the little bars and caf√©s and the old-fashioned bistros that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lyonnais</ENAMEX> call bouchons (after the bunches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX> or foliage that
        served as a sign for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>).
        It‚Äôs not easy to find your way around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is
        built across the looping confluence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa√¥ne</ENAMEX> (rhymes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rh√¥ne</ENAMEX>)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rh√¥ne</ENAMEX> rivers, with hills on either side and a peninsula in the
        middle. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> map is a must.
        So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> first for the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> on the huge Place
        Bellecour, in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presqu‚Äôile</ENAMEX>, the peninsula between the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rivers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> has a pretty flower market, and you know you‚Äôre
        approaching the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> when you see your first serious games
        of boules here.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont Bona¬</ENAMEX>≠parte to view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cath√</ENAMEX>©drale
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Jean</ENAMEX> and its astronomical clock and then stroll around the fine
        Ren¬≠ais¬≠sance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs old town between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa√¥ne</ENAMEX> river and the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Georges, Rue Saint-Jean, Rue du Boeuf</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Juiverie</ENAMEX>. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">handsome H√¥tel de Gadagne</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue du Boeuf</ENAMEX>), there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">celebrated Guignol</ENAMEX> theater. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is undergoing restoration that
        will <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last until 2004</TIMEX> but the exhibits are expected to remain open.
        Further west, off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue de l‚ÄôAntiquaille</ENAMEX>, are two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">important Roman</ENAMEX> amphitheaters that are still used for performances
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and the attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mus√©e de la Civilisation Gallo-Romaine</ENAMEX> (corner
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Cl√©berg</ENAMEX>), which houses a collection of statues, mosaics,
        coins, and tools.
        Towering over the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is the elaborate
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Basilique Notre-Dame-de-Fourvi√®re</ENAMEX>, which boasts <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towers</ENAMEX> and various adornments. Take the funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place Saint-Jean</ENAMEX> up to the top of the hill and walk down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemin du</ENAMEX>
        Rosaire, which gives spectacular views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> below.
        All of this will work up an appetite, easily satisfied in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and caf√©s of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presqu‚Äô√Æle</ENAMEX>, or perhaps
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> market on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quai des C√©lestins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quai Saint Antoine</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shoppers</ENAMEX> will want to visit the lively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue de la</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R√©publique</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place des Jacobins</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyon</ENAMEX> has a wealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, among which the following
        are certainly worth a visit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts</ENAMEX>, finely housed in

        Provence
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> approach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX> from the north; the warmth
        of the sun, the red-tiled roofs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress trees</ENAMEX>, the garrigue
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">scrubland</NUMEX>), and the fragrance of lavender alert you that you have
        arrived. Apart from the flat, well-populated coastal area, much of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX>, with small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> that seem unchanged by
        the passage of time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> dressed in black chat outside their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>;
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> gather in shady squares to discuss the day‚Äôs news and play
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">p√©tanque</ENAMEX>, or‚ÄÇboules.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX> has been popular for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>; the monuments of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> still stand proudly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arles</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N√Æmes</ENAMEX>, as do
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval strongholds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Baux</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avignon</ENAMEX>. But the most
        important pleasure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX> is not the sightseeing but the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX>-soaked landscape, the leisurely pace of life, and the wonderful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cuisine</ENAMEX>.
        Along the coast Provence bristles with cultural activity
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> using its ancient amphitheater,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> as a magnificent setting for festivals of music,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theater</ENAMEX>, and the other arts (see page‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ196</NUMEX>).
        The itinerary we propose deals in turn with the various
        layers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proven√</ENAMEX>ßal life: the ‚ÄúRoman‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaison, N√Æmes</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arles</ENAMEX>; the medieval bastions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Baux</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Avignon</ENAMEX>; the ancient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lub√©ron mountains</ENAMEX>; and finally the cheerful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of
        Aix-en-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Provence</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orange</ENAMEX>
        Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Orange</ENAMEX> is the gateway to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Provence</ENAMEX>, make an
        appropriate entrance into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from the north, at the imposing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-arched arc de triomphe. Erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 21</TIMEX>, it stands on a
        traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> across the old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">N7</ENAMEX>, which here traces the route of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancient Via Agrippa</ENAMEX>. The friezes on the northern side, depicting battle
        scenes, weaponry, and naval equipment, celebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        victories over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gallic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of the region and the merchant fleet
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marseilles</ENAMEX>.
        The town‚Äôs other great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> monument, the th√©√¢tre
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antique</ENAMEX>, is on the south side of town. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">His¬≠to¬≠rians</ENAMEX> regard this as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">finest</ENAMEX> and best preserved of all the surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, unique for its towering scenic wall, with a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Em¬</ENAMEX>≠per¬≠or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustus</ENAMEX> to greet you. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 7,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> would
        gather here to watch a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> tragedy, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> comedy, or lottery
        draw. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> still provides a wonderful setting for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
        festival‚Äôs opera and symphony concerts. From the top of the Colline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Eutrope</ENAMEX>, you get a good bird‚Äôs-eye view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> in
        relation to the triumphal arch and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rh√¥ne Valley</ENAMEX> beyond.
        Vaison-la-Romaine
        A pleasant drive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30‚</NUMEX>ÄÇkm (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">19‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orange</ENAMEX>
        along the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">D975</NUMEX> takes you to the site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Provence</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">river Ouv√®ze</ENAMEX>, spanned by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>,
        separates the attractive medieval haute ville from the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins. To gain a better understanding of the layout of the
        ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, fountains, and theater, visit
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puymin</ENAMEX> hill. It displays some superb marble
        sculptures of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> a.d. , most notably a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Hadrian</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sabina</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont du</ENAMEX> Gard
        Take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the A9</TIMEX> autoroute southwest from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fourn√®s-Remoulins</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX>, then follow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D981</TIMEX> to this gigantic
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX>, without doubt the most impressive of all the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman mon¬≠u¬≠ments</ENAMEX> preserved from an¬≠cient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul</ENAMEX>. It carried <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> water
        from near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uz√</ENAMEX>©s to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N√Æmes</ENAMEX>, a distance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35‚</NUMEX>ÄÇkm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">22‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>).
        Built of enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> blocks joined without mortar in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tiers of arches, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> at the base, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> at the middle level, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> at
        the top, this highly functional construction is also remarkably
        beautiful, in total harmony with its landscape. The best view is from
        the riverbank near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ch√¢teau Saint-Privat</ENAMEX>, beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX>.
        N√Æmes
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustus</ENAMEX> made a gift of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> of his victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>,
        commemorated to this day in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N√Æmes</ENAMEX> coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> with the chained
        crocodile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX>. The grand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> amphitheater (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ar√®nes</ENAMEX>) was built
        for gladiator battles and held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX>. It has
        since served as the site of combats between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>, as a
        fortress for the invading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Visigoths</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX>, as a communal
        residence for the poor in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is the site of a
        variety of events including bullfights.
        The more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">pacific Greek</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> known as the Maison
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr√©e</ENAMEX>, an elegant monument dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> b.c. , is
        noted for the finely sculpted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Corinthian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> on its columns. After
        a varied history as town hall, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, stable, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, it was
        saved from plans devised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colbert</ENAMEX> to move it
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX>-by-stone to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it houses a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">small‚ÄÇmuseum¬≠</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carr√</ENAMEX>© d‚ÄôArt, an ultramodern building opposite the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison Carr√©e</ENAMEX>, exhibits modern art. The rooftop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> offers a
        good view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Arch√©ologique</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 bis</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amiral Courbet</ENAMEX>), housed in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jesuit</ENAMEX> college, has an
        important collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> glass.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardin de la Fontaine</ENAMEX> ‚Äî a pretty, tree-shaded
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on the slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mont Cavalier</ENAMEX> at the northwest edge
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> ‚Äî offers a refreshing respite from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> heat and a
        good view of the surrounding mountains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is built around the
        spring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nemausus</ENAMEX>, which gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> its name; it includes a ruined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> attributed to the hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana</ENAMEX>, and the octagonal Tour
        Magne, once part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> walls.
        Arles
        An important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Gaul</ENAMEX>, replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX> as capital
        toward the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arles</ENAMEX> boasts a very well-preserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">amphi¬≠theater</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ar√®nes</ENAMEX>), seating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gladiators</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is the site of bullfights. For the most
        spectacular view, climb up to the broad path that runs along the roof
        of the arches on its‚ÄÇperimeter.
        Less lucky than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orange</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> theater
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">th√©√¢tre antique</ENAMEX>) has been reduced to ruins over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> carted away masonry for their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and town walls
        ‚Äî but the remains, in a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, are quietly eloquent of its
        noble past and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> still rings during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Arles Festival</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>).
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eglise Saint-Trophime</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place de la R√©publique</ENAMEX>), you
        can see the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> influence recurring in the triumphal-arch design of
        its splendid porch. This masterpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Proven√ßal Romanesque</ENAMEX> sculpture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">depicts the Last Judgment</ENAMEX> in the tympanum above the doors, surrounded
        by statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>. Nearby, the church cloister, Clo√Ætre
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Trophime</ENAMEX>, with its beautiful sculpted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> on the pillars, is
        a haven of peace.
        To the southeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, cut off by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway track</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the melancholy remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alyscamps</ENAMEX>, the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>

        when he came to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>.
        In the dramatic new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de l‚ÄôArles Antique</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue de la</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Camargue</ENAMEX>
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rh√¥ne</ENAMEX>, where its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> spill into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Medi¬≠ter¬≠ra¬≠nean</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camargue</ENAMEX> has been reclaimed from the sea to
        form a national nature reserve. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> is famous for its white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, which you can hire to ride along the sandflats; for the black
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bulls</ENAMEX> that race through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proven√</ENAMEX>ßal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bullfight</ENAMEX>; and for the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herons</ENAMEX>, and pink flamingos that
        gather here. There are relatively few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camargue</ENAMEX>, and
        those that do exist are not always very attractive. So many people
        choose ‚Äî despite the heat ‚Äî to follow the many hiking and riding trails
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the‚ÄÇarea</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Camargais</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albaron</ENAMEX> gives a glimpse of the
        traditional lifestyle of the area, and sets you off on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.5-km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-mile</NUMEX>) guided walk through the marshland, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Parc</ENAMEX> Ornithologique
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont de Gau</ENAMEX> allows you to watch a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird species</ENAMEX> without
        long hikes into the interior.
        But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camargue</ENAMEX> isn‚Äôt just a remote haven for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>;
        despite the dearth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> inland there are modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> along
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>, including the bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer</ENAMEX> with its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, sandy beaches, docking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for yachts, and good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">windsurfing ‚Äî</ENAMEX> there‚Äôs even a speed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surfers</ENAMEX> to reach
        world-record speeds. The local tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> will help you find
        organized tours into the interior ‚Äî on horseback, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jeep</ENAMEX>.
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is most famous for the annual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy</ENAMEX> pilgrimage that ends here
        with a festival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Baux-de-Provence</ENAMEX>
        The astounding sight of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medieval citadel</ENAMEX>, clinging to
        a massive outcrop of rock cut adrift from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alpilles mountains</ENAMEX>, takes
        your breath away. Officially acknowledged as one of the most beautiful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, it is also one of the major tourist attractions and
        can be unpleasantly crowded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">midsummer</TIMEX>.
        The feudal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Baux</ENAMEX> put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of the Nativity
        on their coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, claiming to be descendants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balthazar</ENAMEX>, one of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Three Wise Men</ENAMEX>. They ruled the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">79‚ÄÇtowns</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval Provence</ENAMEX> and
        their impregnable fortress became a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of courtly love prized by
        traveling troubadours.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barons</ENAMEX> defied the papal authority in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avignon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, offering refuge to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> during
        the Wars of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religion</ENAMEX>, until, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1632</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXIII</ENAMEX> ordered the
        destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Baux</ENAMEX>. The demolition of the citadel was a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">half-hearted</ENAMEX> job, however, and there‚Äôs plenty left to see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ramparts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> walls to ruined chapels, stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stairways</ENAMEX>, and
        quaint cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museums</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> all add
        to the charm.
        Visit at sundown or out of season to get the full flavor
        of the setting. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cath√©drale d‚ÄôImages</ENAMEX> uses a former limestone

        Avignon
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City of the Popes</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a proud cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest arts festivals, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round a

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX> reigned in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Avignon</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1309 until 1377</TIMEX>,
        followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> renegade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais des Papes</ENAMEX> is the resulting
        combination of feudal fortress and opulent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. During the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rev¬≠o¬≠lu¬≠tion</ENAMEX>, all evidence of luxury was stripped from the palace
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> itself proved stronger than its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assailants</ENAMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it hosts major productions during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">festival</ENAMEX>.
        The forbidding design of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais Vieux</ENAMEX>, reflecting the
        pious austerity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benedict‚ÄÇXII</ENAMEX>, contrasts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clement‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇVI‚Äôs
        more decorative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palais Nouveau</ENAMEX>. Frescoes adorn many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace cham¬≠bers</ENAMEX>,
        among them works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simone Martini</ENAMEX>, brought from the porch of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame des Doms cathedral</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petit Palais</ENAMEX>, at the northern end of the Place du
        Palais, displays, together with interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> sculpture and
        frescoes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avignon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, a fine collection of Italian painting
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the 13th</TIMEX> to 16th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, including major works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taddeo Gaddi</ENAMEX>,
        Veneziano, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Botticelli</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpaccio‚Äôs Holy Conversation</ENAMEX>.
        Beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">much-remodeled cathedral,</NUMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>,
        is the pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocher des Doms</ENAMEX>, extending to the outer
        ramparts. From here you will get your best view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAvignon ‚Äî
        more correctly called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pont Saint-B√</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">©n√©zet ‚Äî</ENAMEX> broken off halfway

        There are several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Avignon</ENAMEX>, the most exciting of
        which is the newest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fondation Angladon-Dubrujeaud</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Rue</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboureur</ENAMEX>) presents an exceptional private art collection including
        many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th- and 20th-century</TIMEX> masterpieces by the likes of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√©zanne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modigliani, Manet</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Degas</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> of the bustling life of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the airy

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des Marchands</ENAMEX>. At the far end are the Place
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J√©ru¬≠salem</ENAMEX> and an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>.
        For an interesting walk through the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, start at the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eglise Saint-Didier</ENAMEX>, with its altar sculpture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>
        Carry¬≠ing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francesco Laurana</ENAMEX>. The Rue

        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>; and on the pretty, cobblestoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des Tein¬</ENAMEX>≠tu¬≠riers you can
        see where the dyers used to work the paddlewheels for their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>-style cloth in the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sorgue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX>, emerging here from its

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lub√©ron</ENAMEX> and Vaucluse
        Starting out from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cavaillon</ENAMEX>, home of famously succulent
        cantaloupe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> east to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lub√©ron mountains</ENAMEX>, the heart of the
        Proven√ßal countryside and now a protected regional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Whole valleys
        are carpeted with lavender, and the garrigue scrubland shimmers with
        every color and fragrance of the sunny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> have
        been lovingly restored.
        Perched on a spur of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Opp√®de-le</ENAMEX>-Vieux
        has been rescued from its ruins by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> seeking a
        residence off the beaten track. M√©nerbes is also on a hill, with a
        medieval citadel that served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Protestants‚Äô</ENAMEX> last redoubt in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> Wars of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religion</ENAMEX>. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on the outskirts of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> there is a magnificent view over the mountains to the Vaucluse
        plateau and the distant peak of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont Ventoux</ENAMEX>.
        Bonnieux juts out over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coulon Valley</ENAMEX>. From the
        hillside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> behind the town hall, look northwest to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rust</ENAMEX>-colored ravines surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roussillon</ENAMEX>. In order to set off that
        startling red, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roussillon</ENAMEX> paint their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with
        every imaginable variation of ochre from the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">quarries</ENAMEX>.
        Its dramatic location, looking across to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lub√</ENAMEX>©ron from
        the southern edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaucluse</ENAMEX> plateau, has made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gordes</ENAMEX> one of the

        little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> hug the hillside on steep, winding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streets</ENAMEX>, leading to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> at the top. About‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ2‚</NUMEX>ÄÇkm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1‚ÄÇmile</ENAMEX>) south¬≠west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gordes</ENAMEX> is the strange little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village Noir</ENAMEX>,
        consisting of bories, old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dry-stone cabins grouped</ENAMEX> around a baker‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oven</ENAMEX> and serving as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of rural life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Provence</ENAMEX>.

        There are few more refreshing experiences than to arrive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aix</ENAMEX> at the
        end of a long hot <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and walk under the arching plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and
        past the fountains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cours Mirabeau</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is a
        quiet row of gracious buff-colored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, now home to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and pastry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> dispensing calissons, the celebrated local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">delicacy</ENAMEX> made from ground almonds, orange, and candied melon. The other
        side is a bustle of cinemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and caf√©s.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> still come to take the waters ‚Äî the moss-covered

        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most attractive of these squares is the tranquil Place

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is less worthy of your attention than its

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul C√©zanne</ENAMEX> spent the greater part of his life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aix</ENAMEX>,

        preserved as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, including his palette and other personal

        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aix</ENAMEX> on‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ÄÇD10</TIMEX>.
        C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur
        When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> invented this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> in the 19th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, they called it the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX>, distinguishing it from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> one that begins round the corner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ventimiglia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs
        considered more chic to use its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> name, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAzur.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> it‚Äôs overcrowded, but that‚Äôs part of the fun.
        You can always head away from the coast and into the hills for some
        peace. Most of the beaches are great; the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">good-looking</ENAMEX>, and even the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> makes for entertaining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching. Good weather, with hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">balmy nights</TIMEX>, is
        almost guaranteed and apart from the occasional unsightly modern
        apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX>, the coastline outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> has considerable
        charm. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> umbrella pines share the landscape with acacia,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eucalyptus</ENAMEX>, and palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> imported by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX>.

        This noisy, boisterous, multicultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is not a
        typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> tourist destination. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, founded

        has worked hard to rid itself of its seedy image as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of
        corruption and drug trafficking, and vast renovations in both the city

        a wide variety of urban landscapes, from peaceful squares and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> to
        the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and steep stairs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">medieval Panier district</ENAMEX>,
        which make you feel as if you have left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> altogether. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trious</ENAMEX>), located on a grassy hill just outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Here sculpture

        corniches: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande</ENAMEX>, the high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, starting out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue des</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diables-Bleus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nice</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moyenne</ENAMEX>, the middle one, beginning at Place

        usually jammed with traffic. Above them all runs the high-speed
        autoroute, a challenging drive itself.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Corniche</ENAMEX> follows the route of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX>
        road, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Aurelia</ENAMEX>. Stop off at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Belv√©d√®re</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">d‚ÄôEze</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Turbie</ENAMEX> for great
        views of the coast, especially the lights of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monaco</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La</ENAMEX>

        The highlight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moyenne Corniche</ENAMEX>, the best road of

        above the sea, it was once the fortress of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ligurian</ENAMEX> brigands. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>
        it‚Äôs a bit of a tourist trap, but take a look at the cacti and tropical

        Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> affords the best (but not free) view of the coast.
        The pretty hillside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Villefranche-sur-Mer</ENAMEX> is a good

        The deep¬≠-water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> allows cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and even aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anchor</ENAMEX>, so the sandy beaches and colorful waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caf√©s</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> can become quite crowded. But if you climb the maze of
        steep narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> into the upper part, you‚Äôll find peaceful, shady
        squares. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Cocteau</ENAMEX> decorated the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapelle Saint Pierre</ENAMEX> (Quai

        (industrial and noisy, but with a colorful old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>) and the more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attractive Ajaccio</ENAMEX>.
        You can alternate lazy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> on the beach with some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Medi¬≠ter¬≠ra¬≠nean‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best deep-sea diving, boat excursions around pirate
        coves, canoeing and fishing on inland rivers, or hikes and picnics in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>. For the vacationer, the best seaside resorts are along
        the indented shorelines of the west and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south</ENAMEX> coasts, for which
        Ajaccio‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> (for the car ferry from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toulon</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marseilles</ENAMEX>) provide a convenient gateway. Give yourself plenty of
        driving time to reach your destination, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> are narrow and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tortuous</ENAMEX>.
        Ajaccio
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Ajaccio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX>
        is the liveliest of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Corsican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> impatient to get out
        to the seaside resorts are usually content with a stroll around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">port</ENAMEX> and a pilgrimage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison Bonaparte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue Saint-Charles</ENAMEX>). A
        guided tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> will tell you how, on <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Assumption Day</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1769</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Letizia</ENAMEX> was rushed out of church

        sofa to bring little Nabulio kicking and screaming into the world he
        was to conquer. The sofa you see there now is a replica, the original
        having been stolen during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of Ajaccio</ENAMEX>, the major

        and good opportunities for sailing and deep-sea diving.
        Bonifacio
        The best way to approach this proud old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> perched high
        on the cliffs is by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, past the limpid blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of the Sdragonato
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cave</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escalier du Roi</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAragon, a staircase cut diagonally into
        the cliff face, used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> in an abortive
        siege of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>. When you are visiting the old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> on foot, you can enjoy an exhilarating walk down the staircase to
        the base of the cliffs and along the water‚Äôs edge.
        Porto-Vecchio
        Surrounded by a pretty forest of cork <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> and
        sweet-smelling eucalyptus, the gulf surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto-Vecchio</ENAMEX> boasts an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ever-expanding</ENAMEX> series of luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, the best being out on the fine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sandy</ENAMEX> beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Rossa</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX>, there are some beautiful
        excursions to be made into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> of l‚ÄôOspedale and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zonza</ENAMEX>. The
        cork <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> are stripped of their valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bark</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every ten years or so</TIMEX>,
        baring a ¬≠russet-brown trunk until the cork grows back again.
        For a memorable picnic up on the lovely wild mountain pass
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bavella</ENAMEX>, take some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious Corsican tomatoes</ENAMEX>, smoked liver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sausage</ENAMEX> (figatelli), and ewe‚Äôs or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goat‚Äôs milk cheese</ENAMEX> (broccio). Be
        careful with the heady <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Corsican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>; the most enjoyable ones are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ros√©s.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golfe de Porto</ENAMEX>
        Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most grandiose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panoramas</ENAMEX> of sea and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajaccio</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piana</ENAMEX> is the most delightful of the gulf‚Äôs sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>, unspoiled by commercialization and blessed with the nearby
        natural wonders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capo Rosso</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calanche</ENAMEX>. These rugged
        red<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-granite¬≠ cliffs</ENAMEX> and boulders have been hurled down to the sea by
        volcanic eruptions and eroded there by wind and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, forming the most
        bizarre and fantastic shapes. Take the well-marked walk on the Chemin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">du Ch√</ENAMEX>¢teau-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX> to admire them.
        Don‚Äôt miss taking a boat cruise from the little resort
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town of Porto</ENAMEX>. The best <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> goes out to the cliff caves on the northern
        edge of the gulf, to the isolated fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girolata</ENAMEX> and the
        nature reserve of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandola</ENAMEX> ‚Äî a marvelous coastal haven for eagles, bald
        buzzards, and other rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species nesting</ENAMEX> on the peaks of the volcanic
        rocks.
        In the interior, drive along the winding mountain road to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evisa</ENAMEX> and the cool, quiet Forest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A√Øtone</ENAMEX>. Off the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">D84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3‚</NUMEX>ÄÇkm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evisa</ENAMEX>, is a sign reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piscine</ENAMEX>. This is not a
        municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX>-saturated swimming pool, but a series of clear,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX>, natural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> formed in smooth slabs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> by the Cascades
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d‚ÄôA√Øtone</ENAMEX> (waterfalls) ‚Äî a sheer delight.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOUTHWEST</ENAMEX>
        The area extending from the southern edge of the Loire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pyr√©n√©es</ENAMEX> and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> into the Massif
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> coast encompasses a variety of
        terrains, all distant in geography and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> alike from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and the
        industrial north.
        In and around the lovely valley of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dordogne, P√</ENAMEX>©rigord
        beckons enticingly, with its rich <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>, fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, and
        fascinating cave paintings and other prehistoric remains.
        Below the estuary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> is the
        preserve of the country‚Äôs most independent-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX>
        strong¬≠hold of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rochelle</ENAMEX> and the proud, prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX>.
        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Basque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, you can
        explore the sunny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyr√©n√©es.</ENAMEX> And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX>, you‚Äôll come upon the
        historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toulouse, Albi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montpellier</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berry</ENAMEX>-Limousin
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> driving from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dordogne</ENAMEX> and
        Toulouse speed through this area on the autoroute, missing some very
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">pleasant</ENAMEX> countryside and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and the joy of driving on more relaxing
        routes nationales. Among the stops to consider are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bourges, Limoges</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzerche</ENAMEX>.
        Bourges
        Ancient capital of the flat region of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> on the
        northern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√©rigord</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bourges</ENAMEX> is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> south to
        Clermont-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ferrand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montpellier</ENAMEX> but worth a brief detour for those
        using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">the‚ÄÇA20</ENAMEX>.
        The intricate harmony of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> portals of its fa√ßade,
        and the peculiar grace of its silhouette, make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bourges‚Äôs Cath√</ENAMEX>©drale
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Etienne</ENAMEX> one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half-dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> masterpieces. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> is dominated by the massive nave and graceful flying buttresses
        linking the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> chapels to the chancel. The best view is from the
        arch¬≠bishop‚Äôs gardens behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. The Last Judgment portrayed
        on the center portal is an example of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> sculpture at its
        best.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palais Jacques-C≈ìur</ENAMEX>, a rare example of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> secular
        architecture, was the luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of a wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Charles VII</ENAMEX>. The elegance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> becomes apparent
        only in the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">turreted staircases</ENAMEX> and
        handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>. The mottos engraved around the windows proclaim the
        self-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúA vaillans</ENAMEX> (c≈ìurs) riens impossible‚Äù (‚ÄúTo valiant
        hearts, nothing is impossible‚Äù<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">) and ‚ÄúDire</ENAMEX>, faire, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">taire‚Äù (‚ÄúSay</ENAMEX>, do, and
        be silent‚Äù). Note the pigeon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">loft</ENAMEX> from which, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques C≈ìur</ENAMEX> organized a private news service
        using carrier pigeons.
        During the tourist season splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">illuminations</ENAMEX> make
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exploring Bourges</ENAMEX> in the evenings a pleasure. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> in
        particular is impressive after dark.
        Limoges
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limoges</ENAMEX> is best known for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> and enamel, and
        still produces a major portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tableware. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18th</NUMEX>-c entury
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Municipal de l‚ÄôEv√™ch√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place de la Cath√©drale</ENAMEX>) contains an enamel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> as well as a lapidary collection and a handful of paint¬≠ings by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renoir</ENAMEX>, who was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Limoges</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Nation¬≠al de la Porcelaine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrien Dubouch√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place Winston Churchill</ENAMEX>) traces the history of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pottery</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">china</ENAMEX>, stoneware, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 12,000‚</NUMEX>ÄÇitems
        on display.
        Other sights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Limoges</ENAMEX> include its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cath√</ENAMEX>©drale
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Etienne</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> masterpiece that took <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600‚ÄÇyears</NUMEX> to complete,
        and the part of the haute ville (also called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ch√¢teau</ENAMEX>) that contains
        the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue de la Boucherie</ENAMEX> and pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cour du Temple</ENAMEX>.
        There are pleasant walks along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the river
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vienne</ENAMEX>.
        Uzerche
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúPearl of Limousin‚</ENAMEX>Äù consists of an impressive
        collection of slate-roofed turrets and towers rising high above the
        V√©z√®re river. A fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that withstood many sieges in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ages</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uzerche</ENAMEX> later became a favorite of prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who built
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor houses</ENAMEX> on the steep slopes. Among the structures of note are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancient Porte B√©charie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tour du</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> Eglise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">crypt</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ren¬≠ais¬≠sance</ENAMEX> H√¥tel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d‚ÄôEyssartier</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place de la Lib√©ration</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Trucks</ENAMEX> on the route nationale
        used to roar through the narrow main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, but since construction of
        the autoroute, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzerche</ENAMEX> has become a peaceful place to walk and admire
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16th</NUMEX>-, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">17th-</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> architecture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L‚ÄôEsplanade de la</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lunade</ENAMEX> provides a great view down onto the river below.
        P√©rigord
        This rich and fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is densely forested and
        crisscrossed by rivers flowing from the plateau of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massif Central</ENAMEX>
        out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>. Of these, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dordogne</ENAMEX> has carved a
        particularly beautiful winding valley of gentle greenery.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> markets groan with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX> and nuts of every description. Truffles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">p√¢t√© de foie gras</ENAMEX>,
        and slowly roasted confit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> are specialties, as are
        wild <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX>, dried and smoked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">walnut oil</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> found abundant fish in the rivers and
        dwellings safe from wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the caves riddling the valley
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cliffs</ENAMEX>. With a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> for self-protection, the proliferation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">for¬≠tresses</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">P√©ri¬≠gord</ENAMEX> region bears witness to the
        many wars against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>, be¬≠tween <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX>, and
        resistance to the marauding bands of brigands.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vall√©e de la V√</ENAMEX>©z√®re
        Exploring this valley that shelters the earliest signs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> civilization is by no means a dry and dusty archaeological
        tour of fossils and bones. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> who are suffering from an overload
        of art and architecture will enjoy the caves with their stalactites and
        stalagmites, as well as the exhibits and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Thot</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> alike will appreciate the hanging cliffs and pleasant
        countryside of meadows, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, and orchards, with graceful willows
        and poplars at the water‚Äôs edge.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montignac</ENAMEX> is the departure point for visits to the
        world-famous cave paintings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lascaux</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concealed</ENAMEX> and protected against
        atmospheric changes for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17,000‚ÄÇyears</NUMEX>, these awe-inspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frescoes</ENAMEX> and
        engravings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, ibex, bison, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> were discovered by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> chasing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> in‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ1940</NUMEX>.
        Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> generated by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> caused a rapid deterioration in the cave walls, and
        the caves had to be closed to the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>. A careful replica
        that was created at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lascaux‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇII makes a satisfying alternative.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthro¬≠pol¬≠o¬≠gists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> have reproduced the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Painted Gallery</ENAMEX> and

        audiovisual exhibits and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of cave life; the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> has been
        turned into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> portrayed at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lascaux</ENAMEX>.
        Returning to the river, you will pass <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ch√¢teau de Losse</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can admire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> furniture and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tapestries</ENAMEX>) on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint-L√©on-sur-V√©z√®re</ENAMEX>. Surrounded by poplars
        and willows, the town‚Äôs buff-stoned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is a
        characteristic example of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">P√©rigord Romanesque</ENAMEX>.
        For a wonderful view of the valley, climb to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roque Saint-Christophe</ENAMEX>, a spectacular cliff <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80‚ÄÇm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">262‚ÄÇft</ENAMEX>) high,
        honeycombed with caves where you can see traces of troglodytic
        life.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Eyzies-de-Tayac</ENAMEX> is known, justifiably, as ‚Äúcapitale de
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la pr√©histoire.</ENAMEX> ‚Äù Besides its important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in the remains of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">medieval</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is at the center of literally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of
        major palaeolithic excavation sites. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cro-Magnon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abri de</ENAMEX>
        Cro-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Magnon</ENAMEX>) on the north side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the spot where, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> uncovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three 30,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human skel¬</ENAMEX>≠e¬≠tons
        beside their flint and bone tools. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Anthropologists</ENAMEX> say that these tall,
        large-brained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with high foreheads (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homo sapiens sapiens</ENAMEX>) were of a
        physical type still found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
        For cave paintings, all accessible by guided tour only,
        the most attractive site is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grotte de Font-de-Gaume</ENAMEX>, reached by an
        easy walk up on a cliff above the eastern edge of town. The pictures of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mammoths</ENAMEX>, bison, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, and reindeer are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">between 15,000 and</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000‚</NUMEX>ÄÇyears old. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Combarelles cave</ENAMEX>, farther to the east, is a long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">winding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> where the pictures are engraved rather than painted,
        and very often superimposed. Access to this cave is limited, so book
        early in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>.
        The caverns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grotte du Grand Roc</ENAMEX>, to the northwest
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Eyzies</ENAMEX>, are a natural rather than a historical phenomenon, but
        well worth a visit for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weirdly</ENAMEX> shaped stalagmites and stalactites
        and the panorama of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">V√©z√®re Valley</ENAMEX>.
        Dordogne
        The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dordogne</ENAMEX> is given to a river, a d√©partement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and to a larger surrounding area that is sometimes extended to
        the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">P√©rigord</ENAMEX> region. It has been popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have chosen to become
        permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
        The river itself flows through changing terrain, from its
        source in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Auvergne mountains</ENAMEX> through deep gorges to fertile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lowlands</ENAMEX> and on to the sea near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX>.
        The landscape in the tour proposed below is dominated by
        the river as it flows between limestone cliffs, meadows, and woodland.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> is good for both fishing and canoeing, and if you haven‚Äôt
        brought your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> for exploring the back country, you can rent one
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarlat</ENAMEX>.
        Start at the confluence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V√©z√®re</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dordogne</ENAMEX> rivers,
        where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limeuil</ENAMEX> affords a fine view of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valleys</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> meeting at right angles down below. Drive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">south</ENAMEX> away from the river to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cadouin</ENAMEX>, with its impressive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX>
        Cister¬≠cian ab¬≠bey, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">P√©rigord Roman¬</ENAMEX>≠esque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with wooden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">belfry</ENAMEX> on a remarkable split pyramidal cupola. The soberly designed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> contrasts with the more decorative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ren¬</ENAMEX>≠ais¬≠sance
        sculpture of the cloister.
        Back on the river, perched above <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a 150-m</NUMEX>- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">490-ft-</ENAMEX>) deep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ravine</ENAMEX>, is the fairytale <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beynac-et-Cazenac</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barons</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beynac</ENAMEX> lost it in turn to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion-Heart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon de Montfort</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leicester</ENAMEX>, before turning it into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Across
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beynac‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castelnaud</ENAMEX>, its ruins recently restored
        and now housing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of medieval warfare, and the privately owned
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fayrac</ENAMEX>, complete with restored drawbridge,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">battlements</ENAMEX>, and pepperpot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Roque-Gageac</ENAMEX>, glued to an overhanging
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cliff</ENAMEX>, is known as one of the most beautiful (and most visited) in the
        country ‚Äî especially well-deserved when the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-afternoon</TIMEX> sun catches
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">houses‚Äô stone</ENAMEX>-tiled roofs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also an antiques-collector‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paradise</ENAMEX>.
        To get a wonderful view of the whole stretch of river, and
        to stretch your legs in a beautiful parklike setting, climb up to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ch√¢teau de Marqueyssac</ENAMEX> and its jardins suspendus (hanging gardens).
        Sarlat, capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√©rigord Noir</ENAMEX>, is a lovely old town
        with a fine mix of architecture, bustling in high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> but quiet in
        spring and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> market is a joy, as are the narrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> east of the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue de la R√©publique.</ENAMEX> Look out
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue F√©nelon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consuls</ENAMEX> (especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel Plamon</ENAMEX>) and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Place du Peyrou‚Äôs</ENAMEX> grand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison de la Bo√©tie</ENAMEX>, across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. An open-air summer
        festival is held on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place de la Libert√©</ENAMEX>, the marketplace and a center
        for caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. Specialties of the region are truffles, wild
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foie gras</ENAMEX>, and walnuts. Don‚Äôt leave without trying the
        pommes sarladaises, thin-sliced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes saut√</ENAMEX>©ed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goose fat</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">garlic</ENAMEX> and parsley.
        Rocamadour
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>, sightseers and religious pilgrims
        alike have been flocking to this spectacularly situated fortified town
        atop a cliff above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alzou river</ENAMEX> (best appreciated from the village
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L‚ÄôHos¬≠pi¬≠ta¬≠let</ENAMEX> across the valley). Founded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of a hermit,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Amadour</ENAMEX>, which was believed to have mystic curative powers,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocamadour</ENAMEX> attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry‚ÄÇII of England</ENAMEX> and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>
        after him.
        The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> mobs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> buzzing around the
        souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> of the old town capture something of the medieval
        frenzy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pil¬≠grims</ENAMEX> would climb the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">216</NUMEX> steps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Sancta</ENAMEX> on their
        knees to get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> halfway up the hillside, which include the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cha¬≠pelle Mira¬≠cu¬≠leuse de Notre-Dame</ENAMEX> with its statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vir¬≠gin</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basilica</ENAMEX>. High¬≠er up, at the top of the

        river for a spooky boat ride past gigantic stalactites and stalagmites,
        formed by the calcite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> and deposits of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of
        persistently dripping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic Coast</ENAMEX>
        In contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> coast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>
        offers wide open spaces, beaches with rolling waves and high dunes, and
        vast stretches of quiet pine forests. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> and seafood are good
        and abundant, and there‚Äôs plenty for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to do.

        electing its first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1199</TIMEX>, and was long a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> bastion in
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. More recently it has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in urban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planning</ENAMEX>, careful to preserve its quiet charm and dignity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rochelle</ENAMEX>
        was one of the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to introduce a pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> and

        Surrounded by lively caf√©s, with an avenue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> along

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-Emilion
        At the western end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dordogne Valley</ENAMEX>, this is
        undoubtedly the most attractive of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> wine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, not
        least due to the golden-tinted stone of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval houses</ENAMEX> around its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sleepy Place du March√©.</ENAMEX> Unique in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000-year-old</TIMEX> church

        Tourism in the high mountains is little-developed; there is some

        in the unspoiled scenery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc National des Pyr√©n√©es</ENAMEX>, where

        Tour¬≠ist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> throughout the region can help with information on the

        duty-free shopping. There is good hiking away from the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, but
        it is a long hard drive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> side.
        The foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyr√</ENAMEX>©n√©es form a landscape of gentle

        impressive when illuminated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> park on the east side
        of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la Cit√©</ENAMEX>) and walk over the drawbridge of the Porte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nar¬≠bon¬≠naise.</ENAMEX> But you‚Äôll get a much better feel for the medieval
        atmosphere of a fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, with its ramparts and lookout <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>,
        if you <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on the western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX>, by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Gimer</ENAMEX>, and walk
        up around the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ch√¢teau Comtal</ENAMEX>.
        Although much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carcassonne</ENAMEX> is authentic, the famous
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> who masterminded the restoration work took some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberties</ENAMEX> when he lacked the original plans. A blatant example of this
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Romanesque-Gothic Basilique Saint-Nazaire ‚Äî</ENAMEX> which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viollet-le</ENAMEX>-Duc
        thought was originally part of the fortifications and so blithely added
        battlements to the west fa√ßade. Inside the basilica, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>, you
        can see some fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th- and 14th-century</TIMEX> sculptures and stained-glass
        windows.
        Montpellier
        In this lively university <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> end
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South¬≠west</ENAMEX>, the center of city life is around the broad,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bustling Place de la Com√©die</ENAMEX>.
        For a quieter glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> or cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, try the
        pretty Place <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">du March√©-aux-Fleurs</ENAMEX>, shaded by plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> around a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> sculpture. And on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des Tr√©soriers de France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rue des</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tr√©soriers de la Bourse</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll discover handsome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17th</NUMEX>- and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> that have imposing stairways in the inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">courtyards</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e Fabre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard Sarrail</ENAMEX>) has an outstanding art
        collection, including important paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Courbet, Delacroix</ENAMEX>,
        Veronese, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zurbar√°n.</ENAMEX>
        For many, the most enchanting spot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Promenade du Peyrou</ENAMEX> ‚Äî spacious classical gardens with
        a triumphal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>, an equestrian statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXIV</ENAMEX>, and, on a mound at
        the far end, a hexagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ch√¢teau d‚Äôeau</ENAMEX> (water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>) that looks more
        like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, providing a fine view south to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">C√©vennes mountains</ENAMEX>.
        For a refreshing look at modern urban development, visit
        the new, neoclassical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Antigone quarter</TIMEX>, just on the opposite side of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Place de la Com√</ENAMEX>©die from the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B√©ziers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golfe du Lion</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montpellier</ENAMEX> is a good base for visits both south into
        Languedoc-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Roussillon</ENAMEX> and east into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camargue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX>. This
        proposed route takes you through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> and beaches of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√©rault.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montpellier</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N113</TIMEX>, you will get a good
        view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bassin de Thau</ENAMEX> and the oyster and mussel beds near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bouzigues</ENAMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√®ze</ENAMEX>, the road turns inland and passes through
        Montagnac, site of an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th</TIMEX> and 14th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>.
        Just a little further south is the little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√©zenas</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> of the region in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th and 17th</TIMEX> centuries
        and once called the ‚ÄúVersailles of the south. ‚Äù You can easily spend a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">couple of hours</TIMEX> strolling around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> looking at the fine mansions
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 or more</NUMEX>) and the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ghetto</ENAMEX>. A
        brochure from the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> gives a suggested walking tour and the
        sights are well marked. Keep your eyes open for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> details,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">doorways</ENAMEX>, and views into lovely courtyards. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
        to watch for are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel des Barons de Lacoste</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 Rue</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois-Oustrin</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maison des Pauvres</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue Alfred Sabatier</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mus√©e de Vulliod-Saint-Germain</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue Albert-Paul Alli√®s</ENAMEX>) has
        collections of furniture, fa√Øences, and tapestries, as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">memorabilia of the time Moli√®re</ENAMEX> spent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>.
        B√©ziers is a busy but compact <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with a delightful
        shady central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> ‚Äî lined with caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> ‚Äî called the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">All√©es Paul Riquet</ENAMEX>, named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal du Midi</ENAMEX>. Among
        the sights in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">B√</ENAMEX>©ziers are the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eglise Saint Jacques</ENAMEX> and Eglise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sainte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Halles</ENAMEX> (covered market), and the
        massive <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cath√©drale Saint-Nazaire</ENAMEX>, from which there is a good view over
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">river valley</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal du Midi</ENAMEX> crosses the river <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orb</ENAMEX> on a bridge
        (pont <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">at‚ÄÇB√©ziers</ENAMEX>.
        Turning east from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B√</ENAMEX>©ziers on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N112</TIMEX> and after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13‚</NUMEX>ÄÇkm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8‚ÄÇmiles</ENAMEX>) briefly onto <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D912</TIMEX>, your next stop is the ancient port of
        Agde, founded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 centuries ago</TIMEX>. Agde presents a
        somber face ‚Äî many of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were constructed from the local
        volcanic basalt, including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cath√©drale Saint-Etienne ‚</ENAMEX>Äî
        but the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> on the hill leading up to the market square are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cheerful</ENAMEX> and friendly.
        For a total change of pace, continue on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N112</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d‚ÄôAgde.</ENAMEX> Only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agde</ENAMEX> itself, this is a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> built in
        traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Languedoc</ENAMEX> style. Its many quays bristle with luxury yachts
        and there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> to suit every taste. It
        also features a large nudist enclave (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Nature</ENAMEX>).
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Agde</ENAMEX>, take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the D51</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marseillan</ENAMEX>, another ancient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">port</ENAMEX>, initially settled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX>. The covered market, built
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">volcanic stone</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Agde</ENAMEX> with a timber frame, dates back to the 17th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. The harbor, with views across the bay toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S√®te</ENAMEX>, is a
        pleasant walk from the middle of town. Take time to sit at a caf√© and
        watch the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> mix with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in yachts and narrowboats
        headed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal du Midi</ENAMEX>. Also in the harbor are the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chais</ENAMEX> Noilly
        Prat, where you can view how the famous vermouth is made, and a small
        ch√¢teau that was once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noilly Prat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, now a hotel
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marseillan</ENAMEX>, our route takes you toward
        Marseillan-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plage</ENAMEX> and up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the N112</TIMEX> along <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than seven miles</NUMEX> of flat,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sandy beach ‚Äî</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> and numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> can
        make this a slow trip ‚Äî to the large fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√®te.</ENAMEX> Although the
        narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and squares above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX> have lots to offer the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visitor</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gravitate to the caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> along the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>®te is famous for its traditional jousting
        competitions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>. For panoramic views, visit the hilltop
        Cimeti√®re <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial place</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Val√</ENAMEX>©ry and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georges Brassens</ENAMEX>, before heading back up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">N112</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">to‚ÄÇMontpellier</ENAMEX>.
