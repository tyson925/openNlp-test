        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem‚Äôs</ENAMEX> recorded history begins with its mention in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX> court records <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4,000 years ago</TIMEX>, but there had been human
        settlements here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, probably millennia, before that. At the
        beginning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second millennium b.c.</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was a Canaanite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mountain</ENAMEX> stronghold on a secondary trade route, far less important than
        biblical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazor, Megiddo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beth Shean</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shechem</ENAMEX>. The
        earliest name associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ur</ENAMEX> usalim, perhaps meant ‚Äúcity
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shalim‚</ENAMEX>Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúfounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shalim</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scholars</ENAMEX> speculate that Shalim
        might have been an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Semitic</ENAMEX> deity of peace, for the name
        resembles the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> words for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpeace‚Äù</ENAMEX>: shalom and
        salaam, respectively. If true, this is an ironic name for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that
        would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places
        on the face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblical Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Genesis 14</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">18‚Äì20</ENAMEX> records that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX> visited
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúSalem‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 1800</TIMEX> b.c. and was blessed by the
        city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melchzedik</ENAMEX>, who offered him <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is
        not mentioned again in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> until the time of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">warrior</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, who captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jebusites</ENAMEX> in about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">1000 b.c. The Bible</ENAMEX> describes how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">David‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> conquered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
        by discovering a water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> under the walls and using it to take the
        city by surprise. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Warren‚Äôs Shaft</ENAMEX>, part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canaanite</ENAMEX> water system
        discovered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> and open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, might
        be the very tunnel infiltrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>.
        Perhaps because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was in neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> not
        allotted to any of the twelve rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> made it the
        capital of his newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> and brought the most talented
        artisans, dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, magical poets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX>, and the most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">formidable soldiers</ENAMEX> from each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> to live in his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. He
        also brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covenant</ENAMEX>, the portable tabernacle
        containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tablets of the Law</ENAMEX> received on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Sinai</ENAMEX>, to the
        Spring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gihon</ENAMEX>, just outside the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. There the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark</ENAMEX>
        rested until it was placed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, built in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 960</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c.</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Moriah</ENAMEX>, the high point at the northern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> known as the ‚ÄúFirst‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>) was completed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX>. According to biblical
        tradition, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> bought the land for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> and carefully
        assembled its building materials, he was deemed unworthy of
        constructing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> because he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> of war with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> on his
        hands. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple‚Äôs</ENAMEX> dedication, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX> addressed his God: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äú... the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heavens</ENAMEX>, even the Heaven of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavens</ENAMEX>, cannot contain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thee</ENAMEX>; how much
        less this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> that I have built? ‚Äù
        The site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> eventually became identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt.</ENAMEX>
        Moriah, on which it stood, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX> was called to sacrifice his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">son Isaac</ENAMEX>. Along with this splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of worship, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX> built a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>, temples for the foreign gods
        worshipped by the princesses he had married, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> for the defense
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. Under the wise reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> flourished as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> that stretched from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Damascus</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX>
        and controlled the trade routes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> were adorned with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>; the beauties and glories of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX>
        have captivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 3,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. But with
        his death the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> collapsed, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> was divided
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate, impoverished, often warring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, with
        its capital at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shechem</ENAMEX> in the north, ruled by a series of northern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynasties</ENAMEX>; and the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX>, with its capital at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davidic</ENAMEX> dynasty continued to rule. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>
        tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of both kingdoms
        aroused the fury of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prophets</ENAMEX>.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">701</NUMEX> b.c. the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assyrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sennacherib</ENAMEX> destroyed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and moved southward to besiege <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. Thanks to King
        Hezekiah‚Äôs hidden water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> narrowly escaped destruction.
        The end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dynasty came in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">587 b.c.</TIMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nebuchadnezzar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylon</ENAMEX>, invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX> to lay siege to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. When it fell, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were burned. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the
        once-glorious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> were forced into an exile known as ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylonian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Captivity</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        In time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylon</ENAMEX> was overthrown and the
        Israelites were permitted to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">539 b.c.</TIMEX> The city
        was now under the more tolerant rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX>, but rebuilding
        was slow work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Temple</ENAMEX> was finished in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">515 b.c.</TIMEX> , but much of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> still lay in ruins.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> submitted peaceably to the rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">332</NUMEX> b.c. under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX> and, subsequently, to his
        Hellenistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptolomeys</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seleucids</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Seleucid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> outlawed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Judaism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maccabee</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> staged a revolution in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">167 b.c.</TIMEX> and, against
        all odds, restored the primacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> religious life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macabbees</ENAMEX> cleansed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Hellenistic</ENAMEX> idols and the blood of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pagan</ENAMEX> sacrifices; the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight-day</TIMEX> celebration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanukkah</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feast of</ENAMEX>
        Dedication) commemorates their victory. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasmonean</ENAMEX> dynasty,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maccabee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, ruled an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>
        Commonwealth that stretched from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Negev</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galilee</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
        grew, surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jaffa Gate</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasmoneans</ENAMEX> ruled until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pompey‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> legions
        arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> b.c.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
        After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the initial years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> administration and
        political infighting, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> installed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herod</ENAMEX> (scion of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from
        Idumea, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> in the desert) as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Judea</ENAMEX>. He reigned
        from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 to 4</TIMEX> b.c. , during which time he fortified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasmonean</ENAMEX> wall
        and rebuilt the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> beside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jaffa Gate</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of
        which still stand. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> were built and a water system
        installed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herod</ENAMEX> also completely rebuilt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, making it one of
        the most important religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> was expanded to accommodate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of
        pilgrims, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple Mount</ENAMEX> was shored up by retaining walls made
        with great <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> blocks. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these walls, the Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX>, is today
        a major reminder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatness under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Herod</ENAMEX>. A massive
        fortress was built overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple Mount</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herod</ENAMEX> named
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúAntonia‚Äù</ENAMEX> in honor of his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and benefactor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Antony</ENAMEX>.
        For all his accomplishments, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herod</ENAMEX> was nevertheless hated
        by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>; he taxed, he tortured, and he ordered the massacre of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">male Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> in an attempt to do away with the heralded <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Messiah</ENAMEX>.
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> was born in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 4 b.c.</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> escaped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herod‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX> by fleeing into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> with the new-born infant. They returned
        to live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Galilee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazareth</ENAMEX>, making pilgrimages to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>.
        According to biblical accounts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> spent his life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ministering</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Galilee Valley</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a.d. 30</TIMEX> he and his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> went for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Passover</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, which was in unrest at this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, dissatisfied with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> domination. Jesus‚Äôs entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>
        caused a commotion; after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Passover</TIMEX> dinner he was arrested by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, who were under direct <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> rule. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> was put on
        trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> form of execution
        for political and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissidents</ENAMEX> as well as for common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>.
        In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> rife with rebellion and retaliation, the execution in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> of yet another religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galilee</ENAMEX> did not by
        itself have an immediate effect on history.
        After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs crucifixion, harsh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> rule continued until
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.d.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> rebelled. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zealots</ENAMEX> fought
        against the might of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. At the end, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX> laid
        siege to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 70</TIMEX>, finally attacking its starved and
        weakened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX>. Those who didn‚Äôt escape were executed or sold into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slavery</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy City</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> were destroyed. The last of the
        zealots held out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another three years</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masada</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>). Half
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> died in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galilee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Judea</ENAMEX> as a result of this
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> revolt against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, a number unequaled in ancient warfare.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamic Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> lay in ruins, until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Hadrian</ENAMEX> ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> rebuilt as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> dedicated to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX>. In outrage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> began a second revolt against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, led
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon bar Kochba</ENAMEX>. The ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> were briefly liberated,
        but, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> was defeated with great loss
        of life. The planned new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aelia Capitolina</ENAMEX>, was built over
        the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herodian Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were barred from residing
        there for all time. Jerusalem‚Äôs physical existence as a spiritual city
        seemed finished, but its spiritual power for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, and for the
        struggling new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> religion, remained. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two centuries</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aelia Capitolina</ENAMEX> enjoyed an innocuous history.
        But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of religion once again. Queen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helena</ENAMEX>, a devout <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>, made a pilgrimage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">326</NUMEX> to identify the sites
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs life. She found that the city‚Äôs most beautiful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aphrodite</ENAMEX>, stood on the site of
        the crucifixion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was demolished and a vast, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Classical</ENAMEX>-style
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> was built around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golgotha</ENAMEX> (the hill where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs crucifixion
        was believed to have taken place). Throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, other spots
        important to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs life were commemorated with religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilgrims</ENAMEX> came from all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> (and, later, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following centuries</TIMEX>, but the prosperity they brought lasted
        only until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">614</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> overtook <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Judea</ENAMEX> and reduced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> to rubble again. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">629</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was recaptured by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantines</ENAMEX>.
        Still reeling from the effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> devastation,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was conquered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">638</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of Islam. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple Mount</ENAMEX>
        was identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> tradition as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúthe farthest spot‚Äù</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el-aksa</ENAMEX>), the site to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prophet Muhammad</ENAMEX> was transported in one
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mecca</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">winged horse</ENAMEX>, as described in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th</TIMEX> chapter of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koran</ENAMEX>. From here the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prophet</ENAMEX> ascended to the heavens and was
        permitted to glimpse paradise. The rock on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple Mount</ENAMEX> from which
        he ascended, at or close to the site of the ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, was
        commemorated by the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dome of the Rock</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">691</TIMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dome of the Rock</ENAMEX> remains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerusalem‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most striking monument; it is
        counted among the most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> ever created. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 715</NUMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El-Aksa Mosque</ENAMEX>, third holiest place of prayer in Islam (after Mecca
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medina</ENAMEX>), had been built on the southern side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple Mount</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> continued under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> rule for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next four and a half</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1099</TIMEX>, under their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godfrey de Bouillon</ENAMEX> and
        Tancred, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> captured the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy City</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christendom</ENAMEX> by
        slaughtering both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mamelukes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> established a feudal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> with
        Godfrey at its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. They built many impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> during the
        term of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1187</TIMEX> they were
        driven out by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> under the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saladin</ENAMEX>. During the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixth Crusade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1228‚Äì 1229</ENAMEX>), the Holy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick II</ENAMEX> managed
        to secure <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> by negotiation.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>, however, could not hold the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. After
        they lost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mongol</ENAMEX> invasion swept through, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1244</TIMEX> the
        Mameluke dynasty of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> took control, ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> for the next
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250 years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> struggled to rebuild from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusader</ENAMEX> wars and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasions</ENAMEX>. Much of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> architecture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was
        constructed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mameluke</ENAMEX> era, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past thousand years</TIMEX> had taken
        their toll: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was unable to regain the prosperity it had
        enjoyed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 16th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Turkish Empire</ENAMEX> was
        advancing through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> fell to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1517</TIMEX>, remaining under their control for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years</TIMEX>. Suleiman the
        Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this
        day. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fountains</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>, religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> were constructed.
        But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suleiman</ENAMEX> died, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, began a long
        period of decline. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy City</ENAMEX> remained a backwater until the 19th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, when renewed interest among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX> made it the
        destination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-Century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aspirations</ENAMEX>
        At the same time, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> sought religious freedom and
        fulfillment by moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> (as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX> was traditionally
        called) and especially to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1890s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodor Herzl</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1860‚Äì1904</ENAMEX>) worked to organize a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zionism</ENAMEX>, to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>
        state. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaim Weizmann</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1874‚Äì1952</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> but later
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subject</ENAMEX>, did much to put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herzl‚Äôs</ENAMEX> hopes into practice.
        Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        government that led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Balfour Declaration of 1917</ENAMEX>, supporting the
        idea of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> ‚Äúnational home‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> that also respected the
        rights of existing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">non-Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> already living there. The problem
        was that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX>, who were fighting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, had secretly promised the lands to their <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I Arab</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League of Nations</ENAMEX> granted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> a mandate
        to administer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> flourished during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mandate</ENAMEX>. Modern neighborhoods, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX>
        University were built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> enclave. But
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> opposition to new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> immigration and construction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>
        led to increasing strife; by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was an armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> voted for the partition of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> as an international
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that belonged to neither. But lacking the means to enforce its
        decision, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> was powerless to halt the fighting that
        erupted as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> withdrew their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Israel</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">State of Israel</ENAMEX> was declared during this difficult
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. In response, member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab League</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> to help
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian Arabs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, separated from the rest of the
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, held out under siege for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> until
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> secured a land corridor connecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> areas. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were evacuated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old City‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish Quarter</TIMEX>,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> fled their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. As a
        result of armistice agreements in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was divided: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was to be under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> control, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
        (including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old City</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>, and
        Armenian <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX>) came under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>. Free access to holy
        sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice
        agreements. However, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> partitioned by fortifications and
        barbed wire, no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX> were allowed to visit the
        Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Jerusalem</ENAMEX>.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 19 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Political
        and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of
        terrorism or sniping until the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Six Day War</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1967</TIMEX>. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was completely in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hands</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> it was
        physically and administratively reunited. Jerusalem‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy</ENAMEX>
        Kollek, spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 25 years</TIMEX> orchestrating a vast program of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, adding new cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and instituting
        neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the
        concerns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
        Today, as always, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of controversies:
        religious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> in conflict with secular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX> calling for
        independence; many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> protesting a wave of high-rise development
        that many claim will turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy City</ENAMEX> into a holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">megalopolis</ENAMEX>. But
        the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily
        special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present-day
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> as it continues to tug at the world‚Äôs attention into the new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">millennium</ENAMEX>.
