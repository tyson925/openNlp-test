        WHERE TO GO
        In this sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> of greatest
        interest to foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are remarkably compact. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viejo Madrid</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hapsburgs</ENAMEX>, covers a small area that extends east from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">pitiful R√≠o Manzanares and magnificent Palacio Real</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerta del Sol</ENAMEX>.
        Almost all of it can be covered in a day or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, including a lengthy
        visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon dynasty</ENAMEX>, home to
        Spain‚Äôs great art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, is the next area worthy of exploring (for
        art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>, though, it may very well be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs Golden</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triangle of Art</ENAMEX> is concentrated on the elegant but busy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo del</ENAMEX>
        Prado, between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerta del Sol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Retiro Park</ENAMEX>. Those with more time in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, either before or after side trips to the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of
        Castile, might explore the barrio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salamanca</ENAMEX>, take in a bullfight, or
        visit one or more of the smaller, more personal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, only a ride
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerta del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viejo Madrid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Madrid</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viejo Madrid</ENAMEX>, the area spreading outward from the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Plaza</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>, is the sentimental and geographical heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. After
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> became the seat of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, this area grew rapidly in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th and 17th centuries</TIMEX>. Its cobblestoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are full of
        atmospheric tascas (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tapas bars</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and they contain
        several of the city‚Äôs most important sights, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Palace, Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerta del Sol</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monasterio de las</ENAMEX> Decalzas
        Reales, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>.
        Few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and monuments from medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> exist, but
        the mood still does. It‚Äôs palpable in the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that meander
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX> from the calle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Street</ENAMEX>) and quiet plazas in and around
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Latina</ENAMEX>. Dimly lit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> continue to dispense what they always have:
        books, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, religious statues, and military medals. Outside a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tavern</ENAMEX>
        you may see a waiter pin up a hand-written menu, or a blind
        lottery-ticket seller tapping his white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX> to attract attention,
        reciting the day‚Äôs lucky numbers.
        The porticoed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> (main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>), an architectural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symphony</ENAMEX> in bold but balanced tones, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most
        recognizable sights. Broad arcades surround a cobbled rectangle 200
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meters long and 100 meters</NUMEX> wide (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">656 ft x 328 ft</ENAMEX>). It was built in the
        beginning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, based on the graceful style of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herrera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Escorial</ENAMEX>): symmetry,
        slate roofs, and slender <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> may be entered by any
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archways</ENAMEX>, but mercifully not by motorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>. The square
        was once the scene of pageants, lively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">marketplaces</ENAMEX>, theater festivals,
        bullfights, religious processions, and even trials and executions
        during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Inquisition‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇresidents</ENAMEX> with access to any of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> used to sell tickets for such
        events. A statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe III</ENAMEX>, who ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> to be built,
        occupies the place of honor, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de la Panader√≠a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bakery</ENAMEX>) is
        decorated with colorful frescoes above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>. Even if you‚Äôve only
        just begun your tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> is a great spot for taking in
        the proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most elegant architectural ensemble from a
        seat at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>©s.
        Leading out of each of the arched doorways of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> is a
        maze of small, winding streets‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe most famous of which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cava San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel ‚Äî‚ÄÇlined</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, taverns, and mesones (cave-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>). But
        if you stick to calle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> heading west, you‚Äôll first come to Mercado
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de San Miguel</ENAMEX>, a food and produce market established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX>.
        Farther along c/ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la Villa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall Square</ENAMEX>). This fascinating juxtaposition of stately
        16th- and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> was once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moors‚Äô</ENAMEX> central market
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">square</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic Casa y Torre de los Lujanes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower of the Lujanes</ENAMEX>) has an imposing stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portal</ENAMEX> and mud√©jar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Cisneros</ENAMEX>, on the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, was built in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-16th century</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intrepid inquisitor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardinal Cisneros</ENAMEX>, and is a fine example of the ornate and delicate
        style of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish early Renaissance</TIMEX> architecture known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plateresque</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayuntamiento</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>) building, connected by passageway,
        represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hapsburg</ENAMEX> era, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> and slate spires
        characteristic of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> common in this
        district of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>.
        At the end of c/ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>, just past c/ Bail√©n, is Parque Emir
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mohammed I</ENAMEX>, where you can still see fragments of the old Moorish wall
        that encircled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayerit</ENAMEX> settlement.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of Plaza de la Villa</ENAMEX> and calle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX> is the
        neighborhood called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Latina</ENAMEX> and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Morer√≠a</ENAMEX>,
        where the intense traffic and bustle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> suddenly subsides. The
        quiet and pretty square, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Paja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Straw Square</ENAMEX>), was the
        commercial focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>. On the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">south</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>, with its entrance around the other side, is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de San Andr√©s</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Anthony‚Äôs</ENAMEX>), now splendidly
        restored after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX> of work. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">adjoining chapels</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capilla del</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obis¬≠po</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bishop‚Äôs chapel</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capilla de San Isidro</ENAMEX>, the first Gothic
        and the second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Baroque</ENAMEX>, are also worth a look.
        A formidable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> church of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-18th century</TIMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southwest</ENAMEX> of here, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bas√≠lica de San Francisco El Grande</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basilica of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis of Assisi</ENAMEX>). The curved fa√ßade, an original version of a
        Neo-classical design, somewhat curtails the effect of the church‚Äôs most
        superlative feature, its extraordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>. Indeed, its inner diameter
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 ft</ENAMEX>) exceeds the size of the cupolas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        Paul‚Äôs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Invalides</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>). Oversized statues of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apostles</ENAMEX> in white marble are stationed around the rotunda, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        richly ornamented chapels <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The church‚Äôs
        painting collection includes an early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX>.
        Just east of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza San Andr√©s</ENAMEX> is a jumble of some of
        Madrid‚Äôs most animated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cava Baja</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cava Alta, Almendro</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calle del Nuncio</ENAMEX>, the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Latina</ENAMEX>. Just about every address in
        this district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> an appealing old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tavern</ENAMEX> or tasca. The barrio is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Madrid‚Äôs</ENAMEX> classic working-class areas. The popular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Rastro</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fleamarket</ENAMEX> is held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX> along the warren of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> near calle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Toledo</ENAMEX>, a lively <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> that leads back up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>.
        Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catedral de San Isidro</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1600s</TIMEX> and long
        the provisional cathedral of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, though in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> replete with spectacular cathedrals
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, few are essential sights. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is simply too young a
        city to have a great medieval cathedral. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Isidro</ENAMEX> has a massive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>,
        a single nave and, among many relics, the revered remains of the city‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Isidro Labrador</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palacio Real</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>)
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>, just west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Oriente</ENAMEX>, is
        geographically part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Madrid</ENAMEX>, even if was not built until the 18th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was ordered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bourbon king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe V</ENAMEX> and
        completed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos III</ENAMEX>. Set among formal gardens on a bluff
        overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manzanares valley</ENAMEX>, on the site of the old Moorish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortress</ENAMEX> (which burned down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1734</TIMEX>), the immense and imperious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residence</ENAMEX> is loaded with art and history.
        Guided and self-guided tours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> take in only a
        fraction of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> (more than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>),
        though many of the highlights are visited. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> feature visitors
        see is the immense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Armer√≠a</ENAMEX>, which overlooks the valley west
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. The entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is via the main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">staircase‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbright</ENAMEX>, airy, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ceremonious</ENAMEX> beneath an arched ceiling.
        Each step is a single slab of marble. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥n de los</ENAMEX> Halberdiers
        contains remarkably preserved ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> tapestries.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥n del Trono</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Throne Room</ENAMEX>) occupies the very center of the south
        fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Red velvet and mirrors in matching gilt frames
        cover the walls. The ceiling was painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiepolo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1764</TIMEX>. Gilded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bronze lions</ENAMEX> defend the throne. The conversation antechamber,
        contributed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos III</ENAMEX>, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> portraits.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos III</ENAMEX> consist of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lavish room
        after another. The outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sal√≥n de Gasparini</ENAMEX> is named after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matias Gasparini</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>) that mobilized stone-cutters,
        sculptors, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>-blowers, clock-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX>, sil¬≠versmiths, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet-makers</ENAMEX>,
        and embroiderers to produce this stunning example of rococo. Floor,
        walls, and ceiling swirl with special effects. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala de Porcelana</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porcelain Room</ENAMEX>) is an overwhelming display of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>: more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> pieces from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buen Retiro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">regal</ENAMEX>, extravagant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Comedor de Gala</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceremonial Dining</ENAMEX>
        Room), built for the wedding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XII</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mar√</ENAMEX>≠a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cristina</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1879</TIMEX>, seats <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice the 15</ENAMEX> chandeliers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        candelabra, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain jars</ENAMEX> along walls hung
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX> tapestries.
        After visiting the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botica Real</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Pharmacy</ENAMEX>). Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1594</TIMEX>, the pharmacy‚Äôs cupboards line two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> with matching <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain apothecary</ENAMEX> jars specially
        ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos IV</ENAMEX>. Also part of this annex is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armer√≠a Real</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Armory</ENAMEX>). Swashbuckling swordsmen and jousting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">horsemen</ENAMEX> are
        commemorated here in a display of authentic battle flags, trophies,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shields</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. The armory is officially called the finest
        collection of its type in the world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblioteca Real</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX>) is not generally open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but special access is
        allowed for approved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>.
        Just east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> is the stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de</ENAMEX>
        Oriente, lined with statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and queens, and the Teatro
        Real, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs long-suffering opera <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, it has been beset by all kinds of funding and structural
        problems. It finally reopened, after a decade-long and extravagantly
        budgeted restoration, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> north is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento de la Encarnaci√≥n</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convent of the Incarnation</ENAMEX>), on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> of the same name. Founded in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1611</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margarita de Austria</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> has accumulated an
        interesting art collection, including a gruesome wooden sculpture of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> after his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crucifixion‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbloody</ENAMEX>, blue-lipped, with his eyes
        rolling back into his head. The most fascinating feature, though, is
        the reliquary, lined with religious relics, some also rather macabre.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, you may hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nuns</ENAMEX> praying or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">singing</ENAMEX>, but you‚Äôll never see them; they are cloistered on the other
        side of the grillwork.
        Nearby (and possible to visit on a joint ticket with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convento de la Incarnaci√≥n</ENAMEX>) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monasterio de Las Descalzas</ENAMEX> Reales
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monastery</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barefoot Royal Ladies</ENAMEX>). Though one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs top
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sights</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> still miss it. The former medieval palace clings
        to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tranquillity</ENAMEX>. Founded by princess <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juana de Austria</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos V</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1566</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was
        transformed into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escorial</ENAMEX>. Subsidized by generous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> accepted only
        nuns of the highest nobility until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 18th century</TIMEX>.
        The wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> brought with them spectacular works of art and
        statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>. Cloistered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> nuns‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa maximum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        (the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> when he died) but today far fewer‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇremain</ENAMEX> on the
        premises but stay out of sight during visiting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> was completely cloistered‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇno visits allowed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visitors‚Äô</ENAMEX> first views of the convent‚Äôs splendor begin with
        the theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite stairway</ENAMEX>, splashed with splendid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX>
        frescoes from floor to ceiling. Above the stairway leading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX> is
        a depiction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe IV</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> are heavy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">timbered</ENAMEX> ceilings and walls covered with works of art, mostly of
        religious or royal significance. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, there are a dozen
        splendid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> tapestries based on original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> drawings. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> contains outstanding paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brueghel the Elder</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zurbar√°n.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent church</ENAMEX> is particularly well

        Near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerta del Sol</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerta del Sol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gateway</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>) is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs busiest

        it marks the transition between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hapsburg Madrid</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> expansion
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>. The original gate that once existed here‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpart

        The no-nonsense, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neo</ENAMEX>-classical building on the south side
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Correos</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the regional

        building strikes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>, after which pandemonium breaks out.
        Facing all the bustle of a remodeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerta del Sol</ENAMEX> is a
        statue based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, which depicts a bear leaning
        against a madro√±o <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> (an arbutus, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bear</ENAMEX> is a
        symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√≠o Pepe</ENAMEX> sign, an advertisement for one of
        Spain‚Äôs most famous brands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sherry</ENAMEX>, has become the unofficial symbol
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerta del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX>.
        Just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerta del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> and next door to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇcall it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Royal Academy</ENAMEX>. It possesses a

        Sardine, and a superb self-portrait of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> in his old age.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vel√°zquez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murillo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> are also represented among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
        of works on display. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Academy</ENAMEX> also has a magnificent
        collection of paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zurbar√°n</ENAMEX>, rivaling that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado Museum</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Representative</ENAMEX> of the artist‚Äôs austere, devotional style is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision of</ENAMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Blessed Alonso Rodr√≠guez</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerta del Sol</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza Santa Ana</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huertas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, both of which are chock full of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, tascas
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tapas bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, and live music and flamenco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>. The area
        really springs to life at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West of Puerta del</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sol</ENAMEX> is the city‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> expansion
        engineered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon monarchs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle de Alcal√</ENAMEX>° merges with Gran
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V√≠a</ENAMEX> and leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Cibeles</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo del Prado</ENAMEX>,with
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> of art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. The area‚Äôs spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevards</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grand plazas</ENAMEX>,
        and fountains are interspersed with densely populated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX>
        apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. After hitting the art world‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Big Three</ENAMEX>, visitors
        can repair to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Retiro Park</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> once found respite from the
        demands of hectic city life.
        Except for the traffic spitting out noise and air
        pollution, the ample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Cibeles</ENAMEX> is splendid. The central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fountain</ENAMEX> depicts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cybele</ENAMEX>, a controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> fertility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serenely</ENAMEX> settled in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chariot</ENAMEX> pulled by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>. The sculptural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ensemble</ENAMEX> is probably the best-known fountain in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The most
        unavoidable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> is the cathedral-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de</ENAMEX>
        Comunicaciones, teasingly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nicknamed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuestra Se√±ora de las</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comunicaciones</ENAMEX> (Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications</ENAMEX>). Inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>, the
        building is the quite remarkable central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>, with high
        ceilings and overhead walkways.
        Also facing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Cibeles</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banco de Espa√±a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> combines Neo-classical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX>, and rococo
        styles. The financial district, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs Wall Street, begins here on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calle de Alcal√°.</ENAMEX> Imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in this high-rent district contain
        the head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, plus insurance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, the finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX>, and on nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaza de la Lealtad</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolsa de Comercio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock E</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">xchange</ENAMEX>). Heading down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">leafy</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo del Prado</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and greatest, of the art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> here.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo del Prado</ENAMEX>
        Madrid‚Äôs pride, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, is indisputably the
        world‚Äôs greatest collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> paintings and one of the world‚Äôs
        most prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. Even apart from its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> treasures, it
        deserves high priority on any visitor‚Äôs agenda for its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
        famous foreign works, especially of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.
        This immense hoard of art works, ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th</TIMEX> to the 19th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, was collected and donated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs Hapsburg and Bourbon</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kings</ENAMEX>, private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> of the arts, and convents and monasteries around
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        Despite its greatness, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> came about somewhat by
        chance. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos III</ENAMEX> commissioned the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">architect Juan de Villanueva</ENAMEX>, draftsman of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, to design
        this Neo-classical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. It was to have serv¬≠ed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of
        natural history, but after some eventful delays (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> invasion
        badly damaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>), its mission was diverted to art, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of painting was inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX> it became <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mu¬≠seo del Prado</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>, modernization projects, such as
        desperately needed air conditioning and humidity control, caused
        upheaval in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. Although these are now completed, further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">renovation</ENAMEX> and work on an extension are underway. The famed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">architect Rafael Moneo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> prize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>, is set to begin the
        Prado‚Äôs long-awaited expansion so that more of its vast collection can
        be exhibited.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> owns perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> paintings, but at present can
        only display <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 10 percent</NUMEX> of them (the overflow is either in
        storage or on loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> around the world. ) Seeing and
        appreciating even that many great paintings could occupy a serious
        student of art for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many weeks</TIMEX>. Short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> may have to settle
        for the condensed highlights, perhaps in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hectic couple of hours</TIMEX>.
        To take in more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Masters</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile</NUMEX>, it‚Äôs vital to plan
        ahead. Decide what you want to see and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for it <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, even if it
        demands that you rush past obvious masterworks. Given the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>,
        you‚Äôd be wise to rest your feet from time to time, or seek refreshment
        in the basement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>.
        Highlights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado Museum</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>: Alongside modern master <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pablo Picasso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diego</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vel√°zquez y Silva</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1599‚Äì1660</ENAMEX>) is the most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> who
        ever lived. He was hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe IV</ENAMEX> and became an amazingly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perceptive</ENAMEX> court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> and, quite simply, the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>. The royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is featured in his seminal work,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Meninas</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maids of Honor</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> painted himself with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palette</ENAMEX> in hand at the left side of his own masterpiece, in a sense
        part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, as he became in real life.
        Another vast, unforgettable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vel√</ENAMEX>°zquez canvas here is
        Surrender of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breda</ENAMEX>, commemorating a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> forces
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1625</TIMEX>. The chivalry of the winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX>, the exhaustion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loser</ENAMEX>, the less disguised emotions of their retinues, the array of
        upraised lances, and the burning landscape communicated a profound
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathos</ENAMEX>. Elsewhere are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vel√</ENAMEX>°zquez‚Äôs portraits of the high and the mighty,
        along with studies of fun-loving, ordinary mortals. Other great works
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las Hilanderas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Spinners</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Borrachos</ENAMEX> (The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drunkards</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco de Goya</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1746‚Äì1828</ENAMEX>), another court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, had a
        tumultuous, wildly varied career, and excellent selections from nearly
        every phase of it are collected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX>, which has the largest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> ensemble in the world. A philanderer in his youth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> fled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zaragoza</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1763</TIMEX> for the anonymity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. He went on to become the
        king‚Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>. Of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado‚</ENAMEX>Äôs paintings, none is more
        discussed and disputed than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Maja Desnuda</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Naked Maja</ENAMEX>), one of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first nudes. Rumors of a scandalous affair between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duchess of Alba</ENAMEX> have long been assumed. Goya‚Äôs most celebrated royal
        portrait, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos IV</ENAMEX>, is daringly frank and unflattering;
        only the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> look remotely attractive. On still another
        level, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Executions of the 3rd</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, one of history‚Äôs most powerful
        protest pictures, depicts the shooting of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patriots</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1808</TIMEX> by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> witnessed this tragedy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX> from
        his cottage, then went to the scene by moonlight to sketch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Goya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> were opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1999</TIMEX>. Goya‚Äôs harrowing
        ‚Äúblack paintings,‚Äù done when he was depressed and going deaf (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn Devouring One</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">His Sons</ENAMEX>) have been moved, temporarily, from

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prado‚Äôs</ENAMEX> planned expansion.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1541‚Äì1614</ENAMEX>) was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX> and was long a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, but nonetheless became a consummate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>.
        He worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>, his adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 years</TIMEX>, toiling away at
        the immense and intensely personal religious canvases that are his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hallmark</ENAMEX>. Asymmetrical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX> and a mystical mood of ecstasy
        typify his work. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Knight</ENAMEX> with his Hand on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chest</ENAMEX>, an early portrait, is
        realistic and alive, a study of a deep-eyed, bearded caballero
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gentleman</NUMEX>) in black. It is signed, in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> letters, ‚ÄúDomenikos
        Theotokopoulos,‚Äù the artist‚Äôs real name. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> is also well
        supplied with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs passionately colored religious paintings, such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adoration of the Shepherds</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX> didn‚Äôt care for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        revolutionary style, and later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> wondered whether his elongated
        figures were the result of myopia, but his mystical masterpieces live
        on.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco de Zurbar√°n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1598‚Äì1664</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seville</ENAMEX>
        school, combined mysticism and realism and was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of light. His
        greatest works are of mythological, religious and historic themes. His
        deeply religious monks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> are painted in flowing
        robes with almost tangible textures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> owns his strained but
        fascinating battle picture, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Defense of C√°diz</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>,
        and the rarer Still Life of a goblet, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> vases, and a pot emerging
        from a black background.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartolom√© Murillo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1617‚Äì1682</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular
        religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> of his time, depicted revered Biblical personalities
        at ease. His tender scenes, as well as classical religious works with
        soaring angels, brought Murillo international fame, although detractors
        label his later work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mawkish</ENAMEX> and saccharine.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√© Ribera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1591‚Äì1652</ENAMEX>) spent much of his life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>,
        where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spagnoletto</ENAMEX> (the little
        Spaniard). His portraits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, hermits, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyrs</ENAMEX> reveal
        impeccable drawing skills, composition, and keen exploitation of light
        and shadow.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hieronymus Bosch</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1450‚Äì1516</ENAMEX>), whom
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> call <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El Bosco</ENAMEX>, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> masterpieces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX>,
        including a large triptych called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Garden of Earthly Delights</ENAMEX>.
        Daringly mixing erotic fantasies and apocalyptic nightmares, it
        portrays the terrors and superstitions of the medieval peasant mind.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosch‚Äôs</ENAMEX> wild hallucinations presage similar psychological explorations
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years later</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvador Dal√≠</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Paul Rubens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1577‚Äì1640</ENAMEX>), of noble ancestry, pursued a
        career as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> as well as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>. The prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> is
        represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of paintings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX>. Of particular note is
        the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adoration of the Magi</ENAMEX>, a brilliant religious extravaganza, and
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Three Graces</ENAMEX>, a portrait of fleshy nudes with an equally lush
        landscape. The blonde on the left is said to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubens‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helena</ENAMEX>.
        The greatest work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogier van der Weyden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1400‚Äì 1464</ENAMEX>),
        Descent From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>, an altarpiece, should not be missed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titian</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1490‚Äì1576</ENAMEX>) is represented by several

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos V. Depicting Titian‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> in armor, on horseback at the

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titian</ENAMEX> also produced religious works, but seemed to have
        no difficulty changing gears to the downright lascivious: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baccanal</ENAMEX> is
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> as far as an orgy can go within the bounds of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
        The collection of paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1483‚Äì1520</ENAMEX>) in the
        Prado was once kidnapped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> and carted off to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, though
        soon recovered. Centuries of investigation have failed to uncover the

        quite another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, the close-up of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lady Revealing her Bosom</ENAMEX>. On
        your way through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, be sure to keep an eye peeled for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fra Angelico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs glowing and stupendous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annunciation</ENAMEX>, as well as for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonello da Messina‚</ENAMEX>Äôs realistically detailed, intensely tragic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>

        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> annex, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cas√≥n del Buen Retiro</ENAMEX>, up the hill in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calle de Felipe IV</ENAMEX>, houses a collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> paintings, but
        remained closed for renovations in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>.
        Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo del Prado</ENAMEX> is the Museo
        Thyssen-Bor¬≠nemizsa, a recent addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚Äôs</ENAMEX> already impressive
        art collections housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de Villahermosa</ENAMEX>. This elegant
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> has been specifically renovated to house one
        of the largest known private collections of ancient and modern
        paintings, the property of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialist Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von</ENAMEX>
        Thyssen-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bornemizsa</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 800</NUMEX> paintings are exhibited, dating from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX> to the present day. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the 19th and 20th</TIMEX> centuries
        there are examples of trends such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, German
        expressionism, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> abstract painting.
        Like a survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> art, among the most important collections are
        classical works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fra Ang√©lico, Van Eyck, D√ºrer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt, Hals</ENAMEX>,
        Titian, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Dyck</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, and Impressionist works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monet</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renoir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaugain, Toulouse-Lautrec, C√©zanne</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX>, among many
        others. An impressive private collection it certainly is, but there are
        those who have criticized it as an ostentatious collection of minor
        works by major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> anchor in the golden art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX>, a landmark of old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital de San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> (c/ <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa I¬</ENAMEX>≠sa¬<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">≠bel 52</NUMEX>), which now
        houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> focuses on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX>
        and international <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th- century</TIMEX> art, and is best known for exhibiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pi¬≠ca¬≠sso‚Äôs monumental ¬≠Guer¬</ENAMEX>≠nica behind bulletproof glass. Held in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> until the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>, per the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artist‚Äôs</ENAMEX> wishes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guernica</ENAMEX>, a panorama of horror provoked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
        Civil <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> bombing of a defenseless <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Basque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, is perhaps the 20th
        century‚Äôs most famous painting. On display alongside are the original
        sketches and studies showing the work that went into the final canvas.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> also houses other paintings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pi¬≠casso</ENAMEX>, as well as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opulent</ENAMEX> collection of works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mir√≥, Dal√≠</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julio Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gris</ENAMEX>.
        Directly across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reina Sof√</ENAMEX>≠a is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atocha</ENAMEX> train
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>, an iron-and-glass affair with a small botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> inside.
        If you want to catch the high-speed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seville</ENAMEX>,
        or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, this is where you‚Äôll need to go.
        South¬≠east of the train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Real F√°brica de Ta¬≠pi¬≠ces</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tapestry Factory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">c/ Fuenterrab√≠a</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). All that has changed since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe V</ENAMEX> found¬≠ed this workshop in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1721</TIMEX> is the method of dyeing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>. The same <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> looms are still used, though the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> has dwindled considerably. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> worked here, creating the
        designs on which tapestries were based. They are still being copied,
        along with contemporary designs, on commission.
        Immediately east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del Prado</ENAMEX> is the city‚Äôs major
        green space, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque del Buen Retiro</ENAMEX>. Until a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">little more than a century</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Retiro Park</ENAMEX> was a royal preserve. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX>, gardens and
        promenades are the most convenient and enjoyable place for many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrile√±os</ENAMEX> to take a family outing (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers rent rowboats</ENAMEX> and paddle about the small lake in the center of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palacio de Cristal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crystal Palace</ENAMEX>), a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> iron
        and glass solarium that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> temporary art exhibitions, has finally
        reopened after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of renovations.
        Another central breathing space, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real Jard√≠n Bot√</ENAMEX>°nico
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Royal Botanical Garden</ENAMEX>), adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX>, was founded two
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX> and is packed with enlightening displays of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
        At the northwest corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Retiro Park</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerta de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al¬≠ca¬≠l√°</ENAMEX>, a monumental triumphal arch surmounted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX>-angels,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">honoring Carlos III</ENAMEX>. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19th century</TIMEX>, this marked the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eastern</ENAMEX> edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Independencia</ENAMEX>, in which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arch</ENAMEX> stands, is a bedlam of midtown traffic and gateway to newer
        barrios east.
        Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>
        Madrid‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> major expansion took place in the 19th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, resulting in the foundations of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, a sprawling
        succession of residential neighborhoods, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, cinemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrio de Salamanca</ENAMEX> is the most attractive
        and exclusive of these, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran V√</ENAMEX>≠a is the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avenue</ENAMEX> that connects <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> to west, old to new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo de Recoletos</ENAMEX> is a continuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo del Prado</ENAMEX>
        that runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de la Cibeles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza Col√≥n</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> east is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinguished Museo Arqueol√≥gico</ENAMEX> (c/ Serrano, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>). The museum‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">archaeology</ENAMEX> collection addresses the art of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, with statuettes and jewelry from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2nd-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c. Carthaginian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> and miraculously preserved mosaics from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2nd-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.d. Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. An unforgettable item is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Dama de Elche</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elche</ENAMEX>), a

        prehistoric depictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, dating back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15,000 years</TIMEX> and
        representing man‚Äôs first illustrations of the world around him. They
        are said to be some of the finest prehistoric cave drawings ever
        discovered.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza de Col√≥n</ENAMEX> is a large open space that has been the
        recent scene of far-reaching public-works projects. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> airport
        bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> operates below ground, beneath an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX> statue of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> and a monument to the discovery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>.
        There is also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro Cultural de la Villa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Cultural Center</ENAMEX>),
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for concerts, theatre, art exhibitions, and films.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo de la Castellana</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs principal north-south
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avenue</ENAMEX>, running for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several miles</NUMEX> through the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and
        bordering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salamanca</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> to its west. In the area north of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaza de Col√≥n</ENAMEX>, you come to a newer section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, where patrician
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">townhouses</ENAMEX> in the central area give way to luxurious modern apartment
        blocks with landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo L√°zaro Galdiano</ENAMEX> (c/ Serrano, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX>) is an astonishingly

        they were married; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hieronymus Bosch</ENAMEX> at his most diabolical; a rich
        repository of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> portraits, colorful sketches of real life,
        and haunting scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witches</ENAMEX> and horrors; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assisi</ENAMEX> and an early (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1562</TIMEX>) picture from his <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Venetian</ENAMEX> period;

        museum‚Äôs greatest pride, spotlighted in its own niche on the ground
        floor, is a portrait of angelic beauty, painted around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1480</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da Vinci</ENAMEX>, entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Saviour</ENAMEX>.
        Another smaller but equally interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is the Museo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorolla</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo del General Mart√</ENAMEX>≠nez <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Campos</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>). The only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        devoted to a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> was the hom e and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaqu√≠n Sorolla</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1863‚Äì1923</ENAMEX>). It has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">close to 300</NUMEX> paintings on view,
        showing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valencian</ENAMEX> impressionist‚Äôs favorite seaside scenes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landscapes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has a charming lived-in feel.
        Quite a way east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salamanca</ENAMEX> barrio is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toros y Museo Taurino</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bullfighting Ring and Museum</ENAMEX>), officially called
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Toros Monumental de Las Ventas</ENAMEX>. This is where to go to see
        an authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bullfight</ENAMEX>, a seemingly anachronistic pursuit that
        continues to inspire the passions of so many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Madrile√±os</ENAMEX>. The small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> houses historic posters, capes, swords, paintings, and photos
        for aficionados of the corrida, and is perhaps best visited out of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bullfighting</TIMEX> season for those who want to get a glimpse of the interior
        of the ring.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gran V√≠a & Plaza de Espa√±a</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bustling Gran V√</ENAMEX>≠a is a mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, theatres,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nightclubs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caf√©s‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe street</ENAMEX> for strolling and window-gazing.
        Connoisseurs of traffic jams will appreciate the nightmarish <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX>
        along this busy street. Pony-tailed policewomen frantically gesticulate
        and whistle in a doomed effort to stir the immovable traffic; drivers
        at their wit‚Äôs end lean on their horns in sympathy and add to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cacophony</ENAMEX>. And a special bonus: In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, thanks to the siesta lunch
        break, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX> happens not twice, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a day.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> is a busy mix of architectural styles and
        contains several fine examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Art Nouveau and Art Deco</ENAMEX>.
        Particularly noteworthy are the ornately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Edificio Metr√≥polis</ENAMEX>, at
        the junction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcal√°</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de la M√∫sica</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza del</ENAMEX>
        Callao, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran V√≠a</ENAMEX> continues downhill towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Espa√±a</ENAMEX>
        through more shopping, strolling, and nightlife territory. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> tall
        skyscrapers dominate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>. A favorite sight with visiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photographers</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cervantes</ENAMEX> monument: A stone sculpture honoring the
        author looms behind bronze statues of his immortal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quixote</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sancho Panza</ENAMEX>, astride their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and donkey,
        respectively.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museo Cerralbo</ENAMEX> (c/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ven¬≠tu¬≠ra Rodr√≠guez</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>), another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nobleman‚Äôs</ENAMEX> collection bequeathed to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, is more like visiting
        an art collector‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>; few works are
        identified or marked. But there are paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco, Murillo</ENAMEX>,
        Ribera, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Zur¬≠ba¬≠r√°n</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Titian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ca¬≠ra¬≠va¬≠g¬≠¬≠g¬≠io</ENAMEX>. The mansion‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">split-level</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> would make any bibliophile jealous.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parque del Oeste</ENAMEX> is a true curiosity, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TemploE¬≠gip¬≠cio de Debod</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Threat¬≠en¬≠¬≠ed</ENAMEX> with submersion during the
        building of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aswan</ENAMEX> high <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>, this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25-century</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was
        dismantled and shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, stone by stone, as a gift to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The sight from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is also something
        special: a panoramic view over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calle de la Princesa</ENAMEX>, which begins at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Espa√±a</ENAMEX>, is
        actually a northwest extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran V√≠a.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> is
        literally palatial, calling to mind a scaled-down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckingham Palace</ENAMEX>.
        Tucked away in a comfortable park behind high railings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liria</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the duchess of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alba</ENAMEX>. The family picture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> includes works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt, Titian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Dyck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX>
        Greco, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is closed to the public except by
        special arrangement.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle de la Princesa‚</ENAMEX>Äôs trajectory ends where the university
        district begins. The landmarks are the air force <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> (a modern
        copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Escorial</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs youngest triumphal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>, which
        commemorates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> victory of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>.
        Aficionados of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> art and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> in particular should
        not miss <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Ermita de San Antonio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de la Florida</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glorieta de San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio de la</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In an area between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway yards</ENAMEX> and the
        river, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest frescoes, remarkably preserved, cover the cupola
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artist‚Äôs tomb</ENAMEX> was installed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>. An identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chapel</ENAMEX> was built alongside this one in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya‚</ENAMEX>Äôs frescoes and remains could rest in relative
        peace.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ciudad Universitaria</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University City</ENAMEX>, was built on the
        ruins of the district that suffered the worst damage in the civil war.
        A drive around indicates the ambitious expanse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> and the
        mixture of architectural styles.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Am√©rica</ENAMEX>, which in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>. There are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pre-Columbian</ENAMEX> pieces from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rare <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mayan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manuscripts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c√≥¬≠di¬≠ces</ENAMEX>), replete with the mysterious symbols and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque Casa de Campo</ENAMEX> is another former royal preserve,
        forested by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1559</TIMEX>. It can be reached by bus, suburban

        If you make only a single side trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, the
        legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>, home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Middle Ages</TIMEX> melting
        pot of diverse cultures, should be the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. A survey of the history of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇits</ENAMEX> tradition, grandeur, art, architecture and mix of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis</ENAMEX> crammed into this small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Castilian hilltop</ENAMEX>. The
        one-time imperial capital remains the religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and an
        incomparable treasure-trove of fine arts. You are more than likely to
        get lost exploring the tiny back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, little changed since the 16th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, but you‚Äôll never forget the adventure.
        Successively conquered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visigoths</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>
        became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1085</TIMEX>. Until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Reconquest</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toledo</ENAMEX> was a place of religious and cultural harmony. Even though the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were expelled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> remains alive with
        their remarkable contributions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is a fascinating and congested
        labyrinth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, synagogues, mosques, noble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and humble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residences</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catedral de Toledo</ENAMEX>, right in the center of the old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most recognized and spectacular sights‚ÄÇ‚Äî it is
        visible from any part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, thanks to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> topped by a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spire</ENAMEX> ringed by spikes. At ground level, the asymmetrical cathedral is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemmed</ENAMEX> in by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">To¬</ENAMEX>≠le¬≠do‚Äôs clutter of back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, making it difficult to
        position yourself for a sufficiently dramatic view. Even so, its
        abundant glory is immediately apprehended <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inside‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe stained glass</ENAMEX>,
        wrought iron, sculpture, and paintings are by a stable of many of
        Spain‚Äôs greatest geniuses.
        Toledo‚Äôs eminence as the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Spain</ENAMEX> dates to
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> synods and ecclesiastical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">councils</ENAMEX> held there as early as the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 400</TIMEX>. But with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">711</TIMEX>, Christianity
        went underground. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1085</TIMEX>, with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legendary warrior El Cid</ENAMEX> leading the way, mosques were converted into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1222</TIMEX>, funds were appropriated for a fitting cathedral. The
        construction lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two and a half</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>; the ornamentation took
        considerably longer.
        In the center of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-aisled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> basilica, the Coro
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>) is a marvel of woodcarving. Illustrations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
        triumph at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>, on the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> stalls, were created by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodrigo Alem√</ENAMEX>°n <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only three years</TIMEX> after the great event itself. The
        higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, carved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> masters <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alonso</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berruguete</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe Bigarny</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">13th</NUMEX>- or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> smiling statue
        known as The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">White Virgin</ENAMEX> is believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.
        Across the transept, though, the main altar outdoes the
        coro‚Äôs splendor. A magnificent polychrome retablo, rising in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
        tiers, depicts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Testament</ENAMEX> stories in fervent detail. Just behind the
        back wall of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Trans¬≠pa¬≠ren¬≠te</ENAMEX> is the cathedral‚Äôs
        most unforgettable innovation. The fantastically elaborate work is by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narciso Tom√©</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, sculptor, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>. The
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> open¬≠ed the cathedral‚Äôs ceiling to draw light into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, at the same time leading the eyes of worshippers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heavenwards</ENAMEX>. The cathedral‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äôs 750</NUMEX> stained-glass windows are sublimely
        restrained, but <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">To¬≠m√©‚Äôs bronze</ENAMEX>, marble, and jasper ensemble of color,
        shape, and symbolism is startling, and, daring as it is, much
        criticized.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala Capitular</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chap¬≠¬≠ter House</ENAMEX>) is a strangely
        oriental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with an intricate ceiling in the style called mud√©jar
        (the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> performed for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>). On
        the walls are portraits of the archbishops of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>, beginning with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Eugene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 96</ENAMEX>) and including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cardinal Cisneros</ENAMEX>, who ordered the
        construction of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tesoro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>), reliquaries, chalices, and crowns
        take a back seat to the lavish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">monstrance</ENAMEX> (also ordered by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cisneros</ENAMEX>). This towering vessel, comprising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,600</NUMEX> individual parts and
        subsequently gilded, was the work of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> silversmith Heinrich
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Harff</ENAMEX>. Precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> add to the glitter. The monstrance is said
        to weigh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 arrobas</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over 440 pounds</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacrist√≠a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacristy</ENAMEX>) is an art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Grecos</ENAMEX> in this small collection. In addition
        to portraits of the virgin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> on the cross, and the apostles,
        there is a large and outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX> work over the main altar of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sacristy‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇExpolio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Denuding of Christ</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sacristy</ENAMEX> also
        displays first-rate paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Titian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vel√°zquez.</ENAMEX>
        The cathedral‚Äôs only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> for domination of the
        Toledo skyline is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°zar</ENAMEX>, a fortress destroyed and rebuilt many
        times. It began as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> redoubt, but its present style was devised
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. Since then it has been used as a royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>,
        army <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">post</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX>, it was a
        stronghold of the pro-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> forces, who held out during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72-day</TIMEX> siege
        that all but destroyed it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalist commandant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√</ENAMEX>©
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moscard√≥ Ituarte</ENAMEX>, received a telephone call from the enemy announcing
        that his son, held hostage, would be executed unless the fortress
        surrendered. In a supremely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> reply, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonel</ENAMEX> advised his son
        to ‚Äúpray, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shout ‚ÄòViva Espa√±a‚Äô</ENAMEX> and die like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù More than a month
        after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> was killed, the siege was lifted. The citadel now holds
        an only moderately interesting military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
        The triangular-shaped main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> has also been
        rebuilt after civil war destruction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de Zocodover</ENAMEX> is where
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> market (zoco) was held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>. It was also the
        scene of the great fiestas, tournaments, and executions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>
        and infidels. Suggestively, the horseshoe arch leading from the square
        towards the river is called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Arco de Sangre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arch of Blood</ENAMEX>).
        Just down the hill beyond the arch, on calle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Cervantes</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Museo de Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Holy Cross</ENAMEX>) is housed in the
        sumptuous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> Hospital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Cross</ENAMEX>, as notable as the
        contents within. The main portal is of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> carved in the style called
        plateresque, because it seems as delicate as a silversmith‚Äôs work
        (platero means silversmith). Inside, great wooden ceilings add to a
        feeling of opulent spaciousness. The provincial archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        is housed here, but greater interest accrues to the art collection. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> are in for a happy surprise‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa wide selection of his works,
        highlighted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Asunci√≥n de la Virgen</ENAMEX>, painted just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> before
        the artist‚Äôs death. Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> are superb <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tapestries</ENAMEX>, furniture and decorative arts.
        The parish church <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iglesia de Santo Tom√</ENAMEX>© is a landmark
        because of its stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mud√©jar tower</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors crowd</ENAMEX> into a small
        annex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with one intent: to view a single painting, one of
        Spain‚Äôs supreme masterpieces, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Greco‚Äôs Burial of the Count of Orgaz</ENAMEX>.
        The spectacular, large canvas, the single most famous image of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>,
        fuses the mundane and the spiritual, depicting grave-faced local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noblemen</ENAMEX> attending the count‚Äôs funeral. Tradition says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> made
        an appearance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco</ENAMEX> shows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Augustine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>, in splendid ecclesiastical garb, lifting the count‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>.
        Above, angels and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints crowd</ENAMEX> the clouds. The whole story is told in
        perfect pictorial balance, and with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs penchant for long,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heaven-gazing</ENAMEX> faces and characteristic colors.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco</ENAMEX> spent the most productive years of his prolific
        career in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>. Just down the hill from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santo Tom√©</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa-Museo El</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Greco‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmisleadingly</ENAMEX> named, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> almost certainly never
        lived in it‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhas been reconstructed and linked to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> dedicated
        to his life. Still, it has authentic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> furnishings and a
        tranquil garden that at the least replicate the look and feel of a
        Toledan <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>. Several of the master‚Äôs paintings are on
        display, among them A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">View</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Portrait of St. Peter</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El</ENAMEX>
        Greco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was originally built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samuel Levi</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King Peter I of Castile</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From the 12th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th centuries</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish poets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moors</ENAMEX>, and
        Benedictine monks worked alongside each other in translation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. As
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> awakened from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dark Ages</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> provided a key link in
        transmitting vital knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> science and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> philosophy to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> world.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those halcyon days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samuel Levi</ENAMEX>, as devout as he was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX>, built a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> next to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinagoga del Tr√</ENAMEX>°nsito
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synagogue of the Dormition</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> created a ceiling of cedar
        imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>; they adorned the walls with filigrees of
        impressive intricacy, as well as inscriptions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">psalms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Upstairs</ENAMEX>, a large gallery was reserved for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX>. Curiously, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tombstones</ENAMEX> are found in the floor;
        after the expulsion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> was converted
        into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Sefard√≠</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephardic Museum</ENAMEX>) is attached
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Levi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>, with exhibits of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medieval tombs</ENAMEX>, scrolls,
        and vestments.
        Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tr√°nsito</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinagoga de Santa Mar√≠a la Blanca</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synagogue of St. Mary the White</ENAMEX>) received its present name after being
        converted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. No signs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> presence remain, yet this
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-aisled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> columns supporting horseshoe arches, was
        the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>. Much more apparent is its
        Muslim connection; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was constructed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> artisans and
        looks much more like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. In the 15th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, bloodthirsty mobs raided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> and massacred the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. After the pogrom, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> served a bizarre
        variety of purposes‚<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇas a Catholic chapel</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> for ‚Äúfallen‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, army <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>, and quartermaster‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depot</ENAMEX>. Even empty, as it is
        now, it still evokes dramatic memories.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monastery of St. John</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX>), built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monarchs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isabella</ENAMEX>
        from their private fortune, in commemoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1476</ENAMEX> victory over
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> in the battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toro</ENAMEX>. mud√©jar elements, it maintains a
        poignant souvenir on the outer wall‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> that held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. The spectacular cloister is a superb example of
        mostly late-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> style, with elaborate stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX>.
        The main entrance into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>, between the ‚Äúnew‚Äù
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> gateway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerta Nueva de Bisagra</ENAMEX> and the bullring, stands
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital de Tavera‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇequal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parts palace</ENAMEX>, orphanage, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">church‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbuilt</ENAMEX> by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archbishop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Juan Pardo de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tavera</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> contains fascinating old manuscripts as well as the
        bound volumes of the hospital‚Äôs financial accounts, which record
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ex¬≠pend¬≠¬≠itures</ENAMEX> in a meticulous script. In the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> hangs a
        portrait by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titian</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos V</ENAMEX> and a painting of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">princess Clara Eugenia</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio Coello</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX> is also strongly
        represented elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. His portrait of the Virgin is
        stirringly beautiful, while <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Baptism of Christ</ENAMEX> is one of the artist‚Äôs
        last works. A curiosity here is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribera‚</ENAMEX>Äôs portrait of a bearded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> the small statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> resurrected, an experiment in
        sculpture by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX>.
        A fine view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Toledo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇstill very similar to the one
        painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco</ENAMEX> of his beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">city‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇcan be had just across the
        river, north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. By <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, the drive along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carretera de</ENAMEX>
        Circunvalaci√≥n, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beltway</ENAMEX> that parallels the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Tagus</ENAMEX> around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, leads towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parador</ENAMEX> hotel and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puente de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°ntara.</ENAMEX> The views are stupendous, especially at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX>
        without access to an automobile seeking a similar view should walk out
        through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mart√≠n</ENAMEX> neighborhood, west of the old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jewish quarter</TIMEX>,
        over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Mart√≠n bridge</ENAMEX> (which dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1203</TIMEX>), behind which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>
        rises dramatically on the hill.
        If you‚Äôre driving back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> and want to
        make a brief stop almost exactly mid-way, the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illescas</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km/20 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>) holds a surprise, especially for art
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aficionados</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hospital de la Virgen de la Caridad</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convent</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin of Charity</ENAMEX>), has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Grecos</ENAMEX> hanging in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.

        The deep-green water of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R√≠o Tajo</ENAMEX>, reflecting the noble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aranjuez</ENAMEX>, nourishes <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and formal gardens, as well as
        the prized local <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> can be
        reached by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">picturesque ‚ÄúStrawberry Train‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tren de la Fresa</ENAMEX>), which

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evening</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>.
        As you cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aranjuez</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, the spacious, geometric <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> plan becomes apparent. The

        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Anthony</ENAMEX> at the south end.
        But here the civic sights take <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> place to the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">palaces</ENAMEX>. Ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monarchs</ENAMEX> have
        retreated to this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX> to escape <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer</TIMEX> heat. Since the 18th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, they‚Äôve enjoyed the luxury of a first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">country palace</ENAMEX>
        reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>, a railway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> ran
        into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palacio Real</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>) to the foot of the staircase.
        Guided tours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> cover <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>, enough to
        reveal a cross-section of royal taste in furniture, paintings,
        sculpture, tapestries, clocks, pianos, music-boxes, and bric-a-brac.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Porcelain Room</ENAMEX> contains decorations created by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buen</ENAMEX> Retiro
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos III</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1760</TIMEX>. The walls are
        covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> figures telling exotic stories: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samurai</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mandarins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> mirrors, a weird
        porcelain chandelier, a circular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX>, and a fine marble floor
        complete the dazzling design. In the Smoking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Room</ENAMEX>, based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alhambra</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, red damask couches sprawl
        along the walls of this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-19th-century</TIMEX> reproduction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        painting salon holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ingenious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>-paper paintings, gifts from a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>.
        A combined ticket covers all the sights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. Less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile</NUMEX>) from the royal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX>, the curiously named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cottage (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la casita del labrador</ENAMEX>)
        is set in the extensive prince‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>. Far from being a cottage, this
        is a condensed palace to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> retreated for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and
        hunting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>.
        Busts of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> give the statue gallery its
        name, but the big attraction is what first seems to be a far-fetched
        fountain in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. It turns out instead to be a
        far-fetched clock, an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX> folly, incorporating simulated water jets
        and a large music box. This being an informal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ballroom</ENAMEX> is
        barely large enough to accommodate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> noble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Platinum</ENAMEX>
        Room, as sumptuous as it sounds, leads to the king‚Äôs own toilet,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wittily</ENAMEX> arranged as a plush throne.
        Elsewhere in the prince‚Äôs garden, in a modern building
        called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sailor‚Äôs House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Marinos</ENAMEX>), you can find out what
        became of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quaint ‚ÄúTagus squadron‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> enjoyed being rowed down the river in gala launches. These
        flagships are preserved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sailor‚Äôs House</ENAMEX>, along with related
        nautical mementoes.
        Aside from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aranjuez</ENAMEX> is noted for
        its royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and gardens. The formal gardens are a wonder of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">clip¬≠p¬≠ed hedges</ENAMEX>, sculptures, and fountains.
        Chinch√≥n
        A nice side trip (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km or 12 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aranjuez</ENAMEX>,
        through gently undulating hill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinch√≥n</ENAMEX>. Here is
        charming proof that you do not have to travel <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of miles</NUMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> to immerse yourself in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> of pack-donkeys on cobbled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lanes</ENAMEX>. The town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> could be a stage set: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story white
        stucco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> surround an irregular, but vaguely
        oval <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinch√≥n</ENAMEX> is celebrated as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of various aniseed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liqueurs</ENAMEX>. It also grows a much-vaunted species of garlic, sold locally
        in strung bouquets.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> style, it depicts the physical and spiritual superlatives
        of the empire‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Felipe II</ENAMEX> ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Escorial</ENAMEX> built in celebration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1557</TIMEX> at the battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quentin</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> himself died here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1598</TIMEX>, to be buried in
        a family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> beneath the high altar of the basilica. Sheer statistics
        don‚Äôt do full justice to the extravagant scale of the royal palace
        complex, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 21 years</TIMEX>. The longest wall is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 295</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meters</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">970 feet</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner tower</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of the palace
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> rises <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">92 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">302 feet</NUMEX>). By <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> count, the building
        contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> altars, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> stairways, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,200</NUMEX> doors, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,600</NUMEX>
        windows. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> used to call it the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> wonder of the world.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan de Herrera</ENAMEX>, considered the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
        of the age, inherited the project after another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> had only
        begun the work. He also built the royal palace of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aranjuez</ENAMEX> and
        reconstructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√</ENAMEX>°zar of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>.
        The mood achieved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bas√≠lica</ENAMEX>, shaped like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>, is one of devout magnificence. The immense main retable is
        composed of red marble, green jasper, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gilded bronze</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX> finely
        carved seats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> include a slightly roomier one for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe</ENAMEX> II.
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of artworks collected here, none attracts more admiration
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the life-size</TIMEX> marble crucifix by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benvenuto Cellini</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>. It
        is said that the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> originally planned the statue
        to adorn his own grave.
        Exactly below the high altar, at the bottom of a flight of
        marble stairs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pante√≥n Real</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Pantheon</ENAMEX>) is a subterranean
        churchyard of history. In the central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, identical marble sarcophagi
        are stacked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> high. Gilded angels hold lamps illuminating the terse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> inscriptions. Of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hapsburg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> who ruled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> are missing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe V</ENAMEX> is buried at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Granja de San</ENAMEX>
        Ildefonso, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand VI</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>). Adjoining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> are assigned to
        lesser royal personages, with a gloomy area devoted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princes</ENAMEX> who
        died in childhood.
        Above ground again, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> rare books and manuscripts of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immeasurable</ENAMEX> beauty and value are preserved in the biblioteca (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>)
        created by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II. Architect Herrera</ENAMEX> even took pains to design the
        bookcases, done in rare woods. The vaulted ceiling is a sight in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">itself‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> painting symbolizing the arts and sciences, specifically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grammar</ENAMEX>, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, music, geometry, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astronomy</ENAMEX>. At opposite ends, philosophy and theology are extolled.
        After seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, visitors
        are shown through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palacio de los Borbones</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of the Bourbons</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is more lavish than the next. The tapestries based on original
        designs by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX> are outstanding. On the opposite side of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX> of the masks (named after the design of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fountains), the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salones Reales</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX>) are modest in comforts, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> in artworks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> died here among cherished paintings‚Äîa
        fantastic triptych by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hieronymus Bosch</ENAMEX> and works on religious themes by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to the fine paintings found elsewhere in the
        escorial, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> have been created to display the great works
        commissioned or collected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monarchs</ENAMEX>. In the stately
        surroundings hang pictures by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribera, Tintoretto</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vel√°zquez.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> will find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> of his canvases, including
        a unique portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX> at prayer in a sweep¬≠ing celestial
        scene, as well as the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mar¬≠tirio de San Mauricio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Martyr¬</ENAMEX>≠dom

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> decreed that a memorial for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> be
        built on a site chosen personally by him. The monument is at least
        equally dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fascist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirty-five</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, the caudillo (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strongman</ENAMEX>)
        was buried beneath a simple stone slab in the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley of the Fallen</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Official¬≠ly</ENAMEX>, it is termed the ‚Äúlargest basilica
        ever built in the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mankind</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù The colossal mon¬≠¬≠ument was
        hewn out of the side of the mountain like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway tunnel</ENAMEX>. The stone

        top of a rocky outcrop. The cross is said to weigh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">181,740 tons</NUMEX>. The
        arcaded fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, in a style reminiscent of Italian fascist
        architecture, is big enough to fill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">esplanade</ENAMEX>.

        surrounding plains. The city‚Äôs setting is picturesque Castilian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">campo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwide</ENAMEX>-open space interrupted only by a clump of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, a lonely

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Guadarrama</ENAMEX> fills half the horizon.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of great historical monuments, all
        testament to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> one-time glories: a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">storybook Alc√°zar</ENAMEX>, and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cathedrals</ENAMEX>.
        The wondrous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Aqueduct</ENAMEX>, a work of art and a triumph
        of engineering, marches right through the center of town. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX>
        is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> blocks arranged in graceful arches,
        sometimes two-tiered, but without mortar or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX> of any kind. It is
        nearly <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a kilometer</NUMEX> (half-mile) long, and it rises to a height of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meters</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 feet</NUMEX>). This is the last lap of a conduit bringing water
        from a mountain stream to the walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX> was in constant
        use for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, with only a couple of details changed. A
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> has been installed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> atop the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX>,
        and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX> in a niche over the
        tallest arch was replaced by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> image. Traffic was only
        recently diverted from passing through the aqueduct‚Äôs arches, as
        pollution was threatening permanent damage to the irreplaceable
        structure.
        The fairytale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°zar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs incomparable royal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castle</ENAMEX>, was erected in a strategic spot, on a ridge overlooking the
        confluence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rivers, with an unimpeded view of the plateau in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> are thought to have been among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
        build a watchtower here. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, reportedly the model for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX>, is a far cry from the simple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone fortress</ENAMEX> that took shape
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>. As the fortress grew bigger and more luxurious, it
        played a more significant historical role. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>,
        parliaments were convened here. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1474</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> stayed in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√</ENAMEX>°zar at the time of her coronation as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX>, and in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1570</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX> married his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>, at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel</ENAMEX>. Less ceremoniously, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan II</ENAMEX> became a dungeon
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>. The most fanciful and photogenic
        parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">castle‚Äôs superstructure‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇits feast</ENAMEX> of turrets and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">towers‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇare the work of restoration after a disastrous fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1862</TIMEX>.
        From the top of a hefty climb up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> are breathtaking views of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX> and the valley beyond.
        From whatever part of town you view it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catedral</ENAMEX> is a
        beautiful sight. Its pinnacles, buttresses, and cupolas seem to belong
        to a whole complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, not a single elegant monument. Begun in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1525</TIMEX> (but not consecrated until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1768</TIMEX>), this is the last of the great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish Gothic</ENAMEX> cathedrals and possibly the last Gothic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Its grace and style have won it the nickname of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúgrand dame</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedrals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Incidentally</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> was even taller until a
        lightning bolt lopped off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1614</TIMEX>. The reconstruction
        plan warily lowered the profile by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 10 percent</NUMEX>.
        Inside, the cathedral‚Äôs majestic columns and arches are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lit</ENAMEX> by fine stained-glass windows. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two 18th-century</TIMEX> organs are
        spectacularly flamboyant. Less obvious are the altarpieces in the
        chapels, the most important element of which (just to the right of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">entrance</ENAMEX>) is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polychrome</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piet√</ENAMEX>† by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencian Juan de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juni</ENAMEX>.
        Delicate arches line the cloister, which belonged to the
        former cathedral that was destroyed; it was moved here, stone by stone,
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> and put back together. The adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and
        chapter house contain a number of interesting pieces of religious art
        and relics, including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> tapestries, the Baroque carriage
        propelled through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX> every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX>, and the
        reminder of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> tragedy: the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of the infant prince
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Enrique</ENAMEX> II. He slipped from the arms of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> as she
        admired the view from an open window of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°zar.</ENAMEX> The nanny scarcely
        hesitated before she leaped after him to her death in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX>
        below.
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>, combines
        history with real-life bustle. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Buildings</ENAMEX> as pleasing as the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> take time out for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> in the fresh air.
        During festivals, the square springs to life with excitement and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>.
        Only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> away to the east, a much older church
        than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cathedral graces Segovia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most charming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Iglesia de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Mart√</ENAMEX>≠n is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> beauty with glorious portals
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza de San Mart√≠n</ENAMEX>, which slopes down to calle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Juan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bravo</ENAMEX>, is surrounded by noble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>.
        Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with those
        fierce, barred windows was, in fact, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> when it was built in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th century</TIMEX>. Now it houses a library and archives. Here and throughout
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the fa√ßades of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are subject to elaborate
        three-dimensional decoration, mainly with geometric forms. The most
        unique example, the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casa de los Picos</ENAMEX>, bristles with pointed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protuberances</ENAMEX>.
        Total tranquility permeates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monasterio de El Parral</ENAMEX>,
        founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-15th century</TIMEX> just beyond the city walls (but within
        easy reach of the center of town). The architectural details, including
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> cloister, are being restored in fits and starts. Especially
        dramatic is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> high retable in the monastery‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX>.
        Even more interesting, also just outside the wall and
        almost in the shadow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°zar</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iglesia de la Vera Cruz</ENAMEX>, an
        unusual <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-sided structure dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 13th century</TIMEX>. The
        knights of the Holy Sepulchre held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in its unique double-decker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">chapel</ENAMEX> surrounded by a circular nave. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Maltese</ENAMEX> order, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, renovated it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX>.
        So much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX> is superlative that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th-century</TIMEX>
        city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> itself is almost relegated to second-class status. A walk
        around the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 1‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 1‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) of wall is irregular but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evocative</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Granja de San Ildefonso</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">southeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km or 50 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>), is a huge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX> set in classic formal gardens. Here, too, the tapestries, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16th</NUMEX>-
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> mas terpieces, are well worth seeing; they were
        collected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">royal family</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riofr√≠o</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">85 km</NUMEX> or
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">53 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>), has an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> that is quite
        modest compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX>. Part of it is now devoted
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo de Caza</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hunting Museum</ENAMEX>), with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stuffed animals</ENAMEX> and ancient
        weapons. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is reached by taking the scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer sanctuary</ENAMEX>.
        √Åvila
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Pop.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38,200</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">112 km/70 miles</NUMEX> northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>)
        The fairy-tale stone walls (murallas) protecting √Åvila,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the great images of medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, are rather too perfect: from
        afar, they make the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Castilian Disneyland</ENAMEX>. But they
        were built in all seriousness in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade of the 11th century</TIMEX>.
        The ramparts are arguably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest extant fortifications, and
        they are the undisputed highlight of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">√Åvila</NUMEX>. They measure <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 1‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) long, averaging <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 feet</NUMEX>) in height, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 2,500</NUMEX> niches suitable for sentries or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marksmen</ENAMEX>.
        If you‚Äôre visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, you‚Äôll appreciate the
        cooler mountain air of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√Åvila‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇSpain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> highest provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, at
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 1,125 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,700 feet</NUMEX>) above sea level. Before the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúmodern‚Äù √Åvila</ENAMEX> was built behind its crenellated wall, Celtiberians
        settled in the area and are credited with having sculpted the crude
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bulls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        Besides its walls, √Åvila is famous for its long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Teresa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">de √Åvila‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> mystic and church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Theresa</ENAMEX>. Born in √Åvila in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1515</TIMEX>, she spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</TIMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convento de la Incarnaci√≥n</ENAMEX>, outside the city walls, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX> and
        later as prioress. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Convento de Santa Teresa</ENAMEX> was built on the site
        of the saint‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX>. Among the other landmarks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convento de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San Jos√</ENAMEX>© was founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Theresa</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1562</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carmelite</ENAMEX>
        convents she eventually established. Theresa was canonized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1622</TIMEX> and
        proclaimed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">√Åvila</TIMEX>, you can see relics
        and manuscripts and even the habit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Theresa</ENAMEX> wore in a remarkable
        life of prayer, penance, and poverty.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catedral</ENAMEX>, built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the 12th and 16th centuries</TIMEX>,
        includes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> elements. It even has a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> (cimorro) that is part of the city walls. Fine
        stained-glass windows accentuate the grace of the interior. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stalls</ENAMEX>, carved to illustrate the lives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, are attributed to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornelius de Holanda</ENAMEX>. The high
        retable was begun by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Berruguete</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, but he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1504</TIMEX>, before it could be finished. In the
        ambulatory behind the altar is a brilliantly sculpted alabaster
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monument</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alonso de Madrigal</ENAMEX>, whose dark complexion
        won him the nickname el tostado (the toasted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bas√≠lica de San Vicente</ENAMEX> just outside the city walls is
        considerably smaller than the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, but hardly less inspiring. The
        main (west) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> features lifelike statues of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apostles‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbarefoot</ENAMEX>, long-haired, bearded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, seemingly caught off
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guard</ENAMEX> by a candid sculptor. Inside, an extraordinary tomb commemorates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Vincente of Zaragoza</ENAMEX> and his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>, martyred in the 4th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. Knights of old placed their hands on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 12th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sepulchre</ENAMEX> when they took their oaths.
        Melancholy history surrounds the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monasterio de San Tom√</ENAMEX>°s
        (to the southeast, down the hill), the construction of which was
        sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX>. Their only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Juan</ENAMEX>,
        died here at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 19</TIMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> lies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs
        worth climbing the old stone stairs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">choir loft</ENAMEX> to see the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood-carvings</ENAMEX>, particularly on the seats reserved for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monarchs</ENAMEX> themselves. This was also the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the monarchs‚Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confessor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX>, the noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom√°s de Torquemada</ENAMEX>. As the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grand inquisitor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, he was the enthusiastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witch</ENAMEX>-hunt.
