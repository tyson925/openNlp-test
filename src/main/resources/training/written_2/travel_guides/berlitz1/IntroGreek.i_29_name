        The classical gods made their home here, fighting their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">battles</ENAMEX>, having their love affairs, and giving birth to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> coveted them over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7,000 years ago</TIMEX>, and they were
        stepping-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> on the long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastâ€“West</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX> throughout
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenistic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times. Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of the last two millennia</TIMEX>,
        they were fought over by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">superpowers</ENAMEX> and became pawns in the
        religious conflicts between Christianity and Islam. Although they now
        form part of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, a deep imprint of historyâ€™s
        footsteps can be seen clearly on every dusty hill, in every olive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">grove</ENAMEX>, and along every coastline. Today, with their hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer days</TIMEX>,
        warm waters, abundant beaches, and distinct lifestyle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> are among the major tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX> in the
        world.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> is a small sea, a finger of water <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">640 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">397</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) long, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">320 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">198 miles</NUMEX>) wide, pointing up out of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">eastern Mediterranean</ENAMEX> between the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>.
        Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,400</NUMEX> islands, although scattered, form a series of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, each with its own particular character. This guide will
        introduce you to many, but not all, of the popular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX>.
        The most accessible islands from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclades</ENAMEX> to
        the southeast, thrown like a handful of pebbles into the sea. In
        ancient times, they sat in a circle (cyclos) around the sacred island
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delos</ENAMEX>, and their name has carried through into modern times. The
        islandsâ€™ barren landscapes and stark white, cubical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with their
        blue-shuttered windows bedecked with geraniums represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        islands to many. The most popular and best known are the lively island
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykonos</ENAMEX> and the awe-inspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caldera</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX>.
        Collected together in the southeastern reaches of the Aegean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodecanese</ENAMEX> islands. They rest against the southwest corner
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> coastline. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is Rhodes
        (covered in its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlitz Pocket Guide</ENAMEX>), but others include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kos</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patmos</ENAMEX>. In the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of its larger islands mirror the
        western <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> coastline. Lesvos, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chios</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samos</ENAMEX> still have many
        vestiges of the traditional rural lifestyle that made them rich and
        coveted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">previous centuries</TIMEX>.
        In the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> more disparate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">islandsâ€‚â€”â€‚Thasos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Limnos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Samothrakiâ€‚â€”â€‚while</ENAMEX> southwest of these,
        closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sporades</ENAMEX> islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skiathos, Skopelos</ENAMEX>,
        Alonissos, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skyrosâ€‚â€”â€‚until</ENAMEX> recently the exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> jet set.
        The volatile and fascinating history of the whole area means
        that no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands are identical, although similarities do exist.
        Despite countless different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlords</ENAMEX>, the basic elements of the way of
        life of ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have changed little for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5,000 years</TIMEX>. The
        seas produced abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>, and the warm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summers</ENAMEX> brought forth <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> that sustained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and provided
        grazing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. onward.
        Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX>, donkeys and mules have provided a
        means of transport; around the same time, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> olives and vines
        were planted in the ground. Life was governed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> of planting,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tending</ENAMEX>, and harvesting. Look around the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> islands <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and there
        is little cause to think that much has changed.
        Tradition plays a great part in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> lifestyle. The sexes
        still lead separate lives, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, chatting across
        balconies festooned with washing or sitting on shady <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street corners</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> work in the fields or at their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, with older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kafeneion</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee shopâ€‚â€”â</ENAMEX>€‚where the world is put to rights over a
        strong cafÃ© ellenikos.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is the core of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX>, especially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>, are seen as a blessing and are treated with indulgence, fussed
        over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grandparents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> push the
        carriages of the new arrivals during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> volta, or stroll,
        glowing in the warmth of the congratulations of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fathers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX> employ <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> and nephews in family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, before any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>.
        The siesta is an important part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. Everyone from
        the youngest to the oldest rests during the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> and
        makes the most of the cool evenings, often not going to bed until well
        after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>.
        Historically, the fabric of life has been sustained by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religion</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> religion, was identified
        with all that was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> long before the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> was created in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1832</TIMEX>. Through natural disaster, war, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has been
        there as a place of refuge and solace, both physically and spiritually.
        To this day, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> has a strong influence within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> have traditionally formed the majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congregation</ENAMEX>,
        praying for the protection of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> while
        they were away at sea in merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleets</ENAMEX>, diving for sponges, or
        working in lands far away. The smallest whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches house</ENAMEX> a
        simple cross, icon, and lit candles, although you will find the largest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> are somewhat more lavish and ornate.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> once had the largest merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> in the world,
        and the sea still plays a major role in the life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>. On
        smaller, more remote islands, ferries form the only transportation link
        with the outside world. They carry essential goods, just as they have
        done throughout history. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has a flotilla of small craft
        setting sail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> to bring fresh catch to the islandâ€™s tables.
        However, tourism has begun to alter this long-standing
        scenario. It is now the biggest money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">earner</ENAMEX> in the islands. In high
        season, you will share your <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">odyssey</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from almost
        every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and increasingly from around the world. This
        has saved many islands from the brink of poverty and depopulation,
        although it is undoubtedly affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of many of the more
        popular islands. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX> society has seen more change in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last twenty</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous thousand</TIMEX>.
        Today, motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scooters</ENAMEX> often drown the sound of playing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and mobile phones are heard far more frequently than the
        haunting cadences of the bazouki. More often than not, the harried man
        walking briskly along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> while taking his <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">callâ€‚â€”â€‚often</ENAMEX> waving
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animated fashionâ€‚â€”â€‚has</ENAMEX> a business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>,
        car-rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and studio <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> to manage.
        He needs to keep his finger on the pulse to succeed during the short
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tourist</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>.
        As incomes rise, the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> buys a truck to replace
        his fatherâ€™s trusty donkey, or he gives up farming altogether to open a
        bar or car-rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. The fisherman uses his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>
        to nearby beaches rather than to catch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.
        But the picture is not quite as bleak as it is painted.
        Tourism too is a seasonal industry, fitting neatly into the traditional
        cyclical pattern of island life. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> arrive,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> give birth and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> out to the open
        pasture; a little later, the grain <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> is harvested. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>
        approaches, another harvest begins. Olives, walnuts, almonds, and late
        developing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> must all be brought in and preserved before the start
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>.
        So in a sense, island life continues just as it always
        has!
