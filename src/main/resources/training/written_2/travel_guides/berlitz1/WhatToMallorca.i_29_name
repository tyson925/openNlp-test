        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
        Though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> may not be the bargain-basement destination it
        was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>, it is still less expensive than most other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a number of excellent deals in the
        Balearics, particularly on handcrafts, leather goods, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramics</ENAMEX>. There are flea markets and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> markets in many small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>
        (see box, page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX>). On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>, the crowds flock to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baratillo</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market (even the signs on city <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> call it by
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> name). There you‚Äôre sure to find everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fossils</ENAMEX>, and bargains include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs artificial pearls and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lace‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇoffered</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúliquidation‚Äù prices by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>.
        Best Buys
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> are justly famous for their leather
        industries. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> have been making quality
        shoes, some of the finest leather and suede clothing, and exquisite
        handbags come from the islands. The focus of the leather industry in
        Mallorca are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inca</ENAMEX>; you can visit them and shop at the
        factory <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> (though prices will be lower than on mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> or
        your home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, they may not be any cheaper than what you‚Äôll find in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>). Menorca, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ciutadella</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaior</ENAMEX> are known for their leather
        goods. Of special interest among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Menorcan</ENAMEX> footwear are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abarcas</ENAMEX>, flat,
        slipper-like sandals worn by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. In response to the
        tourism industry, they have grown progressively less simple‚Äîall kinds
        of colors and skins are now available‚Äîbut you can still get the
        original, endearingly simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abarca</ENAMEX>, in brown, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>, black, and yellow,
        for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than US$20</NUMEX>.
        Mallorcan cultured (artificial) pearls, manufactured in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manacor</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>), are exported in great numbers. They‚Äôre a good
        buy on the island, and prices do not vary much from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> to shop. There
        may be a small savings at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory showrooms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manacor</ENAMEX>, where
        you‚Äôll have the biggest choice.
        Mallorca‚Äôs embroidered linens for the table and bed are
        quite attractive. The fair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Llucmajor</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second Sunday</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>,
        is a great place to find excellent examples. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> known for
        embroidery are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manacor, Pollen√ßa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art√†.</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> Can
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana</ENAMEX> sell fine handmade embroidery. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Woven cotton</ENAMEX> and linen
        are also a good buy. Look for the typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mallorcan</ENAMEX> teles de llengues
        (painted fabrics, in green, blue, and pink, used for decoration in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peasant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>). Handmade baskets are also a specialty. Renowned
        Mallorcan glassware has been manufactured on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> since the 14th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gordiola</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, with a fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, is on the
        road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manacor</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Authentically Mallorcan</ENAMEX> are the pottery
        figures called siurells, painted in red and green on white on baked,
        whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX>. Similar relics have been around since Phoenician
        times. They have a spout-like whistle, and rather phallic versions are
        grounded in fertility lore.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Wines</ENAMEX> and many other alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> are still cheap by the
        standards of the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. This applies especially to foreign
        brands made under license in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> cigars are significantly less
        than you would pay elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, though legally they
        cannot be taken back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Tips</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> overshadows all other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> in the scale
        and sophistication of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. Palma‚Äôs excellent selection of chic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shoe</ENAMEX>, bag, and clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> is concentrated along <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avinguda del Rei</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume III</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Passeig d‚Äôes Born</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conquistador</ENAMEX>. Look out for jewelry
        along carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plateria</ENAMEX>, and try carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Jaume II</ENAMEX> for clothing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>.
        Pla√ßa Major holds a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Friday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>,
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mah√≥n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> have smaller but attractive pedestrian-only
        shopping areas.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Hours</ENAMEX>
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 9:00am to 1 or 1:30pm</TIMEX>, closing
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> for lunch and siesta, and again from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:30 or 5 to 8pm</TIMEX>. Big
        department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarkets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> buck tradition and remain
        open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort areas</ENAMEX> may stay open until
        10pm. Almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are closed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>.
        Entertainment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folklore and Festivals</ENAMEX>
        With the revival of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> dialects has come a renewed
        interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Balearic</ENAMEX> culture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> learn many traditional dances,
        and shows are put on by folk dance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troupes</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> as well as during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fiestas</ENAMEX>. The oldest dances are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> times, and are
        usually performed in mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. Dances are held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algaida</ENAMEX> on
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16 August</TIMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montuiri</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 23</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. The dance of els cavallets is performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pollen√</ENAMEX>ßa on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> August
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√≠a de la Patrona</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Felanitx</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 July</TIMEX> and again on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D√≠a de Sant August√</ENAMEX>≠ on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 August</TIMEX>. Another dance, the parado, resembles
        a courtly minuet: it is performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valldemossa</ENAMEX> in the square beside
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. The distinctive dances of Menorca include the ball d‚Äôes
        cossil, thought to be derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scottish</ENAMEX> dancing. The dance,
        something like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> maypole dance, is performed during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fiesta</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Migjorn Gran</ENAMEX>.
        Late <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Island Nights</ENAMEX>
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> and the major tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> are a
        primary diversion for the beach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>. They‚Äôre not as frenetic, though,
        as on sister island <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, where the mayhem is legendary. You may be
        offered tickets to buy while lying on the beach, or even free ones if
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> are trying to boost a place, or if the tiquetero thinks that
        your good looks will be an asset. There are bars of all kinds
        everywhere, some local, but more often than not with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> d√©cors, accents, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beers</ENAMEX>.
        Large package <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entertainers</ENAMEX> operating in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> languages to loosen up the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> with competitions,
        sing-alongs, and a more sedate sort of dancing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotels</ENAMEX> sometimes
        organize flamenco <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>; even though these songs and dances come from
        Andalusia, they have become a feature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The
        shows are usually pretty touristy, concentrating on the more cheerful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cante chico</ENAMEX> (light song) rather than the deep, emotional cante jondo
        (song of the soul). Still, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, guitarists, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flashy</ENAMEX>, colorful costumes are enjoyable to all but the purist.
        For concerts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Auditorium on Palma‚</ENAMEX>Äôs waterfront has a
        regular schedule of events from opera to heavy metal. Films are usually
        screened dubbed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>, with rare exceptions in the biggest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> has a charming outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> festival, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinema</ENAMEX> a la
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fresca</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc des Freginal</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>.
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> is best known for its gay nightlife,
        Mallorca, and to a lesser extent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menorca</ENAMEX>, also have a spate of
        nightlife options aimed at alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lifestyles</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>, the best
        option is to contact the association <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Amics</ENAMEX> (carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Impremta</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">971/72 30 58</NUMEX>) for a list of caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> that are gay-friendly.
        Sports
        Although new leisure pursuits are drawing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the
        Balearics, the primary aim of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> still revolves
        around sun and, most of all, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Besides the beach, water sports,
        especially boating and sailing, are the islands‚Äô primary draw.
        Swimming. Gently sloping expanses of sand, rocks to dive
        off into the deep waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, sheltered bay, or open
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX>: the choice is enormous, so try to find out what the beach is like
        before you choose your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. For learning to windsurf (boardsail),
        choose somewhere with plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shallow water</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ses Salines</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>). Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguards</ENAMEX> are rare, larger beaches do have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first-aid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>. Just a few more words of warning: Beware of spiky
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> urchins when swimming off rocks. Take along plenty of protective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sunscreen‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇFactor 20</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boating</ENAMEX> and sailing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> are a sailing paradise,
        with safe <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">harbors</ENAMEX> and marinas a short cruise from quiet coves.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> keep their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX>. You can hire various
        sorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, at many beaches and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>
        (but note that you will be required to produce a valid proof of
        qualification for a self-drive motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>). The stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pedalo</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> they‚Äôve hired at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. At any speed, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> is a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird</ENAMEX>-watching. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">islands‚Äô resident birds</ENAMEX> would be
        enticing enough, but it‚Äôs the visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that generate most
        excitement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Migrants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> stop to rest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>, and
        some stay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Birds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">prey</ENAMEX> that are rare elsewhere in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> are often spotted here, and stretches of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and wetlands,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator</ENAMEX> sports
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> are part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, but bullfights are not the
        big deal they are on the mainland. They‚Äôre staged on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer Sunday</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">afternoons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palma‚</ENAMEX>Äôs large bullring (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pla√ßa de Toros</ENAMEX>). There are
        occasional bullfights at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plazas de Toros</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alc√∫dia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Felanitx</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inca</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muro; Menorca</ENAMEX> has no bullfights. If you‚Äôve never seen a
        corrida, be prepared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> an ancient ritual that for aficionados
        is more art than sport. Choose your seat carefully: sol means you‚Äôll be
        in the full heat and dazzle of the sun, at least at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. The more
        expensive sombra seats will land you in the shade, so sol y sombra
        means that you‚Äôll get some of each, though the sun won‚Äôt be in your
        eyes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> are held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX>, all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> round, at

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX>. The informal atmosphere and casual-looking handicap starts
        can be deceptive. The competition is fierce, involving foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Betting</ENAMEX> is organized through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">centralized ‚Äútote‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        system.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Children‚Äôs Mallorca</ENAMEX> and Menorca
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics‚</ENAMEX>Äô fine sandy beaches and sunny weather make
        them an ideal family destination. If the beach or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX> begins to pall,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> can make a bigger splash on a giant waterslide. Aquacity at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S‚ÄôArenal</ENAMEX> claims to be the biggest aquatic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in the world. The staff
        is safety-conscious, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> can relax at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park‚Äôs pools</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caf√©s.</ENAMEX> The larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> are quite expensive, so plan a long stay to get
        your money‚Äôs worth. Other water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> are found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Magalluf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√∫dia</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Jaume</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>. More sedate is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marineland</ENAMEX>, west of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> at

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat excursion</ENAMEX> is an excellent diversion for both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boats</ENAMEX> link all the resorts fringing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S‚</ENAMEX>ÄôArenal to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portals Vells‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇif you wish, you can use them
        like a bus service. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port de Pollen√</ENAMEX>ßa or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAlc√∫dia, try a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cruise</ENAMEX> around the dramatic cliffs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Formentor</ENAMEX>. Sailings from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de S√≥ller</ENAMEX> go to the rugged northwest coast, including the canyon at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torrent de Pareis/Sa Calobra</ENAMEX>. In the south, trips from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Col√≤nia de Sant</ENAMEX>
        Jordi/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Campos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> at the strange little isle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabrera</ENAMEX>. A cruise
        around the historic harbor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> is also fun.
        You‚Äôll see rhinos, ostriches, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antelopes</ENAMEX> living happily
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserva Africana</ENAMEX>, a small safari <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cala Millor</ENAMEX> on
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Mallorca‚Äôs</NUMEX> east coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> drive through as slowly as they like or
        ride on an open <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX>.
        Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will appreciate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Granja</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Esporles</ENAMEX> (see
        page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>). On this beautiful old country estate you can see craftspeople
        working and lively folk dance displays.
        The charming antique <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> going between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> and S√≥ller
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>) is bound to be popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of all ages.
        Mallorca‚Äôs other line, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inca</ENAMEX>, is not as picturesque, but
        it‚Äôs a fun way of reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Inca‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> market.
