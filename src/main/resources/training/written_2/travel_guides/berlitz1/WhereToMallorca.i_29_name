        Whether you‚Äôre in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>, a coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, or an inland
        village, you can reach any point on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>, and Menorca
        is even smaller and more concentrated. On both islands, tour companies
        offer excursions by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> or in combinations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trips, to see the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mountain</ENAMEX> and coastal scenery, famed beaches, spectacular caves, and
        various purpose-built attractions. At these sights, though, you‚Äôll
        invariably be part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, especially in high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> (which grows
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>). Accommodations are also at a premium from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> through
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. Charter flights and package deals (hotel and airfare) become
        considerably more economical if you‚Äôre willing to visit in the shoulder
        or off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>.
        Hiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">104</NUMEX>) is the ideal way to see Mallorca
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menorca</ENAMEX>, allowing you to go where you like‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsome of the
        least-known places are the most delightful. You can get around by
        public bus, with a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> thrown in, but those options won‚Äôt
        allow you to see as much in a short time.
        The great majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> through
        its capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma de Mallorca</ENAMEX> (and in fact, most stay within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) or so of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, ensconced in seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and villas). Any
        thought you might have had that you would be vacationing in a sleepy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> island backwater will quickly be dashed upon arrival at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sprawling Son Sant Joan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma de Mallorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
        As islands go, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> is quite large: it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 550</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">325 miles</NUMEX>) of coastline and is, at its widest, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>)
        across. Visiting all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> with any degree of
        seriousness would require <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX>, while most of much-smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> can be seen in a week‚Äôs time. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a short holiday</TIMEX>, it‚Äôs best to
        choose a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">regions</ENAMEX> and take them in at a relaxed pace. See the
        list of beach highlights on pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82 and 85</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PALMA DE MALLORCA</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> is a large, cosmopolitan, working <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>. Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> feels undeniably tropical and sensual. This has
        something to do with the palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, relentless sunshine, yachts
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bobbing</ENAMEX> in the bay, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> laying out their nets on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">waterfront</ENAMEX>, to be sure, but it‚Äôs also a product of the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> talk,
        walk, dress, and sip <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> at outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>©s. Their leisurely
        manner tells you this is no mainland capital.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palma</ENAMEX> dominates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">island‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> glance at the map shows how
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">island‚Äôs road system</ENAMEX> radiates from the city‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut it is a world far
        removed from the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of the northwest, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of
        the interior, and the tourist-ruled coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villas</ENAMEX>. The area of
        greatest interest to visitors is the small old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> that surrounds
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, which sits on a small hill overlooking the bay. Historic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> can be seen in a day or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, though the plazas, caf√©s,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> may cause you to linger.
        From the harbor the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gothic</ENAMEX> cathedral rises on a small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX> and dominates the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with the ancient Almudaina
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> immediately below it. To the east is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Platja de Palma</ENAMEX>, a long
        line of excellent sandy beaches that have been defaced by a sad stretch
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ca‚Äôn Pastilla</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S‚ÄôArenal</ENAMEX>; to the west is the elegant
        seaside promenade, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passeig Mar√≠tim</ENAMEX>, of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>, where luxury
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> look out over a forest of masts in the yacht harbor. Crowning
        the wooded slopes above it are the stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellver Castle</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> established a strategic post near where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>
        now stands so gracefully, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> were primarily responsible for
        transforming the site into a real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> remain,
        having been razed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old quarter</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre</ENAMEX>
        Historic on direction signs) still abounds with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of historic
        interest, preserved when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> fell into decline in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th</TIMEX> and 17th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>. The old city‚Äôs narrow, atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are full of
        pleasant surprises, best seen on foot.
        The focus of any visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> is, justifiably, its
        massive <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gothic Cathedral‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇone of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Seu</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, it was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1230</TIMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> recaptured
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Jaume</ENAMEX> made an emphatic political point
        by ordering it built on the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Mosque</ENAMEX>. Building was slow
        and sporadic, affected by wars and finance, and the great work took
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly four centuries</TIMEX> to complete. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Densely</ENAMEX> packed buttresses facing
        seaward create an extraordinary effect of power and beauty, especially
        when they blaze like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> in the setting sun and cast their reflection
        in the pool below. Before entering, have a look at the remarkable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portal del Mirador</ENAMEX> entrance, overlooking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palma‚Äôs bay</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 14th-century</TIMEX>
        door is a feast of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carved stone figurines</ENAMEX>, including a depiction of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Supper</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guillem Sagrera</ENAMEX>. The north door of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, near
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, is reserved for those attending religious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early evening</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> are
        encouraged to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> in conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> next door, a treasure-trove of silver monstrances and
        candelabra, saintly relics, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> paintings, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX> altars. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colossal</ENAMEX> and ornate early <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> doorway in carved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> leads on
        to the oval <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Chapter House</ENAMEX>. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, one enters the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>.
        The wrought-iron <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown of Thorns</ENAMEX> canopy over the high altar
        (called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baldachino</ENAMEX>) was added by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan</ENAMEX> modernista <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoni Gaud√</ENAMEX>≠ at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 20th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaud√≠</ENAMEX>, who worked
        some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>, also moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> stalls from the
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nave</ENAMEX>.
        On the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">l‚ÄôAlmudaina</ENAMEX>, once the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>. Part of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, and a short tour takes in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX>-vaulted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">throne room</ENAMEX>, divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stories in the
        16th <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">century‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou‚Äôll</ENAMEX> see that the window was cut off in the process.
        In the heavily restored royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, which are used by the present
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">king</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX>, traces of early paintwork survive on ceilings and
        frescoed walls. There are also several impressive 15th- and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> tapestries.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leafy Passeig des Born</ENAMEX>, the elongated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> that runs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inland</ENAMEX>, is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> love to take their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early evening</TIMEX> promenade.
        Once the site of jousting tournaments, it‚Äôs now lined with park benches
        and caf√©s. At no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> is an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italianate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>, Casa
        Solleric, which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> houses a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> art
        exhibitions.
        In the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> behind the cathedral are tall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>,
        several of which are baronial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th</TIMEX> and 16th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>, with dark walls and great wooden doors. Their forbidding
        exteriors hide some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palma‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most inviting courtyards, which can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glimpsed</ENAMEX> through the heavy metal grilles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Can Bordils</ENAMEX> on carrer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Almudaina</ENAMEX> retains its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> architecture; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Can Oms</ENAMEX>, at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, is an
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">noble house</ENAMEX> with one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palma‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patios</ENAMEX>. Crossing
        over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almudaina</ENAMEX> is the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arc de L‚ÄôAlmudaina</ENAMEX>.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courtyards</ENAMEX> were remodeled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th and 18th centuries</TIMEX>,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Olesa</ENAMEX> (carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morey</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), with its cool, wide-arched
        patios, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> and stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX>. Other spectacular mansions
        are nearby on carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Can Savell√†; look for the the Baroque Can</ENAMEX> Vivot
        (sometimes called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Can Sureda</ENAMEX>) at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Can Catlar del Llorer</ENAMEX>,
        with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">patio</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, at number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Portella</ENAMEX>, a palatial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Renaissance</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>
        has been restored as the somewhat sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu de Mallorca</ENAMEX>.
        Descriptions are only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Catalan</ENAMEX>, but the relics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> period
        and fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th- to 15th-century</TIMEX> paintings and carvings, originally from
        Palma‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, antique tiles and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and a display of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">modernista</ENAMEX> furniture on the top floor make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> worth a visit.
        The top floor also houses exhibitions by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mallorcan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
        Old photographs show some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> gateways that were destroyed when
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> walls were razed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banys √Ärabs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab Baths</ENAMEX>), behind
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Can Serra</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, are miraculously still standing
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years</TIMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bas√≠lica de Sant Francesc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bas√≠lica of St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>), on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Sant Francesc</ENAMEX>, is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palma‚</ENAMEX>Äôs treasures. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">statue of Jun√≠pero Serra</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the first
        Franciscan missions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, is erected in front of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plateresque</ENAMEX> carved portal. Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> lies the sarcophagus of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ram√≥n Llull</ENAMEX>. He and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
        Mallorca‚Äôs greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heroes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthey</ENAMEX> have both been beatified,
        and sainthood seems sure to follow. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is rather dark and
        heavy, a real contrast with the enchanting cloisters, whose slender
        double columns and stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracery</ENAMEX> are light and delicate.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Cort</ENAMEX> is the site of the fine wooden-eaved
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Ajuntament</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>) and from there it‚Äôs a
        short way by smart shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to the yellow fa√ßades and green
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shutters of the Pla√</ENAMEX>ßa Major, the former marketplace. On the west side
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√</ENAMEX>ßa Major is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pla√ßa de Marqu√©s Palmer</ENAMEX>; sandwiched among chic
        leather and footwear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> excellent examples of modernista
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalan Art Nouveau</ENAMEX>) architecture: Can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forteza Rei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L‚Äô√Äguila</ENAMEX>, whose
        iron grill work and broken-tile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">flourishes</ENAMEX> are similar to better-known
        modernista <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX>
        Down the steps that lead to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√</ENAMEX>ßa Major is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Pla√ßa</ENAMEX> Weyler
        (off of carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uni√≥</ENAMEX>), where there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more fine examples of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modernisme</ENAMEX>. One is the imposing and ornate former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Hotel</ENAMEX>. The first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mallorca</ENAMEX>, it was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Llu√≠s Dom√</ENAMEX>©nech i

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la M√</ENAMEX>∫sica concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>. Across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gran Hotel</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bakery</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forn des Teatre</ENAMEX>, whose modernista decoration graces many a postcard
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>. Down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa Mercat</ENAMEX>, is Can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casayas</ENAMEX>, two
        more gently undulating modernista <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
        Back near the waterfront, the turreted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa Llotja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Lonja</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>) was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-15th century</TIMEX> by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guillem Sagrera</ENAMEX> (the seafront promenade is named after him). Once the

        the seat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearic Islands‚</ENAMEX>Äô autonomous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
        When the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> promenade disperses, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> are usually quiet, dark, and practically deserted, though the
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pla√ßa de La Llotja and Pla√ßa la Reina</ENAMEX> teem with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. There is still more action if you head west to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es</ENAMEX>
        Jonquet, once the fishermen‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, now full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clubs</ENAMEX> clustering under the old windmills which used to grind the city‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flour</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few hundred meters</NUMEX> inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Jonquet</ENAMEX>, the Poble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espanyol</ENAMEX> is a rather kitschy walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of scaled-down replicas of
        Spanish architectural treasures from across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">famed Alhambra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings house</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studios</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>,
        and caf√©s.
        Just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poble Espanyol</ENAMEX>, perched on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> amid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pine trees</ENAMEX> and parkland, is the fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castell de Bellver</ENAMEX> (Bellver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX>). A magnificent example of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> military architecture, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castle</ENAMEX> has commanded the sea and land approaches to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> since its
        construction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 14th century</TIMEX> by order of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume</ENAMEX> II. The
        view from the circular battlements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> is
        stunning. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how the sloping roof funneled rainwater into the
        castle‚Äôs cisterns. Inside, there‚Äôs a small, well-laid-out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of the
        archaeology of the area.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAY OF PALMA</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> magnificent sweeps of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) long made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Palma‚Äôs bay</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a summertime</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-magnet, and the
        resorts that mushroomed along them gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> a name for cheap and
        cheerful holidays in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX> and ‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äò70s</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the picture
        has turned decidedly boozy and tacky. Athough the coast around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> is
        dominated by down-market package tourism, there are pockets of
        luxurious and expensive tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">villas</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Platja de Palma</ENAMEX>
        The southeastern shore of the bay runs through former
        fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> to the beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ca‚Äôn Pastilla</ENAMEX>,
        almost at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport runway</ENAMEX>. Then come Sometimes, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX>
        Maravillas, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S‚ÄôArenal</ENAMEX>, on a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4-mile</NUMEX>) strip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, fast food
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, high-throttle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX>, and German
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beerhalls</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> you‚Äôll have to pick your way across the beach through
        a sea of tightly packed bodies‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdespite the inconveniences, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platja de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> is an outstanding long (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.5 km/2.8 miles</NUMEX>) stretch of white
        sand.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Side of the Bay</ENAMEX>
        To the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala Major (‚Äúgreat</ENAMEX> cove‚Äù) was a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> long before the package-tour boom. The Catalan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">surrealist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Mir√≥</ENAMEX> was a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> of this area, and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fundaci√≥ Pilar</ENAMEX> i <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Mir√≥</ENAMEX> displays a fine selection of his work,
        as well as his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> as he left it, and his living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>, a mix of rocks and sand, continues west, past exclusive Bendinat
        up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portals Nous</ENAMEX>, where apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks cluster</ENAMEX> on the slopes. The
        glamorous-looking marina of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Punta Portals</ENAMEX> is not natural but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ambitiously</ENAMEX> carved out of the cliffs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy</ENAMEX> beaches start again at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôEn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blanes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova</ENAMEX>, which morphs into big, brash, and overwhelmingly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magalluf</ENAMEX>. The wide and sandy beach, sloping safely into the sea, is a
        solid block of bronzing bodies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. If you‚Äôre looking for a bit
        of tourism overkill, this is where you‚Äôll find it: bars a block long,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> built like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport terminals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> offering menus in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> languages from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Finnish</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, waterslides, go-karts‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou
        name it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magalluf</ENAMEX> has it. Everything but sanity.
        To the south, the once-quiet cove of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Vinjes</ENAMEX> (kah-la
        veen-juhs) has been practically buried in an orgy of concrete. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> for
        cover by continuing on through pine woods to narrow winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> to
        the pretty coves and beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portals Vells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pohr-tahls vays</NUMEX>). In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cliffs</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find huge rock-cut caverns dating from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times or
        earlier, enlarged over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Boats make the short excursion
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Magalluf</ENAMEX> beach (meaning it‚Äôs not always as peaceful as
        you might hope). Not far south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portals Vells</ENAMEX>, you can hike to a very
        quiet cove, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Figuera</ENAMEX>. Farther on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is blocked: the end of
        the peninsula is a military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WESTERN</ENAMEX> TIP
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> bypasses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> and
        meets up with the sea once again at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Pon√ßa</ENAMEX>, a modern villa that
        boasts one of the widest ranges of sports in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and keeps going
        during the off season with an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX>.
        The pleasantly tree-shaded beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Fornells</ENAMEX> are
        still picturesque, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and clusters of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">hacienda</ENAMEX>-style villas press closely round. A scenic but twisting little
        road leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAndratx, a broad, wonderfully sheltered bay that
        is home to more yachts than fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. The old harbor
        area on the south side keeps its traditional appearance, though a
        closer look reveals a string of chic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and the slopes facing
        it across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are encrusted with villas and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, most of
        which have now been bought up by wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> homes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudia Schiffer</ENAMEX> among them). Lack of a sandy beach has kept the big
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> away, which is just fine with most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. A short drive,
        brisk walk, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> jog takes you <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap de Sa</ENAMEX>
        Mola, the most southwesterly point o n the island, with its superb
        views of sheer cliffs and sparkling sea.
        From in-land <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Andratx</ENAMEX>, a dead-end road leads to the coast at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sant Elm</ENAMEX>, a former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> that doesn‚Äôt try too hard to be a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resort</ENAMEX>. The view offshore from its mostly stony little beaches is
        dominated by the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa Dragonera</ENAMEX>, said to look like a dragon
        rising from the sea, and subject of a long legal battle between
        would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservationists</ENAMEX>. The green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> appears to
        have protected the odd-shaped island.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORTHWEST</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COAST AND MOUNTAINS</ENAMEX>
        The most dramatic stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs coastline looks
        across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX> The rugged mountains of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de Tramuntana</ENAMEX> sweep down to the sea so steeply here that there
        are few points of access and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> and port of any size along
        the coast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> winds along clifftops and the sea, providing a
        series of vertigo-inducing viewpoints, and meandering back into the
        mountains. Interspersed among the cliffs are terraced orchards, olive
        groves, and photogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval villages</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Andratx</ENAMEX>, the coastal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">road C-710</ENAMEX> reaches the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of a succession of miradors, lookout
        points with a commanding prospect of the entire coast. Some of them are
        still crowned with an ancient watchtower, from which lookouts anxiously
        scanned the sea for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pirate ships</ENAMEX> and signaled warnings to the next
        point along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. If possible, make the trip <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>,
        or you‚Äôll be part of a procession from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> parking spot to the next.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mirador de Ricardo Roca</ENAMEX> provides enticing views of the coast
        looking north, but save some film, because they‚Äôre even better a bit
        farther on.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21/2 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roca</ENAMEX> lookout, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estellencs</ENAMEX> is a
        pretty, ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> amid terraces and orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX>. From town you can
        walk or drive down a track to a little fishing cove. Back on the main
        road, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estellencs</ENAMEX>, take in perhaps the finest
        view of the entire coast‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇquite an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">accolade‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfrom the snail</ENAMEX>-shaped
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mirador de Ses √Änimes</ENAMEX>. Green cliffs tumble
        into the stunningly blue <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> far as the eye can see on either
        side. The next town‚Äôs name is clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> in origin, and in fact the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hillsides</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Banyalbufar</ENAMEX> have been tamed since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> times into
        some of the finest (and most photographed) terraces on the island.
        Banyalbufar (‚Äúlittle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vineyard</ENAMEX> by the sea‚Äù) has a pair of pleasant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, making it a good place to spend the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. A small lane twists down to a rocky cove and small beach, while
        another reaches the sea at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port d‚Äôes Canonge</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Banyalbufar</ENAMEX>, the road turns inland for a while.
        Just off the road, in the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esporles</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Granja</ENAMEX>,
        a popular tourist attraction and good family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX> that is part stately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, part finca (traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX>), and part craft <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valldemossa</ENAMEX> was transformed by the short visit,
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half ago</TIMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Sand</ENAMEX> and her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fr√©d√©ric Chopin</ENAMEX>. Their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few weeks</TIMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1838‚Äì1839</NUMEX>
        seem to have been fairly miserable: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chopin</ENAMEX> was unwell, the weather was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wet</ENAMEX> and cold and bad for his chest, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Sand</ENAMEX> disparaged the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> in her book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Winter in Majorca</ENAMEX>, calling them ‚Äúbarbarians and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thieves</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äù She nicknamed Mallorca ‚ÄúMonkey Island</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">busloads</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> arrive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in this picturesque
        mountain village to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">couple‚Äôs lodgings</ENAMEX> in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carthusian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monastery La Cartuja</ENAMEX>. The monks were expelled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1835</TIMEX>, and some of
        their cells were sold as holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>. (The ‚Äúcells‚Äù were in fact
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suites</ENAMEX> with private gardens. ) The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cells the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>
        rented are now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, with original manuscripts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chopin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mask</ENAMEX>, and his piano. You‚Äôll see, too, the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, the monks‚Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacy</ENAMEX> with its collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> jars, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, and
        the guests‚Äô dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
        In great contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Sand‚</ENAMEX>Äôs negative impressions of
        Mallorca was the lifelong love affair that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian Archduke</ENAMEX> Ludwig
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salvator</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Salvador</ENAMEX>) had with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. In
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX> he bought the estate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Son Marroig</ENAMEX> just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dei√†</ENAMEX>, which he
        proudly proclaimed the most beautiful place on earth. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, open
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, is filled with his collections. In the gardens, take in
        the bird‚Äôs-eye view from the cliff-edge temple built out of Italian
        marble. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> below the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa Foradada</ENAMEX> (literally,
        ‚Äúrock with a hole in it‚Äù), a rocky promontory jutting into the sea,
        pierced by a remarkable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">60-ft-</ENAMEX>) wide natural window. If you feel
        energetic, hop the little fence just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Marroig</ENAMEX> and take the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-hour‚Äôs walk down to the sea and the landing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">archduke Salvator</ENAMEX> used to anchor his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dei√†</ENAMEX>, a gorgeous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey-colored stone</ENAMEX> and
        brightly painted shutters just east of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Marroig</ENAMEX>, has attracted
        plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and assorted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX> ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Graves</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, Claudius</ENAMEX>, came to live here with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Riding</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX> was pursued by a strange coterie of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">admirers</ENAMEX> and late
        in life became the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Old Man of Dei√†</ENAMEX>, fierce in his defense of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwest</ENAMEX> coast against touristic exploitation. He convinced the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourism</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, to declare the area a nature reserve.
        The picture-perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is extremely popular in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, when the
        year-round <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">613</NUMEX> swells with the trendy and chic who drive
        up rents by taking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dei√†.</ENAMEX> Besides fancy luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> in old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor houses</ENAMEX>, there are a couple of smart, low-cost alternatives, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the best rosters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the coast, making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dei√</ENAMEX>† an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> base for a few overnights. At the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, near the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>; a simple
        cement slab bears the inscription: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Graves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poeta</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1895‚Äì1985</NUMEX>.
        It‚Äôs a twisting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-mile</NUMEX>) drive down to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dei√</ENAMEX>†‚Äôs tiny
        fishing cove (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala de Dei√†</ENAMEX>), where ladder-like ramps come out of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boathouses</ENAMEX> set into the cliffs. A snack bar and a beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">caf√©</ENAMEX> open in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, but the rocky shore can get choked with seaweed and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">who‚Äôd</ENAMEX> hoped to find a private cove. Just beyond the turnoff to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala de</ENAMEX>
        Dei√† is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Llucalcari</ENAMEX>, which isn‚Äôt properly signposted; look for the sign
        that says, simply, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚ÄúHotel‚Äù</ENAMEX> off to the left side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. The tiny
        village has but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, several of them fortified with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coats</ENAMEX> of armor emblazoned on the doors, but if you‚Äôre up to an
        adventurous hike down the hill, hurdling a couple of gates property
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> have installed to ward off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll discover a rocky
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> of shoreline with pristine, transparent waters ideal for
        swimming.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√≥ller</ENAMEX> and its seaside twin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port de S√≥ller</ENAMEX>, the cliffs
        and mountains at last relent. The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bay</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwest</ENAMEX> coast
        makes a fine harbor, but both the water and the beach can be dirty.
        Sheltered slopes <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> inland are covered in groves of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lemon</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange</ENAMEX>, almond, and olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, with the island‚Äôs highest mountain,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puig Major</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,445 m. /4,740 ft</NUMEX>), as a rugged backdrop. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√≥ller</ENAMEX> is a
        busy, prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that claims, like several others, that it was the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√≥ller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> are linked by the narrow-gauge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√≥ller Railway</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>),
        polished wooden trains make the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour-long</TIMEX> journey in each direction
        through orchards and spectacular mountain scenery, stopping at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Son</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sardina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunyola</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:40am</TIMEX> tren tur√≠stico from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> takes in an
        extra scenic halt above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√≥ller</ENAMEX>, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> to snap their
        shutters before moving on (otherwise, the trip is the same, except for
        the price).
        In a valley of orange orchards and olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√≥ller</ENAMEX> is
        a compact little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of well-preserved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th- and 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>
        and agreeable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and convents. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√</ENAMEX>ßa
        Constituci√≥, is a good place to idle for a while and absorb the
        appealing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. A walk down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gran V√≠a</ENAMEX> reveals buildings
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> and neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX> flourishes, constructed during the
        town‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early-20th-century</TIMEX> expansion.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> tiny and handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S√≥ller</ENAMEX> have enticed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> to acquire many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval houses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fornalutx</ENAMEX> is a jewel
        of warm stone so immaculate that it won a national prize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>
        ago for spotlessness. Its steep cobblestone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are lined with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cacti</ENAMEX> and palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tramuntana</ENAMEX> mountains soar in the
        background. Similarly set among orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biniaraix</ENAMEX> is only a short stroll away down narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authorities</ENAMEX> felt that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√≥ller</ENAMEX>, with
        its hairpin bends and the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">496-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,627</NUMEX>-ft) pass, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coll de S√≥ller</ENAMEX>,
        was impeding development. In spite of vigorous protests from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX>, plans were approved for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road tunnel</ENAMEX> under the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountains</ENAMEX>, and digging began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. Travel time to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> has been
        reduced to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a half-hour</TIMEX>.
        On the southern slope, right opposite the tunnel entrance,
        are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardins</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAlfabia, a seigneurial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> and gardens that were
        once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> estate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish Vizier</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>, the
        cisterns, fountains, and irrigation channels are a tad run down, but
        the flowing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and shaded walks, turkeys feeding under <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fig trees</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds singing</ENAMEX> among exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> exude a gentle appeal. The house
        is like a forgotten <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, full of neglected treasures. Don‚Äôt miss the
        huge wooden <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> oak chair in the print <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, called by one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expert ‚Äúthe</ENAMEX> most important antique in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mallorca</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        The mountainous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to the east, reached via a lovely
        drive past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunyola</ENAMEX>, is a favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> and walkers based at the
        tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX> or on daytrips from the coast. A massive
        mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">crag</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">822 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,700 ft</NUMEX>) high is crowned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castell</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAlar√≥,
        a ruined fortress built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume</ENAMEX> I during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Moorish</ENAMEX> era. You can
        make the long walk from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX>, or drive most of the way to the summit
        up narrow and tortuous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, starting a little north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alar√≥</ENAMEX>. The
        higher they climb, the rougher and narrower the tracks get (but most
        standard rental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> are capable of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trek</ENAMEX>). There‚Äôs a restaurant
        and car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> off to the left. The final ascent is on foot, up rocky
        paths; wear sturdy walking shoes. Look for the sign that reads Castell
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peu</ENAMEX> (To the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> on foot). It‚Äôs a vigorous <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30- to 45-minute</TIMEX> climb.
        The gates and walls of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> still guard the clifftop, and the
        views of the mountains and surrounding plains are as thrilling as any
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>.
        Forced away from the sea by the steep terrain, the main
        road north from S√≥ller climbs over the high pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coll de Puig</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Major‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Mirador de Ses Barques</ENAMEX> has fine views of the coast and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de S√≥ller</ENAMEX>, as well as a restaurant‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorg Blau</ENAMEX>. Near the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX>, a little road leads to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>. Its name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sa Calobra (‚Äúthe snake‚Äù</ENAMEX>), gives a hint of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) of hairpin bends that have now become a tourist attraction in
        themselves; one loop is so exaggerated that the road passes under
        itself in a knot. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> is the best time to avoid the traffic
        (the most harrowing part of the descent is avoiding road-hogging,
        dangerous looking tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>). As a reward at the bottom of the
        winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala de Sa Calobra</ENAMEX> has a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and
        a pebbly beach, but all tend to be overcrowded with daytrippers. The
        main objective is the deep gorge of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Torrent de Pareis (‚Äúthe twins‚Äù</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tunnels</ENAMEX>, enlarged from natural crevices in the rock, burrow through to
        the riverbed where the gorge widens into a natural theater (concerts
        are given on some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer evenings</TIMEX>).
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monasteri de Lluc, Mallorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most revered place of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pilgrimage</ENAMEX>, foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are for once frequently outnumbered by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, sequestered in a valley near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puig des</ENAMEX>
        Castellot mountain, was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, but the massive
        buildings you see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today date</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th and 18th centuries</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Islanders</ENAMEX> come to see and pray to a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moreneta</ENAMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúlittle dark one‚Äù), so called because of its dark stone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX>. If you can attend mass in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, you may hear the famous
        Lluc boys‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Blavets (‚Äúthe</ENAMEX> blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ones‚Äù</ENAMEX>), named after the color
        of their cassocks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> is a popular place with inexpensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accommodations</ENAMEX>, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NORTHEAST</ENAMEX>: CAPES AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAYS</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwest coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">isn‚</ENAMEX>Äôt short on beauty or drama, but
        beaches are few and far between. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who seek beach time in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mallorca‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇa pretty reasonable desire, after all‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbeeline for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northeast</ENAMEX> coast and its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> great sandy bays, which have picturesque
        mountainous backdrops and are within easy striking distance of the
        historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> Pollen√ßa and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√∫dia</ENAMEX>, as well as the protected wetlands
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s‚ÄôAlbufera.</ENAMEX> The bays of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollen√ßa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√</ENAMEX>∫dia are lively and full of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, many of them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, during a long and hospitable summer
        season.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pleasant Port de Pollen√</ENAMEX>ßa is the kind of place that, in
        contrast to much of the south, gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> a good name‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwith a
        perfectly sheltered, gently sloping sandy beach, a decent spectrum of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, hostals, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, and villas, good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood restaurants</ENAMEX>, and
        relaxed nightlife options. Wedged in between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rocky promontories,
        it‚Äôs a scenic place with luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> in the harbor and flotillas of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">windsurfers</ENAMEX> in the bay.
        Nearly every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to these parts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ventures</ENAMEX> a bit farther
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northeast</ENAMEX> to the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cliffs of Pen√≠nsula de Formentor</ENAMEX>, the
        narrow headland jutting out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">13 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>) on the north side of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bay</ENAMEX>. The best place to take in the extraordinary lunar landscape is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirador de Mal Pas</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21/2 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port de Pollen√ßa</ENAMEX> along
        an adventurous, twisting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Sheer cliffs plunge dramatically to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, and the cape juts out to sea. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> also
        stop at the pretty, pine-shaded beach (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platja de Formentor</ENAMEX>), a favorite
        spot for a picnic and swimming. The beach enjoys splendid views across
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Badia de Pollen√ßa‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe same you‚Äôd get with a night‚Äôs stay at the
        exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Formentor</ENAMEX>, whose manicured gardens are visible from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>.
        From the turnoff to beach parking, it‚Äôs another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.5 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) to the lighthouse out on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap de Formentor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, swamped
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, bicyclists, and tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, can be tortuous, as they all try
        to squeeze into the tiny parking lot at the top. As great as the views
        are, on a crowded day it may be advisable to turn off after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2.5 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) from the top. There you‚Äôll find a single <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trek path</ENAMEX> down to Cala
        Figuera, a tiny cove with piercingly blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> and a small beach
        framed by the rocky masses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentor</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few miles</NUMEX> inland from the sea, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollen√ßa</ENAMEX> was founded in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1230</TIMEX> after the defeat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1802</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> belonged to the
        Order of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights of St. John</ENAMEX>, whose influence is evident in many
        handsome stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a tranquil,
        inviting atmosphere, especially at the outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√</ENAMEX>ßa
        Major.
        Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollen√</ENAMEX>ßa‚Äôs tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pont Roman</ENAMEX> is really
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> is questionable, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> say so, and it certainly looks
        the part. But the town‚Äôs principal sight is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Crucis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Way of the</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>), a long, steep climb of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">365</NUMEX> steps, lined with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">365</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress trees</ENAMEX>,
        that lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Calvari</ENAMEX> and the venerated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with a rhyming name,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mare de D√©u del Peu de la Creu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother of God</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foot</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>). If you‚Äôre driving, there‚Äôs also a road up, which passes the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stations of the Cross</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the finest walks on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> can be made only on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saturdays</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollen√ßa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> north, taking the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ternelles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Cars</ENAMEX> usually can go just a short distance before reaching a
        checkpoint where they have to turn back. However, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> during
        spring and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landowners</ENAMEX> open their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfrontier‚Äù</ENAMEX> to allow only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">walkers</ENAMEX> to go through (even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclists</ENAMEX> are prohibited). The route follows
        the gorge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Torrent de Ternelles</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, then turns off to head
        for the ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castell del Rei</ENAMEX>, built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> on a soaring crag
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">500 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,640 ft</NUMEX>) above the sea. Another rough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> leads down to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shore</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Castell</ENAMEX>. The entire hike is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 13 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 miles</NUMEX>).
        Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollen√ßa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port de Pollen√</ENAMEX>ßa is the turnoff for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Sant Vicen√ß</ENAMEX>, a gleaming resort situated ar ound <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gorgeous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sandy</ENAMEX> coves with brilliant blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, excellent for swimming and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snorkeling</ENAMEX>. The setting, framed by the craggy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de Comayaques</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Morral</ENAMEX> mountains, is spectacular‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇexcellent for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and
        day <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>.
        Astride the neck of land between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay of Pollen√ßa</ENAMEX> and
        the even more expansive <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√∫dia</ENAMEX> stands the ancient walled town
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√∫dia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> inhabited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c. The Romans</ENAMEX> then built their capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pollentia</ENAMEX>, here. Too close to
        the sea for safety from raids, it must have depended on its impressive
        fortifications for protection (the massive walls you see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> are mere
        imitations of the originals. ) The sturdy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of Sant Jaume
        forms the southern bastion in the walls.
        Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that circles the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> you can see the low
        ruins remaining from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Pollentia</ENAMEX>. They‚Äôre not impressive as such
        sites go, but some fine relics excavated here are now displayed in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">little Museu Monogr√†fic</ENAMEX>, a nicely restored building opposite Sant Jaume
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX>. Just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√</ENAMEX>∫dia to its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teatre Rom√†</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> theater), hewn out of solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> in the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">century b.c.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Port d‚ÄôAlc√∫dia</ENAMEX> has evolved from a small fishing harbor into
        an all-purpose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for commercial, naval, and pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> (there‚Äôs
        a big yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>) and the largest summer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mallorca</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> have multiplied, as have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and apartment
        blocks, which now spread around the bay to form an almost unbroken
        ribbon of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) long. Platja d‚ÄôAlc√∫dia in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> a
        solid block of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> soaking up the sun. Though big and crowded, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resort</ENAMEX> remains pretty low-key, a good option for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with restless
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remarkably</ENAMEX>, so close to a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, lie the precious
        wetlands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S‚</ENAMEX>ÄôAlbufera are a haven for birdlife. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drainage</ENAMEX> plans in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th century</TIMEX> ran into such problems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> company
        responsible for a network of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>, paths, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bridges‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇstill</ENAMEX> to be
        seen today‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwent bust. Much of the bay was originally surrounded by
        swampland, until development plans prompted large-scale reclamation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S‚ÄôAlbufera</ENAMEX> was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beneficiaries</ENAMEX> of the new environmental
        consciousness in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mallorca</ENAMEX>. You can now walk or cycle among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hectares</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 acres</NUMEX>) of wetlands and dunes that have been designated
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parc Natural</ENAMEX> (nature reserve), keeping a lookout for some of the more
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> that have been spotted here.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EAST COAST</ENAMEX>: COVES AND <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAVES</ENAMEX>
        Mallorca‚Äôs eastern coastline attracts nearly as many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX>-seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> as the extended <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> in the southwest.
        It‚Äôs generally less seedy, if not much less crowded. Tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">harbors</ENAMEX>, some
        no more than a cleft in the cliffs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alternate</ENAMEX> with larger bays. Here
        and there, great clusters of villas are transformed from ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to
        boom <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> as soon as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> arrives.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala Ratjada</ENAMEX> is about as far as you can get from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>
        without having to take to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is what most people
        are here for, whether it‚Äôs the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">catamaran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>, or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> is lively but undistinguished in
        appearance. Only the tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">971/56 30 33</NUMEX>) can
        arrange a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Joan March Sculpture Garden</ENAMEX>, on the grounds of
        the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> collected important works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Caro</ENAMEX>, and many modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX>.
        Fine sandy beaches are close by at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Gat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala Molt√≥</ENAMEX>,
        though most of the bathers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Platja Son Moll</ENAMEX>, lined by large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>. Up on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Capdepera</ENAMEX> there‚Äôs a lighthouse with fine views of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>. If it‚Äôs clear, you‚Äôll be able to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menorca</ENAMEX>. The cape takes its
        name from nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capdepera</ENAMEX>, a storybook <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with crenellated
        battlements of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castell de Capdepera</ENAMEX>) on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
        The agreeable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art√†</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) inland,
        seems far removed from the tourism that rules farther down the coast.
        Steps lead up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Way of the Cross</ENAMEX> to the fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santuari de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sant Salvador</ENAMEX>, where you are rewarded with a fine view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hills</ENAMEX>, and coast.
        A sign pointing down a side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in the southern outskirts
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art√†</ENAMEX> says simply ‚ÄúTalaiot,‚Äù but it leads to one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Megalithic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ses Paisses</ENAMEX>.
        Some distance away on the coast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art√†</ENAMEX> has given its name to
        the limestone caves called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Coves d‚ÄôArt√†</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coves de Drac</ENAMEX>, further
        down the eastern coast, get more fanfare, but the less commercial Art√†
        caves allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to get closer and better appreciate the awesome
        formations that have been brewing for millennia. Colored lights and
        Bach‚Äôs organ music point up the name given to the lowest level, ‚ÄúThe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inferno</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Jules Verne</ENAMEX> is said to have been inspired by a visit here to
        write <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Journey</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center of the Earth</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of caves in the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Cristo</ENAMEX> make a
        cool change from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beach‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> attract an interminable procession of
        tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>. The overcommercialized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coves del Drac</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caves</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon</ENAMEX>), to the south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, contain <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost 2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than</NUMEX> a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mile</ENAMEX>) of huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> and spectacular formations, as well as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">unquestionable highlight‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa 177</ENAMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">581-ft-</ENAMEX>) long underground lake
        named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edouard-Alfred Martel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speleologist</ENAMEX> who explored
        the caves in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1896</TIMEX>. There‚Äôs no denying the grandeur of the formations
        and their atmospheric lighting. The grand finale seems spectacular to
        some and completely unnecessary to others: The lights in the
        amphitheater dim and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three rowboats</TIMEX> decked out with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> lights
        paddle out to the middle of the lake, one with an organist and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">violinists</ENAMEX> playing classical music. If you wish, after the concerto you
        can hop one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> yourself and go for a little spin across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        Cala d‚ÄôOr came early to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort business</ENAMEX>, and it has now
        evolved into a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> encompassing several individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coves</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>, with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and watersports you could ask for. In
        contrast, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Petro</ENAMEX> still looks like a traditional fishing
        village, though it, too, is not immune from the summertime tourist
        invasion.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala Mondrag√≥</ENAMEX> is practically undeveloped (by the standards
        of coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>), and may stay that way by order of the regional
        government, which has become alarmed by the specter of unchecked
        building along the coast. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the gems that first attracted visitors
        to this part, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Figuera</ENAMEX> is still delightful, with neat
        green-and-white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and unpretentious <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> lining its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX>-shaped
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inlet</ENAMEX>.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SOUTH</ENAMEX>
        Until recently, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> knew (or wanted to know)
        anything of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs deep south. Many of the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> that do
        exist are mundane, while large sections of the shoreline are simply
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhospitable</ENAMEX>. The long sandy beach and dunes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Trenc</ENAMEX>, the south‚Äôs
        best beach, were left to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> to enjoy. The situation is
        changing somewhat, but it appears that major development won‚Äôt be
        permitted.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap de Ses Salines</ENAMEX>, the island‚Äôs southernmost point, takes
        its name from the local salt flats and ponds, where many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-watchers
        gather in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX> on the way north from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Col√≤nia de Sant Jordi</ENAMEX> is lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and villas, but it seems a
        rather half-hearted attempt at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. The nearby harbor serves as
        the starting point for trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabrera</ENAMEX>, a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> usually visible
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) to the south. Visits are limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> or zoologists and to excursion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala Pi</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capocorp Vell</ENAMEX>,
        the most remarkable of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mallorca‚Äôs Megalithic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>, situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Blanc</ENAMEX> on the road towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Llucmajor</ENAMEX>. From as early
        as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> b.c. massive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> were being cut and hauled into place to
        build a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five talaiots</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> round <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two square</NUMEX>) may
        have been added later.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTERIOR</ENAMEX>
        The name given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca‚Äôs</ENAMEX> vast interior, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Pla</ENAMEX> (‚Äúthe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plain‚Äù</ENAMEX>), may not sound promising. And in fact, it doesn‚Äôt slow down the
        great majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who stampede across the middle of Mallorca
        in a mad dash to their assigned piece of coastline. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Es Pla</ENAMEX> is lightly
        populated and little geared toward tourism. Still, there are lovely
        agricultural landscapes with ancient stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fincas</ENAMEX> (farmhouses),
        terraced olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> who still plough with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>, leisurely
        back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, and unassuming old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs an area best covered by your
        own transportation, either automobile or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> is the attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binissalem</ENAMEX>,
        the epicenter of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca‚Äôs</ENAMEX> wine industry (which earned a Denominaci√≥n
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">de Origen‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇa quality designation similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Apellation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d‚ÄôOrigine‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin 1991</ENAMEX>). The town features a number of attractive
        townhouses dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th and 18th centuries</TIMEX>. Farther along the
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> heading northeast is the unattractive industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inca</ENAMEX>, center of the leather industry. The best reason to visit is to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shop</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory outlets</ENAMEX>. Inca‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> market sprawls through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streets</ENAMEX>, and tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> arrive in flotillas, even though the goods are
        much the same as in other markets on the island.
        Just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inca</ENAMEX> is the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caimari</ENAMEX>, worth a
        quick detour to take in the amazing hillside of terraced olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX>,
        neatly layered among ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>.
        Sineu, practically at the center of the island, is probably
        the pick of inland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. Built on the site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume II</ENAMEX> chose to
        build a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> (which survives, now much altered, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>), Sineu
        has an elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, some attractive seigneurial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, and a
        pleasant central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> with some good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> is market
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Pla</ENAMEX> for fresh produce and
        livestock.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Felanitx</ENAMEX>, the honey-colored church <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Miquel</ENAMEX> dates in
        part from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>. In the street adjacent is a stone tablet
        commemorating a tragedy: During an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> procession in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1844</TIMEX>, the
        collapse of a wall killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">414</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Felanitx</ENAMEX> is the starting point
        for a bracing trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castell de Santueri</ENAMEX>, a ruined hilltop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> that
        was fortified by every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. Take
        the exhilarating walk round the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ramparts‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthere‚</ENAMEX>Äôs nothing between you
        and a dizzying precipice. The views of the coast are superb, and on a
        rare clear day you‚Äôll see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, too.
        On the next hill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">north‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> unless you‚Äôre a serious

        The capital and largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mah√≥n</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>), and
        the former capital Ciutadella are on opposite coasts. Resort
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is restricted to a handful of coves and beaches on the

        many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Talaiotic</ENAMEX> monuments are scattered across the island, though

        Ma√≥
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> is the business and administrative capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>,
        but it remains, above all, a port. ‚Äú The best <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> in the
        Mediterranean are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥,‚Äù</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX>
        Venetian admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Doria</ENAMEX>, noting that beyond the summer sailing
        season, a fleet couldn‚Äôt do better than <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> here. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6-km-</TIMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4-mile-</NUMEX>) long, deep-water natural harbor, guarded by forts at its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mouth</ENAMEX> and shielded from the winds by surrounding hills, caught the eye
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Royal Navy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the 18th century</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1708</TIMEX>, during
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of the Spanish Succession</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> seized the island for
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, and kept possession until temporarily losing it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1756</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> occupation, on and off until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1802</TIMEX>, left its mark.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorcan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX> production has thrived
        ever since (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>). Parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥‚</ENAMEX>Äôs old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> appear straight out
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa de Sa Pla√</ENAMEX>ßa
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hannover</ENAMEX>), resemble <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portsmouth</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plymouth</ENAMEX>.
        The only way to enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> is by foot. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is clustered
        on a cliff; near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a twisting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costa de Ses Voltes</ENAMEX>)
        and flights of broad ceremonial steps lead down to the quays and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> sight is its beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX>, and the enjoyable promenade and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and pastel-colored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that line it.
        At the top level, follow your nose to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Pla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> market, where you‚Äôll see more varieties of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">octopus</ENAMEX> and squid
        than you knew existed. Adjacent are a produce market and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, housed
        in the vast cloisters (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claustre del Carme</ENAMEX>) of a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX>, selling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abarcas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Menorcan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant shoes</ENAMEX>), jewelry, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous Mah√≥n
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>. Made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cow‚Äôs milk</ENAMEX> with a small percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheep‚Äôs milk</ENAMEX>,
        varieties range from the young and mild to a hard-skinned and almost
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crystalline</ENAMEX>, long-matured version rivaling the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Parmesan</ENAMEX>.
        The chief landmark in this area, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de la Conquesta</ENAMEX>,
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Mar√≠a</ENAMEX>, a large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> space under a vaulted
        roof. Rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, it was equipped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1810</TIMEX> with a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX>) is graced by a clock presented by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Kane</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1713‚Äì1736</ENAMEX>),
        Menorca‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elegant Carrer Isabel II</ENAMEX>, a long string of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>
        overlooking the harbor, leads to leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque church Esgl√</ENAMEX>©sia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Francesc</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu de Menorca</ENAMEX>. The fa√ßade of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Francesc</ENAMEX>,
        completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, conceals a delightful Churrigueresque
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel of the Immaculate Conception</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the best on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excels</ENAMEX> in its prehistoric and classical artifacts, which depict the
        fascinating history of the island.
        Between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and town hall, amid Ma√≥‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of
        narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Sant Roc</ENAMEX>, one of the original city
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gates</ENAMEX>.
        The legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX> can be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">seen‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand tasted‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇat the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoriguer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">distillery</ENAMEX>, west of the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Established in the 18th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">distillery</ENAMEX> still operates, and you can look through big
        windows at copper stills bubbling away, producing a hot, colorless
        spirit, which is poured over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juniper berries</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>. You can
        sample any number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liqueurs</ENAMEX> produced here, including calent (spiced
        with saffron and cinnamon) and hierbas dulces, a bright green liquid
        (and acquired taste) that restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> may force upon you at
        meal‚Äôs end.
        Take a stroll along the quayside, past the foot of the
        main steps, along <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moll de Levant‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇwhere most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
        are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">located‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand you‚</ENAMEX>Äôll turn the corner into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Figuera</ENAMEX> (called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúEnglish Cove‚</ENAMEX>Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Navy</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Club Mar√≠tim</ENAMEX>,
        where pleasure craft congregate near the ships‚Äô chandlers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> that cater to them.
        If you have time, take a glass-bottomed cruise from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">port</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Figuera</ENAMEX> for the best views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX>, the harbor islands, and
        the forts on the shore. High in the hills of the north side is an
        imposing pinkish-colored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Anton√≠.</ENAMEX> Part <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> and
        part‚ÄÇSpanish style, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> is better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Farm</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> is privately owned, so you‚Äôll have to admire it from a
        distance.
        Looking out over the harbor mouth toward vast fo
        rtifications on the opposite side (still used as a military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castell</ENAMEX> (also called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villacarlos</ENAMEX>) appears even more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX>.
        There are some lively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moll de Sant Fonts</ENAMEX> at
        the waterfront, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala de Sant Fonts</ENAMEX>, a boardwalk cleaved into
        the rock framing the harbor, makes for a delightful stroll.
        Excursions from Ma√≥: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX>
        If you set out from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ma√≥</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of many Talaoitic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monuments</ENAMEX> is found near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> limit, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trepuc√≥</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> south
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Llu√≠s.</ENAMEX> The talaiot and taula at the site have been slightly
        damaged, not least when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> fortified it and mounted guns
        to fire on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort San Felipe</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Lluis</ENAMEX>, a little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of checkerboard <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">all-white</ENAMEX>, typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Menorcan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, was built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> as
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Seven Years‚Äô War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1756‚Äì1763</ENAMEX>).
        The southeast, with its small sandy beaches, clear water,
        and proximity to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, was one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to be
        developed for tourism. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S‚ÄôAlgar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAlcaufar, villas cluster
        near a rocky shore, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punta Prima</ENAMEX> has a sandy but often unkempt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>.
        Though there‚Äôs little to distinguish many of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts, Binibeca Vell</ENAMEX> (also spelled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binib√®quer Vell</ENAMEX>) is something
        different. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vell</ENAMEX> means ‚Äúold,‚Äù which in this case is a misnomer. Inspired
        by a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Menorcan</ENAMEX> fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> created
        this sun-splashed ‚Äútoy-town‚Äù of brilliant white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and dark wooden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beams</ENAMEX> and shutters in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>.
        Just up the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binebeca</ENAMEX> are some of the
        southeast‚Äôs finest beaches and swimming waters. Literally right next
        door is an area known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ollas‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> name means ‚Äúfrying
        pans,‚Äù perhaps pertaining to the circular shape of this natural
        swimming hole carved by the sea. More likely, though, the sobriquet
        refers to the sound of the continually moving waters, sloshing against
        a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> basin like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauces bubbling</ENAMEX> in a pan. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúpools‚Äù</ENAMEX> are
        popular with nudist bathers.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> makes detours inland on its way west to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts of Binidal√≠</ENAMEX> and fine protected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coves</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala de Biniparratx</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala de Binidal√≠.</ENAMEX> Both are small enough and sufficiently off the beaten
        path that you‚Äôre unlikely to encounter large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. The former has a
        platform at the edge of the sea, which provides excellent views of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> and back at the small cove. To get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala de Biniparratx</ENAMEX>, park
        your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> and walk along a beautiful path through a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canyon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> to a narrow cove. The beach is sheltered by steep
        cliffs that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house ancient cave dwellings</ENAMEX>.
        Farther west along the coast is another spate of massive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Cala en <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porter</ENAMEX> is one of the largest, oldest-established,
        and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, loudest holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>. This villa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">town‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcalled</ENAMEX> an urbanitzaci√≥‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis resolutely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. If you‚Äôre
        looking for a pint of bitters and an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football game</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll have
        no trouble finding it. Steps lead down the hill through sprawling
        development to a rather nice, but crowded, sandy beach. Nearby is Cova
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">d‚ÄôEn Xoroi a cave</ENAMEX> carved in the steep cliff that has been converted
        into a disco. You can dance <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> away above a vertiginous drop to
        the crashing sea. For those who are curious but not nocturnal, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enterprising</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> allows afternoon visits for a reduced cover
        charge.
        In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala‚ÄôEn Porter</ENAMEX>, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cales Coves</ENAMEX> is
        undeveloped. Although no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> survive, there‚Äôs evidence that it
        was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cales Coves</ENAMEX> is best known, however, for its
        amazing collection of caves‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇperhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">more‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇburrowed</ENAMEX> out
        of the cliffs. You can see the openings of caves once used as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necropolises</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chambers</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Talaiotic</ENAMEX> period; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> some of
        them provide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dropouts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backpackers</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Coast</ENAMEX>
        Wild, rocky, and deeply indented, much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast
        can‚Äôt be reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> at all. Immediately north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fav√†rritx</ENAMEX>, a barren cape with a lighthouse. Down the coast is the
        attractive beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Presili</ENAMEX> and, inland, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S‚ÄôAlbufera</ENAMEX>, a wetlands
        nature reserve distinguished by a freshwater lake, migrant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, and
        sand dunes. From the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Grau</ENAMEX>, with beaches and swimming
        waters popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs possible to hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to go to the
        beaches of rocky <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Illa d‚ÄôEn Colom</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pigeon Island</ENAMEX>).
        The twin coves of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">d‚ÄôAddaia‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnow</ENAMEX> a holiday village
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">harbor‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇwere the site of the last <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> invasion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1798</TIMEX>, by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Highland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> who probably thought these rocky hillsides
        covered with purple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">heather</ENAMEX> were just like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. You can drive down to
        the sea at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few</TIMEX> places, and inevitably some of these have
        developed rapidly into sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Na Macaret</ENAMEX> was an old fishing
        village, and much of the new development seeks to imitate a traditional
        look, especially around the neat little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. Arenal d‚ÄôEn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castell</ENAMEX> has
        a beautiful circular bay, almost enclosed and with a wide sandy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>.
        Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Parc</ENAMEX>, near a big, flat sandy beach backed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dunes</ENAMEX>, is an artificial creation centered around a golf club, the only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its kind on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>. For greater authenticity, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> back to the
        Ma√≥-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fornells</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and onto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fornells</ENAMEX>, which remains a real fishing
        village. This low-key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, a good base for exploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>,
        is lined by pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and ballyhooed seafood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> along the
        waterfront. The inlet‚Äôs sheltered coastline and shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> make it
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> for sailing and windsurfing.
        For geological extremes, take the rough and pothole-ridden
        track to the most northerly point on the island, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap de Cavaller√≠a</ENAMEX>.
        It‚Äôs passable by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, with a farm gate to open and close, and leads
        past the site of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanitja</ENAMEX>.
        Walk along the sheer drop of the clifftop near the lighthouse for
        breathtaking views.
        Back down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hellish road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">cape</ENAMEX>, and due west, is
        the isolated beach <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Platja Binimella</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorcans</ENAMEX> favor the orange-tinged
        sand-and-pebble beach on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. But if it‚Äôs beaches you‚Äôre after,
        you cannot do better on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menorca</ENAMEX> (or just about anywhere) than Cala
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pregonda</ENAMEX>. You can only get here by scrambling over the hills just west
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binimella</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> later, having passed through a desert
        landscape, you will have discovered paradise: a spectacular sandy beach
        framed by a lush pine forest and stalagmite-like sea stacks rising out
        of impossibly transparent waters.
        West from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ma√≥: Taloitic Monuments and Inland Towns</ENAMEX>
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ma√≥</ENAMEX>, plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> blitz right across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ciutadella‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇonly <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 miles</NUMEX>) and a direct shot, it takes less
        than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>. The busy main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> runs
        parallel to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> built by order of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cam√≠ d‚ÄôEn Kane</ENAMEX>. The scenic and well-paved old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> passes a number of
        handsome haciendas. Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaior</ENAMEX>, the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is superimposed on
        the old route.
        Near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ma√≥</ENAMEX>, you can begin a tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs mysterious
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,000-year-old</TIMEX> megalithic sites. Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ma√≥</ENAMEX>, a
        lavender sign to the left points down a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talat√≠ de Dalt</ENAMEX>. Hop the
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> and walk through groves to discover an elegantly slim taula
        with a fallen stone supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">base‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich</ENAMEX> has led some to
        speculate that it was formed this way for a reason. (In all likelihood,
        the piece merely fell). Next to the taula is a dark columned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and
        nearby burial caves. The settlement here dates to the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze</ENAMEX>
        Age, around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1400</TIMEX> b.c.
        Back on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, a little farther west, keep an eye
        on the fields on the north side. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">You‚Äôre</ENAMEX> looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rafal Rub√≠</ENAMEX>, a site
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> shaped like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">upturned boats</ENAMEX>, navetas
        (prehistoric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chambers</ENAMEX>). These were collective ossuaries, used
        for secondary burials of bones. If you crawl through the low doorway of
        the better-restored naveta, you can appreciate the spacious interior,
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7 ft</ENAMEX>) high, with shelves at each end. The other naveta is
        more of a ruin, but worth seeing for the beautifully recessed stone
        door frame, evidently designed to take a stone or wooden door.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the road, and most easily accessible by the
        narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaior</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala En Porter</ENAMEX>, is the fascinating Talaoitic
        complex <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Torralba d‚ÄôEn Salord</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torralba</ENAMEX> has perhaps the most beautiful
        taula of all‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcertain evidence that the ancients were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of the
        art of stone construction. Recent excavations and radiocarbon dating
        put the taula‚Äôs date at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">b.c. The ‚ÄúHypostyle hall‚Äù</ENAMEX> has one of
        the few intact stone roofs supported by columns. This site is one of
        the only ones on the island to charge admission and keep set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hours</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaior</ENAMEX>, a mass of white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> clustered on a
        low hill, looks at a distance like an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Andalusian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. The
        old section of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, at the top, is the most attractive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>. Alaior
        is famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>-making industry; stop at either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coinga</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Payesa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> for a sample of queso <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Mah√≥n</ENAMEX>. To the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>,
        a long, sandy, gently sloping beach and sand dunes have brought
        obtrusive high-rise hotel and villa developments to the south coast at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Jaume</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platja de Son Bou</ENAMEX>. Besides waterslides and windsurfers,
        the outline of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">basilica</ENAMEX> discovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>, is visible
        next to the beach at its eastern end.
        A turnoff from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alaior‚ÄìSon Bou</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, signposted to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre d‚ÄôEn Gaum√©s</ENAMEX>, brings you to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest and most varied of
        Menorca‚Äôs prehistoric settlements. Don‚Äôt miss the hypostyle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, with
        its central supports and massive roof intact, or the water cisterns
        carved out in the soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandstone rock</ENAMEX>.
        Choose a clear day and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Mercadal</ENAMEX>, halfway along
        the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">east‚Äìwest highway</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 km/5 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaior</ENAMEX>). Here, climb the
        twisting but well-contoured road to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte El Toro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        highest peak. It‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 357 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,171 ft</NUMEX>) high, but provides excellent
        views of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.
        A horseshoe-shaped cove with white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX>
        water sheltered by cliffs and green pine woods has made the stunningly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beautiful Cala</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Galdana</ENAMEX> one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular holiday

        opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Gavilanes</ENAMEX> (disregard the sign that says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coto Privado</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Caza‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Äî‚ÄÇprivate</ENAMEX> hunting grounds) and walk <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> through the

        secluded but popular beach. If you try to drive here, you‚Äôll have to
        pay to travel the access road.
        Ciutadella
        Perhaps the most enchanting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ciutadella‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwith</ENAMEX> its sandstone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and cobblestone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streets‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇpreserves the flavor of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Until
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 18th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ciutadella (‚Äúlittle city‚Äù</ENAMEX>) was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, on the island mainly for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥‚</ENAMEX>Äôs harbor, moved the
        capital in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1722</TIMEX>. Ciutadella‚Äôs beautiful but narrow and shallow inlet
        simply could not compete.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pla√ßa Alfons III</ENAMEX>, on the eastern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, marks the
        spot where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ma√≥</ENAMEX> reached the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> gates. The gates are
        long gone, but the caf√©s around the square‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇincluding the atmospheric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Es Mol√</ENAMEX>≠ in an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">windmill‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇprobably</ENAMEX> began by refreshing thirsty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">travelers</ENAMEX>. Locals flood the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early evening</TIMEX>. Join them on
        their paseo and stroll along the main, pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that
        bisects the old part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It takes various names, beginning as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrer de Ma√≥</ENAMEX>; at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa Pla√ßa Nova</ENAMEX> it becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrer J. Mar√≠a Quadrado</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">which‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe lovely Ses Voltes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis</ENAMEX> completely arcaded in
        Moorish style and lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pla√ßa de la Catedral</ENAMEX> is the stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic cathedral</ENAMEX>,
        begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX> on the site of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. The bishop‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX> adjoins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> is
        just across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. The pedestrian-only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Rodal</ENAMEX> area just south of the cathedral are replete with
        wonderful stonework, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buildings‚Äô honey color glowing gold</ENAMEX> as the sun
        goes down. Look especially for the carved doorway of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church Esgl√©sia del Roser</ENAMEX> down the side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Roser</ENAMEX> (across
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau Martorell</ENAMEX> and
        Can <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saura</ENAMEX>, diagonally across from each other on carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Santissim</ENAMEX>.
        Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Dioces√†</ENAMEX>, housed in a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent</ENAMEX> and cloisters
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carrer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seminari</ENAMEX>. It displays archaeological and ecclesiastical
        finds.
        The carrer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">del Born</ENAMEX> leads west from the cathedral to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">dignified Pla√ßa d‚Äôes Born</ENAMEX>, the ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on the heights above
        the harbor. Formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Moors‚Äô parade</ENAMEX> ground, it is lined with
        imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, such as the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajuntament</ENAMEX> (now the police
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>) and great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> (grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau</ENAMEX> Torresaura
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palau Salord</ENAMEX>). In the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, an obelisk commemorates
        a brave defense against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 15,000</NUMEX> besieging <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1558</TIMEX>. The town
        fell after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine days</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> were carried off into slavery.
        Concerts are still held at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Teatre del Born</ENAMEX> on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">north</ENAMEX> side of the pla√ßa.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pla√ßa d‚Äôes Born</ENAMEX>, you can view the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> below, a long
        curving inlet lined with fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and pleasure craft
        on the other. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, the focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ciutadella‚Äôs nightlife</ENAMEX>, teems with
        seafood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>.

        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, just off the south
        of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Naveta d‚ÄôEs Tudons</ENAMEX>, one of the island‚Äôs

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> intriguing taula <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are hidden not far away.
        Heading away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ciutadella</ENAMEX>, just after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naveta</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôEs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tudons</ENAMEX>, take the

        farm track to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torre Trencada</ENAMEX>. There is a signpost pointing across the
        fields to the taula and a huge cave. Back on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, take the
        next road turning south, through stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gateposts</ENAMEX> and across a farmyard,
        to the largely unexcavated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Torrellafuda</ENAMEX>, obscured by <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. From the
        talaiot there‚Äôs a wonderful view of the surrounding countryside,
        divided by rows and rows of stone walls.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> on the road towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Joan de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missa</ENAMEX> and branch off towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Saura</ENAMEX>; after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) you‚Äôll
        arrive at the prehistoric walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Catlar</ENAMEX>, situated in the
        farmland to the east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. You can walk round the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX>-m-
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,880</NUMEX>-ft-) long walls, which possibly date from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 600 b.c.</NUMEX> ,
        though on the southeastern side you can see places where, much later,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> built bastions. The taula seems to have been deliberately
        broken off, and it is possible that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> used the precinct as a

        Beaches and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX> near Ciutadella
        Almost every accessible cove and inlet on the coast near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> has been developed in a rash of urbanitzaci√≥s, creating a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rash</ENAMEX> of holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and associated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. The resorts
        are easily accessible, but their sprawl is dull and suburban. Beaches
        here are very small, and overcrowded in high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
        However, some of the island‚Äôs finest beaches, near the
        middle of the southern coast, are probably best visited from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> is reached only by narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm tracks</ENAMEX>,
        but it‚Äôs worth a trek to get away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. The twin coves of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macarella</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macarelleta</ENAMEX> are stunning, with the kind of calm turquoise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">waters</ENAMEX> and spectacular sea views <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> is known for. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macarella</ENAMEX> is
        perhaps the nicest fully serviced beach on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mallorca</ENAMEX>; the beautiful cove
        has an excellent bar-restaurant, open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. Macarelleta, a nudist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>, is lovelier still. To get to it, take the path to the right of
        Macarella, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> walk along the cliff.
        Occasionally there are times when so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the
        remote spots that they create a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> there, too. A favorite spot for
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> is pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala en Turqueta</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>)
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Joan de Missa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX> and south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX> are the busiest and dreariest
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Menorca‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santandria, Cala Blanca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArtrutx,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala</ENAMEX> en <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bos√ß.</ENAMEX> Just west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella, Cala Blanes</ENAMEX> and the vast
        area of villas and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cala Forcat</ENAMEX> make a self -contained
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, though their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> often scruffy little beaches can hardly
        cope with the summer influx.
        The northwest corner of the island, in total contrast, is
        almost untouched by tourism, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX> are winning
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> who want it declared off-limits for development. Some
        building at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Morell</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km/5 miles</NUMEX> northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciutadella</ENAMEX>) has
        jumped the gun, and a number of little white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and blocks of
        villas have sprouted on the eastern side of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the loveliest bays
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast. A maze of paths leads down to the rocky shore and
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cliffs‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa geology textbook</ENAMEX> of tortured strata. Carved into
        the rock above the bay is a prehistoric necropolis dating from the 6th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century b.c.</ENAMEX> , including a cell with a sculpted fa√ßade. The oldest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caves</ENAMEX>, though, are pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Talaoitic</ENAMEX>, dating from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> b.c. West of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Morell</ENAMEX> are the lovely, remote beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algaiarens</ENAMEX>.
