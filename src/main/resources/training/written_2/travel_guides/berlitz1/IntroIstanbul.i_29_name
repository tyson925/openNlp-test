        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> is one of the worldâ€™s most venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Part
        of the cityâ€™s allure is its setting, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> faces <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> acrÂ­oss
        the winding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise waters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>, making it the only city
        in the world to bridge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> continents.
        Here, where the waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Sea</ENAMEX> blend into the
        Aegean, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> mingle and merge in the cultural melting-pot of
        Turkeyâ€™s largest metropolis. Busy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX> bazaars <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">co-Â­exist</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kebab-shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> sit alongside
        international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>; modern office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> alternate
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> minÂ­arets along the cityâ€™s skyline; traditional music and
        Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pop</ENAMEX>, belly-dancing and ballet, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> wrestling and football
        all compete for the attention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbullu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>.
        This is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the world to have been the capital
        of both an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantinople</ENAMEX>, jewel of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, it was for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> the most
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Christendom</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> it was the seat of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> sultans, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 500-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> that stretched
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Sea</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> owes its long-held historical significance to a
        straÂ­tegic location at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>. From this vantage
        point the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> could control not only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> that passed through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">strait</ENAMEX> on the important trade route between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Sea</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, but also the overland traffic travelling from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inÂ­Â­to Asia Minor</ENAMEX>, which used the narrow strait as a crossing point. In
        the words of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveller</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Gilles</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">â€œThe</ENAMEX>
        Bosphorus with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key opens and closes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> worlds, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seas. â€
        That strategic advantage is no less important <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> than it
        was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,500 years ago</TIMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> first founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of
        Byzantium on this very spot. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ankara</ENAMEX> may be the official capital of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modern TurÂ­key</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Istanbul</ENAMEX> remains the countryâ€™s largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, most
        important commercial centre, and busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, producing more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Turkeyâ€™s manÂ­uÂ­Â­Â­facturing outÂ­Â­put</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> is one
        of the worldâ€™s most active shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, and the overland traffic is
        now carried by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the worldâ€™s longest suspension <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>.
        The thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has long since spread beyond the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> walls built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodosius II</ENAMEX>, and
        now sprawls for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> along the shores of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Marmara</ENAMEX> on both
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>. Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1507</TIMEX> this was the worldâ€™s largest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2 million</NUMEX>. That figure has now passed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> and is still growing, swollen by a steady influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> areas looking for work (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was born in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>). These new arrivals have created a series of
        shanty-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> around the perimeter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Their makeshift <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>,
        known in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gecekondu (â€œbuilt</ENAMEX> by nightâ€), take advantage of an
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> law that protects a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> whose roof has been built during
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of darkness. The slums are eventually knock-ed down to make
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> for new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>-blocksâ€‚â€”â€‚a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> is created, yet another
        shanty-town springs up beyond it, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> spreads out a little
        farther.
        At the other end of the social spectrum are the wealthy
        Istanbullus, who live in the upmarket <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taksim, Harbiye</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NiÂ«antaÂ«Ä±</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are lined with fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>,
        expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, and stylish cafÃ©s. Those belonging to this set
        are the lucky few who frequent the cityâ€™s more expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, and retire at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> to their restored wooden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mansions</ENAMEX> (yalÄ±) along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>. But most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbulâ</ENAMEX>€™s inhabitants
        fall between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extremes, living in modest flats and earning an
        average wage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> that provide
        most of the cityâ€™s employment.
        Although small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek Orthodox</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> survive, the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbullus</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>,
        and adhere to the principles known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â€œFive Pillars of Islamâ€â€‚â€”â€‚â</ENAMEX>€‚to
        believe with all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oneâ€™s heart</ENAMEX> that â€œThere is no God but God, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> is his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prophetâ€</ENAMEX>; to pray <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times a day, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, sunset, and after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dark</TIMEX>; to give alms to the poor, and
        towards the upkeep of the mosques; to fast between sunrise and sunset
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramadan</ENAMEX>; and to try to make the pilgrimage to Mecca
        at least once in oneâ€™s lifetime. Those who have made the pilgrimage can
        add the respected title haci before their names, an honour proudly
        displayed on shop-ownerâ€™s signs.
        Just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosphorus separates Asia</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, so the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inlet</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> separates the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Istanbul</ENAMEX> from the new.
        The main attractions for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> are concentrated in the historic
        heart of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> great civilizations have shaped this part
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cityâ€‚â€”â€‚Roman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>. Though little remains from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, the cityâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> legacy boasts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of the Divine Wisdom</ENAMEX> and one of the worldâ€™s greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>;
        the magnificent mosaics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Saviour</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chora</ENAMEX>; and the impressive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodosian Walls</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> built countless mosques in their
        capital, the finest of which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SÃ¼leymaniye</ENAMEX>, inspired by the form
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>. But the most popular tourist sight is TopkapÄ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> sultans, where the riches of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Treasury</ENAMEX> and the intrigue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX> draw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>.
        From the belvedere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan</ENAMEX> used to gaze down upon his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>, you can look across the mouth
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> to the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beyoâ€˜lu</ENAMEX>, where
        multi-storey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> rise beyond the turret of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Tower</ENAMEX>. Down by
        the shore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> is the glittering faÂ­Ã§ade of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">DolmabahÃ§e Palace</ENAMEX>, while beyond stretches the graceful
        span of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bosphorus Bridge</ENAMEX>, a concrete symbol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, linking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
        Byzantium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople, Istanbulâ</ENAMEX>€‚â€”â€‚down the centuries
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has been open to influences from both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, and this
        cross-fertilization of ideas has created one of the worldâ€™s liveliest,
        most engaging, and most hospitable cultures. It is neither <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> nor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oriental</ENAMEX>, but an unparalleled and intoxicating blend; it is, quite
        simply, unique.
