        Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People</ENAMEX>
        Exciting, mysterious, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">glamorous‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthese</ENAMEX> words have described
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a century</TIMEX>. With its vibrant atmosphere and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">night-and-day</TIMEX> activity it is an intoxicating place. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crowded‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit</ENAMEX> has one of the world‚Äôs greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> densities. But
        it is also efficient, with one of the best transportation systems
        anywhere, and for such a crowded place, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">quiet‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou don‚</ENAMEX>Äôt hear voices
        raised in anger, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">motorists</ENAMEX> sitting on their horns, or loud boomboxes.
        Shopping never ends‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthere‚Äôs always another inviting spot just down
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> easy to get around, the people
        helpful, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> spoken everywhere, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that lives up to its
        reputation.
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 July</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Crown Colony of Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
        reverted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> sovereignty as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Administrative Region</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People‚Äôs Republic of China</ENAMEX>. Today <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> remains a capitalist
        enclave with its laws and rights intact, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has promised that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> will continue in this fashion for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 50 years</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beijing‚Äôs</ENAMEX> announced policy of maintaining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs prosperity and
        stability makes sense. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> has long been China‚Äôs handiest window
        on the West, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is unrivaled in its commercial know-how and
        managerial expertise. Around the time of the transition there was much
        speculation about how things would change. But in fact, once news of
        the handover vanished from the front pages, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
        returned to their usual topics of conversation: the economy and the
        price of housing.
        The impression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> today will be that very little
        has changed. Establishments are no longer called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúRoyal</ENAMEX>,‚Äù Queen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> has vanished from the coinage, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Jack</ENAMEX> has been
        replaced by the flag of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> flag with its
        bauhinia flower. But in fact, there have been changes, many of them due
        to economic progress, new construction, and other factors that
        influence cities all over the world.
        Others are more subtle. British social <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> are still
        evident in the kind of polite service you get in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and in the long
        lines of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> population
        has decreased; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> there are as many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> ex-pats
        as there are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>.
        With a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly eight million</NUMEX> and a total area
        of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just over 1,095 square km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">423 square miles</NUMEX>), housing is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong</ENAMEX>
        Kong‚Äôs perennial nightmares. To alleviate the problem, the government
        has become the city‚Äôs major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> with the construction of massive
        apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> that, though they have every modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, average
        only <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 square m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 square ft</NUMEX>) in size. Whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> have been created
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Territories</ENAMEX>, although the unimaginative architecture of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> has been criticized.
        Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98 percent</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>. The
        majority are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cantonese</ENAMEX>, born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, or from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China</ENAMEX>, but
        there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have been
        described as hardworking and pragmatic, attitudes that have contributed
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs success. There are many stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> who arrived
        with nothing in their pockets, set up a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk stall</ENAMEX>, worked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diligently</ENAMEX> until they had their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, and then expanded it into a
        modest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.
        Old customs are still followed: Fate and luck are taken very
        seriously, and astrologers and fortune-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tellers</ENAMEX> do a steady business.
        Before a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper</ENAMEX> can be built, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">feng shui</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>)
        investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building
        will promote health, harmony, and prosperity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also notice that
        gambling is a passion, whether it be cards, mah-jong, the lottery, or
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major racetracks as well as an intensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">off-track betting</ENAMEX> system, and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> the ferries to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> are
        crowded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on their way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>.
        Sightseeing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> starts at sea level with the
        enthralling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water traffic‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa mix</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">freighters</ENAMEX>, ferries, tugs, junks,
        and yachts. Views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the harbor are panoramic. From
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Peak</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest point, or from skyscrapers and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, they are especially exciting at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when the lights are
        on.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and the signature soaring
        architecture are on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX>. Across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria Harbor</ENAMEX>, connected
        by ferry and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTR</ENAMEX> rail line, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kowloon</ENAMEX> peninsula with its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, nightlife, and almost non-stop shopping. Beyond, in the New
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Territories</ENAMEX>, are a mixture of high-rise suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, ancient sites
        and walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and fish
        ponds. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs other, less developed islands, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lantau, Lamma</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheung Chau</ENAMEX>, provide getaways. You can also take a ferry to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> to
        find an entirely different kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, a unique blend of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> culture.
        It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess what may happen in the future, but for
        now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> bristles with energy and ambition, and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>,
        this beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with its contrasts and variety is an exhilarating
        experience.
