        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prehistoric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> (now modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>
        could look out across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> toward the horizon and see the faint
        silhouette of land. Their curiosity pushed them to build <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> that
        were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands,
        marking the start of the long legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> seafaring.
        Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7000</TIMEX> b.c. , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> set out from what is now
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> to explore their surroundings. They eventually reached the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>, and founded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> on the islands in the northernmost part
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean Sea</ENAMEX>. An important early material, obsidian, was
        discovered on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obsidian</ENAMEX> is a hard, vitreous
        volcanic rock, which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stabbing</ENAMEX>. The high quality of the seam on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milos</ENAMEX> ensured that the area
        remained popular with early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>.
        The basic elements of life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> began to come
        together <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 5000</TIMEX> b.c. , and were already in place by the late
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 2700 b.c.</ENAMEX> ). The major changes were not to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> tasks
        and routines, but to the political power base, which changed regularly
        and not necessarily peacefully throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cycladic Culture</ENAMEX>
        At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 3500 b.c.</TIMEX> , a sophisticated culture evolved in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclades</ENAMEX> islands. The distinctive, sculpted marble figures of the era
        are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs. You will find
        original examples in the archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> throughout the
        Cyclades, although one of the earliest examples is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paros</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> farmed and fished; on the dawning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2700</TIMEX> b.c. , they began to work with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cycladic</ENAMEX> culture was
        influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> in the east, importing the pottery wheel from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX>. They also continued to trade in obsidian and the local
        marble.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minoans</ENAMEX> and the Myceneans
        Farther south in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> culture developed after
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> b.c. into the most significant of its age, spreading its influence
        throughout the region by trade and diplomacy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thira</ENAMEX>), the
        next major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> north, was heavily influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, and the
        settlements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thira</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akrotiri</ENAMEX> thrived at this time. The magnificent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frescoes</ENAMEX> and mosaics found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akrotiri</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> at present, but
        the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> at the site provide ample evidence of the
        sophistication of the culture here.
        Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX> b.c. , a massive volcanic eruption at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX>
        destroyed not only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Akrotiri‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇunder <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ash</ENAMEX> and pumice‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut the
        whole <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minoan</ENAMEX> civilization. Massive tidal waves swept over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crete</ENAMEX>, and
        other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, smashing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and drowning many
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
        In the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval, the Aegean
        Islands next came under the influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaeans</ENAMEX> (at around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1300</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">b.c.</ENAMEX> ), who had a base in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peloponnese</ENAMEX> region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mainland.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaeans</ENAMEX> were an acquisitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> who came to conquer, not to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>. Their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by
        Homer in his epic poems <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Odyssey and The Iliad</ENAMEX>.
        The Rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorians</ENAMEX>, who came overland from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Europe</ENAMEX>,
        conquered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycenaeans</ENAMEX>. They were a barbaric race, and their custody
        of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word
        was forgotten and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art</ENAMEX> disappeared. They held sway over islands off the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">northern Greek</ENAMEX> coast, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians</ENAMEX> kept control of the main sea
        routes; south of the area, trade continued as usual. At the same time,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">city-states</ENAMEX> began to grow in influence on the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mainland.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athens</ENAMEX> became the most powerful, heralding the start of the classical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> period. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> was not yet a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>; each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>-state
        was self-governing and autonomous.
        The new culture spread throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, helped
        by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carthage</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> coast of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>. Culture and the arts flourished once again. Athletic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prowess</ENAMEX> was admired and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic games</ENAMEX> were constituted in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">776 b.c.</TIMEX>
        , to promote friendly competition. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX> wrote his epic works on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chios</ENAMEX>;
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">lyrical</ENAMEX> poetry was much admired, particularly the work of the poets
        Archilochos on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Paros and Sappho on Lesvos</ENAMEX>.
        The preeminent islands of this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delos</ENAMEX>, a sacred
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX> and center of religion ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samos</ENAMEX>, ruled by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tyrant Polycrates</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naxos</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lygdamis</ENAMEX> undertook some major
        building projects. Archaeology shows that, during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, societies
        lived mainly in coastal trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> with little settlement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inland</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> Wars
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> rose in influence and power in the West, it was
        matched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> by the rise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Empire</ENAMEX>. From a power
        base in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> overran the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX> and
        set their sights on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclades</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">490 b.c.</TIMEX> , they captured sacred
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delos</ENAMEX> and razed the settlements on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naxos</ENAMEX>. The island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> were
        undecided about which side to back for a time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paros</ENAMEX> and Andros
        contributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> armory, while others supported <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">superpowers</ENAMEX> finally clashed at the epic battles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salamis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">480 b.c.</TIMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> were defeated, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> duly
        punished the islands that had turned against it.
        Following its victory, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> introduced the concept of a
        mutual protection alliance (a kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> of the ancient world).
        Several islands and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">city-states</ENAMEX> agreed to work together, and
        created a treasury to fund their plans, which was held on the island of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delos</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> became known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delian League</ENAMEX>. Although there
        were minor internal wrangles, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> controlled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">greater Athenian Empire</ENAMEX> for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century b.c. Later</TIMEX>, in
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">454 b.c.</TIMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX> was transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> and its deposits were
        used to finance the construction of many of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and
        temples of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classical Age</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">431 b.c.</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> began a war with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">league</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX>. Although the islands saw little action, as the
        war went on they could see that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> was slowly losing its power.
        Before the end of the war in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">401 b.c.</TIMEX> , many islands had already
        transferred their allegiance to the victors, who were led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macedon</ENAMEX>. He was followed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">336 b.c.</TIMEX> by his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in history. His rise to power
        ushered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hellenistic</ENAMEX> period.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenistic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Periods</ENAMEX>
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> went on to conquer lands as far to the east
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> became a crossroads for the long trading routes.
        Delos became one of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">marketplaces</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. Following
        Alexander‚Äôs death, his lands were divided among his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>. Much of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> came under the rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptolemies</ENAMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this famous ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX>.
        Although in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">88 b.c.</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mithradates</ENAMEX> made a swift and
        successful raid from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">East</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX>,
        the next major power change brought influence from the West. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hellenistic Empire</ENAMEX> was gradually, and peacefully, absorbed into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Empire</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> and the Coming of Christianity
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> ruled a pagan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> had an
        important influence on the early development of Christianity. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">a.d. ‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX> arrived on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patmos</ENAMEX>, a small rocky island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodecanese</ENAMEX>,
        as a political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX>. It was here that he wrote what was to become
        the final book of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Testament, the Book of Revelation</ENAMEX>. It wasn‚Äôt
        until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 330</TIMEX>, however, when the newly converted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">made Byzantium</ENAMEX>, renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX>, capital of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eastern Empire</ENAMEX>
        that Christianity was assured of its dominant role in future <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        life.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> had powerful and well-fortified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by
        waves of invaders. In an attempt to counter a threat from the Saracen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, a new potent religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> army
        forcefully enlisted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of the islands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disease</ENAMEX> took a further
        toll. By the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusades</ENAMEX>, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> islands had been
        practically depopulated.
        As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> weakened at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the first</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">millennium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> were sent from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> to counter
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and retake <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> faith.
        Unfortunately, their zeal was not matched by their discrimination. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">crusaders</ENAMEX> swept through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the l</TIMEX>;and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantium</ENAMEX> slaughtering <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>
        as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. Constantinople was
        taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1204</TIMEX>, and they stripped the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of manyof
        its finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">treasures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich</ENAMEX> now grace the public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Venice‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalthough</ENAMEX> a large consignment of books and manuscripts was
        transferred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patmos</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> fell.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">land</ENAMEX> was being divided, there was no one in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of the seas, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> raided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> on many of the islands. To
        counter this, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> moved from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> on the coast and
        built settlements inland, out of sight of the raiding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>. This
        created a pattern seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> of a small port
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">skala</NUMEX>) which serves an inland settlement or chora, making it easier to
        protect the island from attack.
        The minor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX> were taken by various powerful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noblemen</ENAMEX>, many of whom were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genoese</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venetian</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco</ENAMEX>
        Sanudo on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naxos</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noblemen</ENAMEX> had free rein to create their own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fiefdoms</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> fortified their main towns‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇNaxos Town</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiparos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX> are wonderful examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">this‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcreating labyrinths</ENAMEX> of
        narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> and cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sacs that were designed to confuse and to
        demoralize invaders. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoese</ENAMEX> took control of the eastern Aegean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX>, which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>.
        After a final bloody defeat by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1309</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> were forced from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights of St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, a holy military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, made their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhodes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kos</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodecanese</ENAMEX>. They began the process of building their strong citadels,
        and reinforcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> faith on the islands. However, they had
        not seen the last of their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> was gaining strength in
        the east to threaten their new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>.
        The Coming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Turks</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> were roving invaders who came from the east,
        taking land in what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 13th century</TIMEX>, they
        began their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> raids on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1453</TIMEX>, they took
        Constantinople, and immediately made it their capital, renaming it
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>.
        They then set their sights on the islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX> and, after an unsuccessful siege in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1480</TIMEX>, they finally ejected
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knights</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodecanese</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1522</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1566</TIMEX>, they wrested Chios
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoese</ENAMEX>, bolstering their hold on the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX>,
        but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclades</ENAMEX> remained in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> hands for another generation or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">more‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇTinos</ENAMEX> was the last to fall in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1715</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> brought new
        influences to the islands that they controlled, forming a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>
        that stretched around the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>.
        Toward <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> Independence
        However, a movement was growing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> peninsula
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> rule and for an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> came to aid the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> (defined by their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> religion
        rather than by historical geographical boundaries), declaring war on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> and occupying several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> islands until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1774</TIMEX>.
        Graffiti written by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> can be seen in the caves of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiparos</ENAMEX>.
        Although this attempt was unsuccessful, the campaign for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> state continued into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> and began to grow in
        strength. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX> played their part. Lesvos, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chios</ENAMEX>, and
        Samos lay in the important shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, and patriots began
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">disrupting Ottoman</ENAMEX> cargo traffic. In return, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> violently put
        down every insurrection, including the massacre on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chios</ENAMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were slaughtered.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> was weakening, however, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mainland achieved nationhood for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclades</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sporades</ENAMEX> island <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> were also included in this
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. A new sense of identity enveloped <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> throughout
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>, thus commencing a movement to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and unify the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">disparate Orthodox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century</ENAMEX>
        A series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX> began to sound a death knell for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> lost a short war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, and were forced to relinquish the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodecanese</ENAMEX> islands to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> took this opportunity to
        absorb the islands of the northern and eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean</ENAMEX> and to add
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX> to its mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX>.
        Following this debacle, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> then allied themselves
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, losing more territory with the defeat of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> in that war. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> was handed a strip of land along the
        western coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX>, which for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years</TIMEX> had had a
        substantial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> moved in to administer the land,
        but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part
        of greater <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> broke away from the tired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kemal Ataturk</ENAMEX> rose to power on a wave of popular support. He
        promised a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, but as the situation became
        volatile, civil strife broke out in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, and those
        considered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> of threats and violence. Many had to
        leave their birthplaces, fleeing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lesvos, Chios</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samos</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-ruled islands just offshore. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> arrived with
        little more than the clothes they wore, putting great strain on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> of the islands. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> was ousted from its new
        territory in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX>, which became part of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        state.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> attempted to stay out of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX>
        saw <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> as an ideal addition to his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> made
        a series of attacks from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodecanese</ENAMEX> islands,
        including sinking a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> in the harbor of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tinos Town</ENAMEX>, but
        they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population
        against them. Later the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> came in force and occupied many of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>.
        After the war, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodecanese</ENAMEX> islands finally
        became part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was politically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmented</ENAMEX>, with arguments between monarchists and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">republicans</ENAMEX>, right
        and left, and tension escalated into civil war. The struggle bypassed
        most of the islands, although there was fierce fighting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samos</ENAMEX>. Even
        after the fighting stopped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a decade later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was
        not stable.
        At the same time, the massive growth in air and road
        transport saw shipping decline in importance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX>, which
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> had been important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> on the trading routes, became
        the backwaters of this new transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and the economies of
        several islands came close to collapse.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> took the reins of power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>,
        and until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>, the ‚ÄúColonels‚Äù held sway with a repressive and brutal
        regime. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> chose to leave rather than live in poverty
        and terror, and many made new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>.
        The expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>
        along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean Islands</ENAMEX> became exciting destinations for northern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> escaping their damp, cool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Common Market</ENAMEX> (now the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>). Since this time, membership has been of great monetary
        benefit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> has given large subsidies to develop
        Greece‚Äôs infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monuments</ENAMEX>.
        Airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands,
        and road <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have been expanded and im proved. Private investment
        has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible.
        Politically, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> have been relatively quite times for
        the islands, although the divorce of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andreas</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> and his subsequent marriage to a much younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> caused
        consternation within conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> society.
        As the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> flared to war once again, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> nationalism
        has stirred, and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the
        land of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX> returning to the fold of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forefathers</ENAMEX>. Whether
        this will ever happen remains to be seen, but perhaps the aid offered
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1999‚</NUMEX>Äôs devastating earthquake is a sign that
        the animosity between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> is beginning to
        diminish.
