        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kowloon</ENAMEX> peninsula and the booming New
        Territories on the mainland call for some serious sightseeing; but we
        begin across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria Harbor</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> founded and which remains the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, business, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Central
        No matter how many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> and transit systems speed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-harbor traffic, nothing matches the ride on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Ferry</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowloon</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central District</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria Harbor</ENAMEX>. As the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">double-decker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> get ready to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>, bells ring, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gangplank</ENAMEX> is raised, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deckhands</ENAMEX> in blue sailor suits man the hawsers,
        and a couple of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> begin a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven-minute</TIMEX> sightseeing
        tour. The big green-and-white boat weaves its way through an
        ever-changing obstacle course of both large and small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>, and the
        soaring skyline of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX> draws <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearer</NUMEX>.
        As you get off, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardine House</ENAMEX> with
        porthole-shaped windows catches the eye. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and a
        Starbuck‚Äôs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX>, and you can access the raised pedestrian
        crosswalk from the escalators on the ground floor. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardine</ENAMEX>
        building is Exchange <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square</ENAMEX>, a complex with a large shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>; just
        behind it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Post Office</ENAMEX> with a philatelic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> on the
        ground floor.
        Farther west is the ferry terminal for the outlying islands.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught Road Central</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs curiosities,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">244</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">800-ft-</ENAMEX>) long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid</ENAMEX>-Levels outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">escalator</ENAMEX>. It ferries
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid</ENAMEX>-Levels apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> downhill from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> to
        10am, and uphill from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10am</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>. Nearby is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Market</ENAMEX>, the
        wholesale food market of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, and the Hang Seng <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> (private
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>).
        Just east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Ferry</ENAMEX> terminal, you‚Äôll come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>. No longer a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, it now functions as a cultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. Go through the underground walkway to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Statue Square</ENAMEX>; on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">east</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislative Council Building</ENAMEX>, one of the
        few colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> left in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. So great is the pressure on
        the available land that most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs colonial architectural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heritage</ENAMEX> has been demolished and replaced by new skyscrapers. Despite
        protests by preservationists, there was little alternative.
        Nearby is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chater Garden</ENAMEX> and a number of notable
        architectural landmarks. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX> is the striking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.M. Pei</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of China Tower</ENAMEX>, not beloved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇits
        triangular prisms and sharp angles violate the principles of feng shui
        (see box, page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>) and its radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">masts</ENAMEX> stick up like an insect‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antennae</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Bank</ENAMEX> is by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX>; built on a ‚Äúcoathanger frame,‚Äù its floors hang rather than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascend</ENAMEX>. From inside the vast atrium you can view the whole structure as
        well as the mechanical workings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bronze lions</ENAMEX>,
        carrying out feng shui principles, guard its doors.
        You can catch one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs historic trams along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Des</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voeux Road</ENAMEX> and ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Causeway Bay</ENAMEX> (see box, page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>). In
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904</TIMEX>, the narrow, double-decker <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trams</ENAMEX> ran along the waterfront, but
        land reclamation has placed them far inland.
        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of China Tower</ENAMEX>, make a short detour up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden</ENAMEX>
        Road and turn into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Battery Path</ENAMEX> to reach the landmark <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. John‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathe¬≠dral.</ENAMEX> Built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1847‚Äì1849</NUMEX>, this usually deserted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican</ENAMEX> foundation
        is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was
        turned into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>; it was restored after the
        war. Note the stained glass windows in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Quiet Chapel</ENAMEX>, designed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Edward Nuttgens</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX>. Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Building</ENAMEX>, now used as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Court of Final Appeal</ENAMEX>.
        Across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.M. Pei</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> a winding path leads up to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Park</ENAMEX>. The park‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10.5 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 acres</NUMEX>) of landscaped
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX> and lakes contains a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">greenhouse</ENAMEX> that holds many species
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>, and an aviary of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the Flagstaff
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Museum of Tea Ware</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>). It‚Äôs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest
        colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, with exhibits describing the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warring States</ENAMEX> period (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">475‚Äì221 b.c.</ENAMEX> ) to the present.
        If you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and walk up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Cotton Tree Drive</ENAMEX>, you
        will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peak Tram</ENAMEX> terminal.
        To the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summit</ENAMEX>
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a century</TIMEX>, the most exhilarating way up
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Peak</ENAMEX> has been by funicular. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peak Tram</ENAMEX> starts its scenic
        climb just across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and around the corner from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consulate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden Road</ENAMEX> and makes its way, sometimes at a startlingly
        steep incline, to the summit at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">398 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,305 ft</NUMEX>). The right-of-way
        travels past fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment blocks</ENAMEX>, bamboo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX>, and jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
        Passengers crane their necks for dizzying glimpses of the harbor. The
        Peak is still the most fashionable place to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, but real
        estate prices here are astronomical; rents run around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$50,000</NUMEX> a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peak Tram</ENAMEX>, originally steam-powered, was built to speed
        the wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taipans</ENAMEX> to their mountainside retreats. Before the tram was
        built, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX> chairs and rickshaws were the only way to get here. Since
        the tram‚Äôs inauguration in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX> it has stopped only for typhoons and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
        The modern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-passenger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> make the journey in around
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. However, on sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> you may have to
        brave a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> lining up at the lower terminal. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and
        autumn festivals, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> traditionally seek out the hilltops, the
        throngs are so large you would be better advised to try another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        At the upper terminus there is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-level shopping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peak Galleria</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Peak Tower</ENAMEX>, which resembles an
        airport control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> and has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, entertainment, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        You can walk around the peak for impressive views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kong</ENAMEX>, the coastline, and the islands in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lugard</ENAMEX> and
        Harlech <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. The view is especially effective at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. There are
        also souvenir stands, benches for a rest, and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs last
        surviving rickshaws‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhowever these are not for rides, but are a
        tourist photo opportunity. If you‚Äôre up to a climb, take the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria Peak Gardens</ENAMEX>. These gardens used to belong
        to the governor‚Äôs mountain lodge, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was demolished by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> during the occupation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
        From the lower terminal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peak Tram</ENAMEX> it‚Äôs only a short
        walk to the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">governor‚Äôs residence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government House</ENAMEX>, now a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX>. Across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoological and Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX>
        (gardens open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 6am‚Äì10pm</TIMEX>; zoo 6am‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì7pm</TIMEX>; admission free) provide a
        welcome <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">oasis</ENAMEX> amid the big-city pressures. In the very early <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is taken over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> doing tai-chi exercises. Both young
        and old go through ballet-like movements in slow motion to discipline
        the mind and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park‚Äôs zoo</ENAMEX> has a collection of weird and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wonderful chattering jungle birds</ENAMEX>.
        More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong Island Sights</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western District</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western District</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest
        neighborhoods, and its narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> hold a collection of fascinating
        traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX>. Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau Ferry Terminal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Market</ENAMEX> (open <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">10am‚Äì7pm</NUMEX>). It is more interesting
        for its architecture than for its shopping; it‚Äôs situated in a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Edwardian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX>. For an interesting glimpse
        of small and family-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, walk along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonham Strand East</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man Wa Lane</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cleverly Street</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">herb</ENAMEX> and medicine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, incense <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, chop makers‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> seals), and
        more.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong University‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> is spread along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bonham Road</ENAMEX>.
        When it opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> had a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. At
        the top of a sloping driveway, the stately <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Edwardian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> that was
        the original university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> presides over the institution‚Äôs newer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University‚Äôs Fung Ping Shan Museum</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonham Road</ENAMEX> (open
        Monday‚ÄìSaturday <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30am‚Äì6pm</TIMEX>, admission free) holds a significant
        collection of antiquities: bronzes, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> b.c. , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramics</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Dynasty</ENAMEX> tomb pottery. It also has the world‚Äôs
        largest collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestorian</ENAMEX> crosses from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuan Dynasty</ENAMEX>
        period.
        Around <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hollywood Road</ENAMEX>
        Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid-Levels Escalator</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, known for
        its antiques and curio shopping. Here the windows and open doors of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> reveal an alluring selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> furniture, carpets,
        carvings, tomb figures, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>.
        Walk west along <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hollywood Road</ENAMEX> until you come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Man Mo</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, the island‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of worship (though the date of its
        founding is subject to dispute). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> are
        confronted by a dense pall of smoke from all the burning joss sticks
        and the incense coils hanging from the ceiling (these will burn for as
        long as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>). The gold-plated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX> chairs on the left-hand side of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> were once used for transporting the statues of the temple‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods</ENAMEX> in religious processions. The statues in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> represent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Man</ENAMEX>, the god of literature, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo</ENAMEX>, the god of war, a curious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">juxtaposition</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is always crowded with worshipers.
        Just past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is the aptly named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ladder Street</ENAMEX>. Go
        down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> flight of steps to Lascar Row, popularly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cat Street</ENAMEX>,
        for more antiques and curio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. Walk up the steps to reach Caine

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tuesday‚ÄìSaturday 10am‚Äì5pm</ENAMEX>; admission by donation). The interesting
        Edwardian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pathological Institute</ENAMEX>, founded to
        combat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th</TIMEX> century‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-long</TIMEX> outbreak of bubonic plague. The

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacology</ENAMEX> and the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan Chai</ENAMEX>
        Just to the east of the financial district, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan Chai</ENAMEX> was
        once an area of sleazy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and topless bars; this was the setting for
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzy Wong</ENAMEX>. Servicemen relaxing from the rigors of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> poured <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan Chai</ENAMEX> boom of the
        1960s. There are still bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> here, but the area has become
        almost mainstream, and office towers are replacing many of the sinful
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">premises</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan Chai</ENAMEX> waterfront is dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Convention and Exhibition Centre</ENAMEX>, the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, which includes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, and exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">convention center</ENAMEX>, an
        extension on reclaimed land, affords stunning views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan Chai</ENAMEX>
        waterfront. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adjacent</ENAMEX>, just west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">convention center</ENAMEX>, is another

        Road.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wan Chai‚Äôs Bowen Road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maiden‚Äôs Rock</ENAMEX>, also called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lover‚Äôs Rock</ENAMEX>, is the gathering place for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Maiden‚Äôs festival</ENAMEX>.
        Although it is not a tourist attraction, the rock is steeped in
        tradition. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every August</TIMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> convene to light <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">joss</ENAMEX> sticks and
        some even climb the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nine-meter</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30-ft</NUMEX>) rock to pray for good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Causeway Bay</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About 2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan Chai</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Causeway Bay</ENAMEX> is
        second only to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsim Sha Tsui</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs place to shop. A prosperous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tourist</ENAMEX> district, it is full of shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>,
        along with a number of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">night-and-day</TIMEX> crowds
        make this area vibrant and lively.
        On the nautical side is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Causeway Bay</ENAMEX> typhoon shelter,
        where expensive yachts are anchored almost gunwale to gunwale, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yacht Club</ENAMEX> has its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. Across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gloucester Road</ENAMEX>,
        opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Centre</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noonday Gun</ENAMEX>, which under
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> rule was sounded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>. Silent for a time,
        the tradition has been revived and is a tourist attraction. It‚Äôs not
        clear how the custom started. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> story has it that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardine</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matheson & Co</ENAMEX> fired a private salute for a visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoon</ENAMEX>, an act
        that incensed the colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, who felt that they had the sole
        right to issue such a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>-gun welcome. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> were
        forced to limit their salvoes to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">day‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> from then on, they
        signaled the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> for all to hear. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> was made famous
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel Coward‚</ENAMEX>Äôs satirical <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">song, ‚ÄúMad Dogs and Englishmen</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        Farther east is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Park</ENAMEX>,
        with sports grounds and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. On the eastern side of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Victoria Park</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Causeway Road</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tin Hau Temple</ENAMEX>, dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tin Hau</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taoist</ENAMEX> Queen of Heaven and patroness of seafarers. Originally the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> was on the shore but reclamation projects have now left it high
        and dry. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 23rd day</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Third Moon</ENAMEX>, the birthday of the goddess
        is celebrated here and in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
        Inland from the bay is Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time it was a
        very miserable valley, a swampland conducive only to breeding malarial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>. It is home to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">racetrack</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> are so eager to play the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> that, despite the opening of a
        bigger and better <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">racetrack</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sha Tin</ENAMEX>, the Happy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Racecourse</ENAMEX> is
        thriving.
        Up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tai Hang Road</ENAMEX> behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Causeway Bay</ENAMEX> is Aw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boon Haw</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balm</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gardens</ENAMEX> (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30am‚Äì4pm</TIMEX>), founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX> by the late Aw
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boon Haw</ENAMEX>, who became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire</ENAMEX> by producing the medicinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balm</ENAMEX>. (It does not, in fact, contain any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredients</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX>, but
        does promise to cure a wide range of problems such as colds, headaches,
        rheumatism, gout, toothache, and scorpion bites. ) With its garish
        pagodas, artificial caves, and brightly painted statues of well-known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taoist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> legends, the garden is an obvious photo
        opportunity.
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen</ENAMEX>, the island‚Äôs oldest settlement, once a pirate
        lair, is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfloating population‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚</ENAMEX>Äî the boat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who spend
        their entire lives on the junks in the harbor, some proudly claiming
        never to have set foot on land (except for funerals, which don‚Äôt
        count). The junks are a picturesque sight: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> frolicking on the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">poop</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> preparing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or playing mah-jong, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> folk
        watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats underfoot</ENAMEX>, songbirds in bamboo cages
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overhead‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> all afloat.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> may appear deceptively primitive, but many of
        them have their own electric generators and all the modern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conveniences</ENAMEX>. There are fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> now than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX>; many boat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, especially the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX>, have moved to housing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>. You can take a tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in one of the small sampans,
        propelled by hand by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women drivers</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A half-hour</TIMEX> tour costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$50</NUMEX>; pay
        at the end, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> may cut your trip short.
        Aberdeen‚Äôs theatrical floating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> have been a
        tourist attraction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> may not live up to
        expectations, but the fantasy environment makes up for it. If you can
        get up early enough, you can attend the pre-dawn auction held at the
        vast local wholesale fish market; otherwise, have a look at the street
        market that goes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later in the day</TIMEX>.
        The peninsula opposite the east coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ap Lei Chau</ENAMEX> island
        contains <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ocean Park</ENAMEX> (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily 10am‚Äì6pm</TIMEX>; admission <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HK$75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>), which has become one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest
        attractions. It is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> areas: a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">highland</ENAMEX>, a lowland, and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX>. Linking the lowland and highland sections of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>, a cable-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> offers spectacular views across to the islands
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oceanarium</ENAMEX> is said to be the largest in the world, and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Theatre</ENAMEX> features displays by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">killer whales</ENAMEX>, seals,
        and pelicans. An enormous roller-coaster rising way above the sea,
        space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX>, and high-diving shows guarantee a day of excitement. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">recreated ‚Äúliving‚Äù</ENAMEX> history of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">China‚Äôs</ENAMEX> past,
        presented through a number of full-size replicas of shrines, temples,
        pagodas, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, and street scenes. There are also demonstrations of
        traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crafts</ENAMEX>, including silk-weaving, pottery, and p
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apermaking</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water World</ENAMEX>, formerly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, has closed for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redevelopment</ENAMEX>.
        Continuing around the coast in a counter-clockwise
        direction, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deep Water Bay</ENAMEX> offers a good beach and harbors. The next
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inlet</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Repulse Bay</ENAMEX>, a roomy, sandy crescent, with green hills. It‚Äôs
        so attractive and so easy to reach that it‚Äôs packed with sunbathers all
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer long</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> was once one of the main fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kong Island</ENAMEX>. The well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Mar¬≠ket</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>) is a major
        source for bargain clothing and other merchandise. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> is also a
        favorite place of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> for ex-pats. The waterfronts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repulse Bay</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley</ENAMEX> are lined with good caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        Kowloon
        Though much smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowloon</ENAMEX> has
        almost twice the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In many areas, the density reaches the
        equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150,000 inhabitants per square km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter square</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mile</ENAMEX>).
        Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowloon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs attractions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are centered
        near the tip of the peninsula in the district known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsim Sha Tsui</ENAMEX>.
        Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Ferry</ENAMEX> terminal is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean Terminal</ENAMEX>, where
        international cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> dock, and the gigantic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Harbour City</ENAMEX>, a
        complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        If you walk east on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Ferry</ENAMEX> terminal concourse, you
        will find yourself on the wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Promenade</ENAMEX>, which begins at the
        clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, all that remains of the once grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowloon-Canton Railway</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminus</ENAMEX>. The waterfront here offers unparalled views of the harbor and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX>. If you continue to the end of the promenade, you will
        be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tsim Sha Tsui East</ENAMEX>, a busy commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> built on more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 acres</NUMEX>) of reclaimed land.
        Flanked by the clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cultural Centre</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs major venue for the performing arts, the
        building has been criticized for its fortress-like architecture and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">windowless fa√ßade.</ENAMEX> The interior is a comfortable amalgam of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and
        Western design, with an impressive main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. The center contains a
        concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> with acclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">acoustics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, a library, an

        Next door is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong Space Museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Theatre</ENAMEX> (open
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wed¬≠nesday‚ÄìFriday 1‚Äì9pm; Sat¬≠ur¬≠day</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday 10am‚Äì9pm</TIMEX>; closed

        interactive exhibits, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in which you can experience
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">weightlessness</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater presents ‚Äúsky shows‚Äù</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAX</ENAMEX> films. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Art</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>) stands behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Museum</ENAMEX>
        next to the cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. It contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xubaizhi</ENAMEX> collection of
        painting and calligraphy; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> devoted to antiquities and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramics</ENAMEX>; and a gallery of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> art. Particularly interesting
        is the collection of paintings and photographs of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">museum</ENAMEX> mounts special exhibitions and has an excellent gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>.
        A few blocks up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatham Road South</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">museums</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scien¬≠ce Mus¬≠eum</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>) is a state-of-the-art
        interactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> that will teach you how everything and anything
        works from ancient sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> to the latest technology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> culture.
        Just across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salisbury Road</ENAMEX> from the cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">historic Peninsula Hotel</ENAMEX>, now expanded and modernized by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>-story
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>. Its restored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most elegant gathering place;
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> here is a visitors‚Äô ritual.
        Alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> runs busy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan Road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        fabled shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        Kowloon‚Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> was created by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Nathan</ENAMEX> when he was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the 19th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">At the time it</ENAMEX>
        was built, many thought it absurd to have a tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX>
        running through what was practically a wilderness. Now the former
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúNathan‚Äôs Folly‚</ENAMEX>Äù is known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúGolden Mile</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        A few blocks up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan Road</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kowloon Park</ENAMEX> (open daily
        6am‚Äìmidnight), elegantly laid out with fountains, promenades, and
        ornamental gardens; be sure to go up the steps to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sculpture</ENAMEX>
        Walk.
        Farther up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan</ENAMEX> Street you will reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yau Ma Tei</ENAMEX>, one of
        the older parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowloon</ENAMEX>. Turn off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan</ENAMEX> and walk down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kansu Street</ENAMEX>
        to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jade Market</ENAMEX> (open 10am‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì3pm</TIMEX>; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>), with more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> spread out in a large tent, just before you reach the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overpass</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs liveliest market scene is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple Street</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Night Market</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>), near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordan Road</ENAMEX>. Everything is sold here,
        from clothing to souvenirs to electronic goods, and the market is known
        for its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-side food <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>, where you can dine inexpensively on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX>. The market runs all the way up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tin Hau Temple</ENAMEX>, where you
        will find fortune tellers‚Äô tables (some speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>) and possibly
        street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> singing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> opera or pop songs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is one
        of the many dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tin Hau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of seafarers; this one also
        houses an altar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shing Wong</ENAMEX>, the city‚Äôs god. In the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> (open <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">8am‚Äì6pm</NUMEX>) attracts worshipers, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> attracts
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strollers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mah-jong players</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan Road</ENAMEX> goes all the way up to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boundary Street</ENAMEX>, which

        Boundary Street, off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Street West</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuen Po Street</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird Garden</ENAMEX> (open <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">8am‚Äì7pm</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Birds</ENAMEX> are favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>,
        valued for their singing rather than their plumage, and here you‚Äôll
        find all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> for sale as well as elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">teak</ENAMEX> and bamboo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cages</ENAMEX>.
        Off the beaten path in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sham Shui Po</ENAMEX>, west of the junction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan Road</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boundary Street</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tonkin Road</ENAMEX> (open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monday‚ÄìWednesday</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friday‚</ENAMEX>ÄìSaturday
        10am‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì6pm</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday 1‚Äì6pm</TIMEX>; closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>). This ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial vault</ENAMEX> is
        believed to date back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Han Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 25‚Äì220</ENAMEX>). The
        barrel-vaulted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> were discovered while excavating for a nearby
        housing project.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Territories</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚Äôs New Territories</ENAMEX> begin at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boundary Street</ENAMEX>.
        Surprises spring up on all sides: new industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> alongside
        sleepy farming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper towns blooming</ENAMEX> in the middle of
        nowhere, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hakka</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in their traditional flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX> hats with hanging
        black curtains, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water buffalo</ENAMEX>, and flashes of azalea everywhere.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Territories</ENAMEX> can be explored by taking the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway</ENAMEX> (KCR), which makes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> stops between the station
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kowloon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheung Shui</ENAMEX>, the last stop before entering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Ask
        the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> about its interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX> Tour from Kowloon
        and other countryside tours (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>).
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> makes a circuit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Territories</ENAMEX>,
        beginning with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsuen Wan</ENAMEX>, situated in an area of heavy
        industry just west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowloon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, a commanding view
        over all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Territories</ENAMEX> to the north can be seen from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai Mo Shan</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest peak at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">957 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,140 ft</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> continues
        parallel to the coast. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One-third</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beaches are to be
        found in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single 14-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-mile</NUMEX>) stretch of this region‚Äôs shoreline.
        Place names are often based on the distance to the nearest mile-post,
        as measured from the tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kowloon</ENAMEX> peninsula. Thus you will find
        ‚<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Äú191/2-mile</NUMEX> Beach‚Äù at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Peak Bay</ENAMEX>.
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> continues clockwise around the New
        Territories. As you approach the border, you can glimpse the
        skyscrapers of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX>. The lookout point at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lok Ma Chau</ENAMEX> was once
        known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Kong‚Äôs ‚Äúwindow</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">China‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        isolation from the West, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> would come to the lookout point here
        and rent binoculars in order to get a glimpse of the great mystery
        beyond.
        Set amid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tseun Wan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX>
        walled village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Tung Uk</ENAMEX>, now preserved as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and a short
        walk from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. Not far away, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">milepost 21</NUMEX> near the large
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuen Mun</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taoist</ENAMEX> retreat known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ching Chung Koon</ENAMEX>.
        This ‚ÄúTemple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Pines‚</ENAMEX>Äù is a spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> containing temples
        and pavilions, statues, and gardens. It is known for its collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bonsai</ENAMEX> and houses a jade seal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>. Among the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ponds</ENAMEX> is one inhabited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visitors</ENAMEX> toss in coins in the hope
        of bouncing one off a turtle‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, a sure way of achieving good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortune</ENAMEX>.
        An even more interesting image out of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> history is
        the walled village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kat Hing Wai</ENAMEX>, in the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kam Tin</ENAMEX> just
        outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuen Long</ENAMEX>. This is the most easily
        accessible of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Territories‚</ENAMEX>Äô walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. It is built in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">square</ENAMEX>, and the only way in is through the gate in the brick defensive
        wall. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kat Hing Wai</ENAMEX> was built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four or five centuries ago</TIMEX> by the Hakka
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX>, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Clans</ENAMEX> that migrated here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>). Many of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> have been
        replaced by modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tang</ENAMEX> clan‚Äôs earliest walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lo Wai</ENAMEX>, which
        also has its defensive wall intact and is entered by a narrow gate.
        Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is the restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall</ENAMEX>.
        Few traditional ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> remain in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> since the
        anti-historical destruction during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX>, so these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Territories</ENAMEX> ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> are rare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>. Another such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>,
        belonging to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu Clan</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu Man Shek Tong</ENAMEX> in the village of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheung Shui</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most interesting sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Territories</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tai Fu Tai</ENAMEX>, another rare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX>, this one a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> that belonged to
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Confucian</ENAMEX> high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1865</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> who achieved the rank of tai fu (mandarin) by doing well
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Exam¬≠inations.</ENAMEX> The preservation of this wonderful home
        is ongoing; a projected restoration of the original garden is still in
        progress. The traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Qing</ENAMEX> Dyna¬≠sty style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> is
        enlivened by a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">West¬≠ern touches</ENAMEX>: a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baroque</ENAMEX>-style ceiling and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">stained</ENAMEX> glass above the doorways, showing the builder‚Äôs up-to-date
        attitude at the time of construction.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> and the railway stay close together from
        Fanling, site of the best golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> in the area. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tai Po</ENAMEX>, just south
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanling</ENAMEX>, is known for its market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tai Po Market</ENAMEX>, which buzzes with
        activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7am</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6pm</TIMEX>. Just up a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> from the market is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Man Mo Temple</ENAMEX>, with long-burning incense coils hanging from its
        ceiling, a popular spot dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taoist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX> of war and
        literature.
        The railway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> then curves gracefully around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tolo Harbor</ENAMEX>,
        an idyllic body of water well-protected from the open sea. You can take
        a ferryboat through the harbor, past the ingenious Plover Cove
        reservoir, a water catchment area appropriated by damming and draining
        a broad inlet from the sea. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> go on to the friendly fishermen‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">island of Tap Mun</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mirs Bay</ENAMEX>, with stops in remote hamlets of the Sai
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kung Peninsula</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sai Kung</ENAMEX> area is the location of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> official parks
        and nature preserves, while on the south side of the peninsula are some
        of the territory‚Äôs best beaches.
        From the next railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is visible. Teaching here is conducted
        in both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art Gallery</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Studies Building</ENAMEX> is worth a visit for its painting and
        calligraphy collections.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sha Tin</ENAMEX> is the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monastery</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddhas</ENAMEX>,
        which looks down on a burgeoning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of</NUMEX> stone
        steps in the hillside to walk up before you reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Man Fat Temple</ENAMEX> with
        its regiments of small gilt statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> lining the walls. Some
        indefatigable climbers will want to go up to the top of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-story
        pink pagoda for a panoramic view. There is a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>
        statues here, plus the remains of the monastery‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> embalmed in
        gold leaf. Also here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Heritage Museum</ENAMEX> (call <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2180</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8188</TIMEX> for open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has an art collection, and displays of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toys</ENAMEX> and other artifacts.
        Down to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sha Tin Racecourse</ENAMEX> can accommodate over
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectators</ENAMEX> and is equipped with every imaginable luxury,
        including a giant video screen facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX>, and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>,
        air-conditioned stables. Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sha Tin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Town</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Plaza</ENAMEX> features <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, cinemas, and even a computer-controlled musical
        fountain.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock formations</ENAMEX> are always pointed out on
        excursions. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sha Tin Rock</ENAMEX>, better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amah Rock</ENAMEX>, is actually a pile
        of several rocks that resemble a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> in a sling on her
        back. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that a local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> climbed the hill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> to
        watch for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> returning from across the sea; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
        and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> were turned to stone as a permanent symbol of her
        enduring faith. Closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion Rock</ENAMEX>, shaped like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX> lying
        in wait. It really looks the part; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> know its name even
        before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> can translate it.
        The Islands
        Excursion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> sell a variety of orientation cruises
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> that include a look at some of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX> outlying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>. These pleasant, but expensive, outings can lay the foundation
        for your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explorations</ENAMEX> aboard the cheap but usually comfortable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ferries</ENAMEX> used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> themselves. From the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX> you can escape to islands without <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> or cares, where
        the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> smile ‚Äúhello‚Äù and, if you‚Äôre lucky, point you to a
        secret beach for the ultimate in quality leisure time. For ferry

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lantau Island</ENAMEX>
        The mountainous island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lantau</ENAMEX> is the biggest in the
        colony, and covers nearly twice the area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong Island</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chek Lap</ENAMEX>
        Kok airport sits on reclaimed land just off Lantau; plans to build a
        bridge may change <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lantau</ENAMEX>, but at present it is sparsely populated and
        makes a perfect getaway.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">934 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,064 ft</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lantau Peak</ENAMEX> is high enough to attract
        the occasional rain cloud‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇrefreshingly cool breezes blow on most hot
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer days</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is parkland, and there is a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70-km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45-mile</NUMEX>) circular hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX>). Ferries depart
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours between 6:10am and 10:30pm</TIMEX> to Silvermine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mui Wo</ENAMEX>), where a bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> to all parts of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>. There are also ferries to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery Bay</ENAMEX>.
        A short bus ride away is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cheung Sha Beach</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, and popular for its white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>.
        The most famous site on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is the world‚Äôs tallest
        seated bronze statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">22 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">72.6 ft</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiantan Buddha</ENAMEX>
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>). The statue and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are on a peak, up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">268</NUMEX>
        steps, above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Po Lin Monastery</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> is strictly vegetarian,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are warned not to bring any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> with them. You can have a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious vegetarian</ENAMEX> lunch here.
        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> enjoy the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> cross-country
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trek</ENAMEX> down to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silvermine Bay</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have warned walkers to
        be on the lookout for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, which can be plentiful in the Lantau
        hinterland, especially in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. The hillsides that surround the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monastery</ENAMEX> are the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are

        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trappist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, situated on a hillside overlooking

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> from the southwest end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery Bay</ENAMEX>; the walk takes about
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>.
        Cheung Chau
        Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> lies this small,
        crowded island, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only one square mile</NUMEX> in size. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 25,000</NUMEX> people
        live here, mostly by fishing, but there are also ex-pats, attracted by
        its laid-back <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> ambience. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has a checkered past
        of smuggling and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pira cy</ENAMEX>. That era is gone now, but other elements of
        the island‚Äôs old life are preserved. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still carve jade and
        build seaworthy junks, all by hand. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Fish</ENAMEX> (heads discreetly wrapped in
        paper) are still hung out to dry in the sun.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheung Chau</ENAMEX> becomes the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> life once a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, usually in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bun Festival</ENAMEX>, a folklore extravaganza
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>). The rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, life goes on at its accustomed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pace</ENAMEX>: rickety machines chugging in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-man <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in
        school uniforms being ferried home to houseboats, and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>
        stirring shrimp paste.
        By way of formal tourist attractions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pak Tai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, built
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1783</TIMEX>, has some fine carvings and a great iron sword said to be 600
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>. But the most interesting thing to do here is to explore the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> on the island, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheung Chau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Wai</ENAMEX>. They are an easy
        walk apart by the harbor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, or a longer <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX> hike on the scenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peak Road</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Praya</ENAMEX>, the promenade in front of the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX>, is a
        good place to observe the many junks and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> in the harbor.
        There are also several open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> where you can enjoy fresh
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamma Island</ENAMEX>
        Only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 minutes</TIMEX> by ferry from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lamma Island</ENAMEX> is
        perfect for swimming, hiking, picnicking, birdwatching, or just sitting
        back to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> grow. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 12,000</NUMEX>; it is still largely undeveloped, and
        life on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamma</ENAMEX>, if not totally primitive, is close to the essentials.
        Archaeologists indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamma</ENAMEX> has probably been inhabited for some
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4,000 years</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúHong Kong‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age Island</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Äù
        The principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yung Shue Wan</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamma‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwest</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sok Kwu Wan</ENAMEX>, on the east coast. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> offer good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waterfront</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> with homestyle <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, principally seafood
        fresh from the tank. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> are within hiking distance of several
        beautiful beaches, and within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a one-hour</TIMEX> hike of each other on a marked
        trail. You can build an appetite for dinner by making your way from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yung Shue Wan</ENAMEX> is still a very British
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residential</ENAMEX> enclave, with many nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX>.
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excursion</ENAMEX> to Macau
        Macau, the final bastion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">empire</ENAMEX>, is much more than just a quirk of history. Here, where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and
        West <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> met, life combines the spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> with something of the
        sunny atmosphere of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>.
        Macau‚Äôs historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, with its colonial architecture,
        has a distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Medit¬≠er¬≠ranean</ENAMEX> flavor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Col¬≠¬≠o¬≠n¬≠na¬≠¬≠ded</ENAMEX> public
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>, winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">flagstoned</NUMEX> squares and the
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> all speak of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> inheritance as well as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, a fusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> that has produced the unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macanese</ENAMEX> culture.
        The story of the Western discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> begins in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1513</TIMEX>
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">explorer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge Alvares</ENAMEX>, reached the south coast of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Traders</ENAMEX> followed in his wake, setting up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in several parts
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">estuary</ENAMEX>. Finally, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1557</TIMEX>, they were all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consolidated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX>. It was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> gateway to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> flowed Western technology and religion. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1576</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory XIII</ENAMEX> created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau diocese</ENAMEX>, covering all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
        No less impressive were the secular challenges. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> were not on speaking terms, so trade between them had to be
        channeled through a neutral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">middleman</ENAMEX>. Lucky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> fit the
        specifications exactly. Portugal‚Äôs resulting near-monopoly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East‚</ENAMEX>ÄìWest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> understandably awakened the competitive instincts of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> powers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> sent an invasion flotilla to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1622</TIMEX>,
        but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> triumphed. However, the end of the golden age was
        drawing near. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> began to relax trade restrictions, and with the
        rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macau</ENAMEX> became an isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outpost</ENAMEX>.
        A haven for persecuted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese Christians</ENAMEX> in the 17th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century, Portugal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs neutrality during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> assured the
        territory a flood of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX>. They were joined by a swarm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX> of
        all conceivable nationalities, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> won a name for international
        intrigue.
        Portugal‚Äôs very precarious foothold on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> coast
        ended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> with a formal handover to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Macau, now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Zone of Zhuhai</ENAMEX>, is becoming something like a boomtown
        as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exporter</ENAMEX> of toys, furniture, and electronics. New construction in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10 years</TIMEX> has changed the city‚Äôs skyline; with new, glittering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and highrise apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is beginning to look a
        little more like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
        Macau‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 450,000</NUMEX>, an
        appallingly high figure for such a small area; recent land reclamation
        has eased the situation to some extent. If a trace of tropical lethargy
        still adds to the charm in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk caf√©s</ENAMEX>, palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and
        pedicabs, any torpor definitely ends once inside the doors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, scene of some of the liveliest gambling west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>.
        Gambling provides <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 40 percent</NUMEX> of the government‚Äôs tax revenues,
        and is a major source of employment. Its spin-off industries,
        prostitution and pawn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, also thrive.
        Arriving
        The easiest way to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> is by jetfoil, operated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TurboJet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2859-3333</TIMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40-mile</NUMEX> trip takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX>.
        Departures are from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau Ferry Terminal</ENAMEX>, just west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shun Tak Centre</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught Road</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jetfoils</ENAMEX> leave <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every 15 to 30 minutes 24 hours a day</TIMEX>.
        Entry procedures are similar to those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmost
        nationalities need only a passport to enter Macau. Macau‚Äôs own
        currency, the pataca, is pegged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> dollar, and you can
        use your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> currency freely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX>.
        Upon arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX>, be sure to stop by the Macau
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Tourist Office</ENAMEX> for a map, brochures, and directions. Outside
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX>, you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> to all points (take
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 3A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10A</NUMEX> to the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>; exact change is required).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also be approached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pedicab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>; these are tricycles
        carrying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>. Pedicabs were once the most common form of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> they are mainly a tourist
        attraction.
        Sights in Macau
        Directly across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from the wharf where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>
        arrive from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is the first surprise to greet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jai</ENAMEX>-alai <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX>, said to be the world‚Äôs most luxurious

        are imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> to take part in this lightning-fast Basque ball
        game.
        The grandstand situated on the seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, the Avenida
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Amizade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Friendship Avenue</ENAMEX>), marks the finishing line for the Macau
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Prix</ENAMEX>, the international car-racing event held here every
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. Also in front of the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> is a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cyber</ENAMEX> fountain,
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX> water spouts that shoot up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">230 ft</ENAMEX>) and are illuminated
        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</NUMEX> spotlights producing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> colors.
        Continuing around the peninsula in a clockwise direction
        brings you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Praia Grande</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Beach Street)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> pleasant
        promenade with shaded benches under the banyan <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Along this
        elegant avenue is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government House</ENAMEX>, a modest pink <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>.
        The central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city center</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Largo</ENAMEX> do
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senado</ENAMEX>. For an authentic feel of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, slip into the cool
        entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of theimpressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Leal Senado (‚ÄúLoyal Senate‚Äù</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>), a
        fine example of colonial architecture. On the inside walls are flowered
        blue tiles (azulejos) and coats of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. The inscription over the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archway</ENAMEX> reads, ‚ÄúCidade do nome <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Deus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">n√£o ha outra mais leal‚Äù (‚</ENAMEX>ÄúCity
        of the Name of God, None is More <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Loyal‚Äù)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇa bit of praise attributed
        to Portugal‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John IV</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. For all its historic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandeur</ENAMEX>, the loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> now is the equivalent of a city council, its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statesmanship</ENAMEX> dedicated to water supplies, sewage lines, and the
        establishment of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>.
        Macau‚Äôs most memorable monument is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Baroque fa√ßade</ENAMEX> of
        the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S√£o Paulo</ENAMEX>, the only remains of a beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. On top of a hill in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs
        approached by a grand staircase. The rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and an
        adjoining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> were destroyed in a typhoon-fanned fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1835</TIMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> sculptural effects on the fa√ßade mix <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and Western symbols:
        familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dragons</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> caravel. Beneath the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Sacred Art</ENAMEX> houses a collection of sacramental
        objects.
        The ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Macau</ENAMEX> (open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuesday‚</ENAMEX>ÄìSunday

        overview of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history and its daily life and traditions. A
        re-created <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> is lined with traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1524‚Äì1580</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> national

        may have stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX>. Local legend claims that he wrote part of his
        great saga, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Os Lus√≠adas</ENAMEX>, in what is now called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cam√µes Grotto</ENAMEX>,
        situated in the spacious tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cam√µes Garden</ENAMEX>.
        Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, behind a gate (opened to anyone who
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knocks</ENAMEX>), is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Protestant Cemetery</ENAMEX>. Those whose fate was to die on
        some far foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> could not have wanted a more peaceful, lovely

        built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
        For a different vision of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old China</ENAMEX>, spend a few quiet
        moments in the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lou Lim Ieoc Garden</ENAMEX>. Here, arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>,
        pagodas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> ponds, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> of bamboo create the mood of a timeless

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>. Photos and documents tell the life

        8am‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Äì6pm</ENAMEX>), is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of considerable splendor
        and charm. Surrounded by statues, carvings, and incense <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">burners</ENAMEX>, here
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> make their devotions and check their fortunes, and
        traditional funerary displays give a cheerful send-off to the recently
        departed.
        An unexpected piece of historical memorabilia turns up in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> garden, where guides point out a small stone table used
        for a treaty-signing ceremony in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1844</TIMEX>. The signatories, who were the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viceroy</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> plenipotentiary of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States of America</ENAMEX>, put their names to a historic document‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe
        first-ever treaty between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        Another important ceremony took place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> when Macau
        became part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Handover Pavilion</ENAMEX> was meant to be a temporary
        structure, but public outcry ensured its preservation (located on Xian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xing Hai</ENAMEX>; open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays 10am‚Äì6pm</TIMEX>, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10pm weekends</TIMEX>). Nearby is the

        traces the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau‚Äôs</ENAMEX> connection to the sea. Exhibits cover
        fishing, seaborne trade, sea transport, and there is an aquarium. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> also offers boat tours aboard a fishing junk.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is almost on the spot where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> landed. When they came ashore they found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A-Ma Temple</ENAMEX>
        (properly called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma Kok Temple</ENAMEX>; open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn to dusk</TIMEX>), dedicated to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite goddess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, who is also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tin Hau</ENAMEX>. The
        area was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-Ma Gau (‚ÄúBay of A-Ma‚Äù</ENAMEX>), and in this way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macau</ENAMEX> got
        its name. The ornate, picturesque temple dates from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1368‚Äì1644</ENAMEX>) and is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX>.
        The remains of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barra Fortress</ENAMEX>, which once
        defended the southern tip of the peninsula, contains the chapel of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. James</ENAMEX>). The saint is much revered in the surrounding
        area. Among other legends surrounding the statue is a very modern one:
        During the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Chinese Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Guards</ENAMEX> were running
        rampant on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wanchai</ENAMEX> island, just a swim away, the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. James</ENAMEX> is
        said to have stepped down from the altar and halted an invasion. Part
        of the fortress has been converted and is now used as a luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">inn</ENAMEX>. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">northernmost</NUMEX> point in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau</ENAMEX> is the frontier between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contrasting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worlds</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Barrier Gate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portas do Cerco</ENAMEX>), which was built more than a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century ago</TIMEX>, marks the boundary between the enclave of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">People‚Äôs Republic of China</ENAMEX>.
        Trying Your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luck</ENAMEX>
        Macau‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> are a source of non-stop excitement. There
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of them; you can‚Äôt miss the eye-popping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisboa</ENAMEX>, which has
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of gambling, but there‚Äôs also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyatt Regency</ENAMEX>, the
        Mandarian <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taipa‚Äôs Jockey Club</ENAMEX>. The fancifully decorated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau Palace</ENAMEX>, a floating casino moored on the western waterfront, is
        fitted out with gambling tables, slot machines (known locally as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúhungry tigers‚Äù</ENAMEX>) and, for hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>. Gambling is
        wildly popular with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, and they make up nearly
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> offer familiar international games‚<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbaccarat,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blackjack</ENAMEX>, boule, craps, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">roulette‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalong</ENAMEX> with more exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pastimes</ENAMEX>. Watch the fantan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> and you‚Äôll almost
        be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>: It‚Äôs simply a matter of how many odd buttons are left
        after he has divided a pile of them into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>.
        Dai-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small</ENAMEX>) is a dice game in which the
        croupier throws <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dice inside a glass container. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Players</ENAMEX> bet on the
        numbers that will come up, and on whether the result will be ‚Äúbig‚Äù or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúsmall.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Keno</ENAMEX> is a variation of bingo in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">player</ENAMEX> chooses
        numbers to bet on before the draw is made.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> have no admission charge and formal dress is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">optional</ENAMEX>, though long pants for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are required. They keep busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours a day</TIMEX>, but if you want a change of scene there are always more
        gambling opportunities available. You can try your luck at pari mutuel
        betting on jai-alai at pari mutuel, greyhound-racing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cani¬</ENAMEX>≠drome
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the largest in the world), and harness-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">racing</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taipa</ENAMEX>.
        Shopping in Macau
        Like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> is a duty-free port. It is famous
        for its gold jewelry. Market prices per tael (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">34 grams/1.2 ounces</NUMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> are set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. You should always ask for a certificate of
        guarantee when you buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> or jewelry. Look for jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> along
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida do Infante D. Henrique</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida de Almei¬≠da Ribeiro</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Browsing</ENAMEX> is a real pleasure in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and
        byways, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> aimed at the tourist market are interspersed with
        the more workaday ironmongers, herbalists, and noodle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>.
        Knowle¬≠dgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> look for antiques‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeither Chinese</ENAMEX> heirlooms or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leftovers</ENAMEX> from the gracious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> colonial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. However, you are
        not likely to find bargains, and you should be aware that unless you
        are an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>, you can end up with a fake. Also worth investigating are
        contemporary handicrafts, both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, from across the
        border.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Food</ENAMEX> and Drink
        Gourmets award <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macau</ENAMEX> high marks for dependable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        cooking with an exotic bonus: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> food and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. Macau‚Äôs own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cuisine</ENAMEX> is a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> flavors with the flavors imported
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. Whether you choose to dine in one of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, or international-style
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, you will be treated to a hearty meal at a good price.
        The ingredients, especially the fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and seafood,
        are first-rate. A delicate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">delicious fish</ENAMEX> is Macau sole (linguado).
        Imported dried cod (bacalhao) is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>; several
        varieties are available, usually baked.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macau</ENAMEX> has an ample supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. Try a vinho
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">verde</ENAMEX>, a mildly sparkling young <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> from northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, or a
        hearty red <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D√£o</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colares</ENAMEX>. After dinner, a glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is
        recommended to round off the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>. The more abstemious can stick to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taipa</ENAMEX> and Coloane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridges link Macau</ENAMEX> with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands. Since the
        construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Macau-Taipa Bridge</ENAMEX> has allowed easy access to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has grown to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 30,000</NUMEX>, with
        industrial development, new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment blocks</ENAMEX>, and luxury resort
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>.
        The quaint <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipa Village</ENAMEX>, with its narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> and
        colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> painted yellow, blue, and green, has almost been
        completely swallowed up by the development of nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing projects</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is also the designated home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Asia</ENAMEX>.
        Pay a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa Museu da Taipa</ENAMEX>, and you‚Äôll be able to get a
        glimpse of how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> lived in former <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. A grand colonial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>, fully restored and outfitted with period furnishings, provides
        the centerpiece for this expanding ‚Äúcultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        Farther away is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coloane</ENAMEX>, connected to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipa</ENAMEX> by a causeway
        and a large land reclamation project. Not as developed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taipa</ENAMEX>, it
        offers the joys of sand and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> and is known for its beaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheoc Van</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hac Sa (‚ÄúBlack Sands‚Äù</ENAMEX>) are both popular resort areas, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lifeguards</ENAMEX> on duty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and windsurfing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> for rent. There are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, and changing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coloane</ENAMEX> is picturesque, with a central square lined with caf√©s. The
        waterfront drive parallels the shore of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>
        headed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> pass through the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX>. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis Xavier</ENAMEX> is dedicated to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>, and has on display the elbow of the saint, along with the
        bones of numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyrs</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seac Pai Van Park</ENAMEX>, on the west coast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is an
        interesting natural preserve with aNatural History <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>.
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excursion</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs major seaport for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000 years</TIMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> still
        maintains its important gateway role. Ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canton Trade</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> (officially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese Export Commodities Fair</ENAMEX>) has attracted
        throngs of international business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 5 million</NUMEX>,
        straddles the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl River‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Äî‚ÄÇChina‚Äôs fifth longest‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich</ENAMEX> links the
        city to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">waterway</ENAMEX> accounts for much of the
        local charm and excitement, as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> drama of the ferryboats,
        junks, sampans, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">freighters‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> even small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tankers</ENAMEX> and big
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gunboats‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇunfolds right in the center of town. The river also
        irrigates the carefully tended surrounding farmlands, creating a
        beautifully lush, subtropical scene. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guangdong Province</ENAMEX> has some of
        China‚Äôs most fertile land, and grows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crops of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, along
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> of all kinds.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> today is mostly about business and industry,
        featuring new development, skyscrapers, a whole new business area, and
        raised expressways. The scary traffic is a real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">experience‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇvehicles
        of all kinds jockey for position on crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, missing each other
        by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inches</NUMEX>, and speeding on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeways</ENAMEX> is rampant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> is
        interestingly one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most prosperous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, determinedly on
        the move into the modern world. It seems that the picturesque older
        sections with their old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, and winding alleyways
        may not be around much longer.
        Arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>
        There are many package tours to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">113</NUMEX>), and this may be the easiest way to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        However, it‚Äôs also easy to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> or ferry. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
        comfortable express trains depart the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kowloon-Canton Railway</ENAMEX> (KCR)
        Station in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hung Hom, Kowloon</ENAMEX>, making the trip in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than two hours</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Turbo Cat</ENAMEX> ferries leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China Hong Kong City</ENAMEX> (CHKC) terminal twice
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>; the journey takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibus</ENAMEX> also travels to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHKC</ENAMEX>; there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> round-trips a day, taking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31/2 hours</TIMEX>.
        You will need a visa to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> for
        information). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> currency is widely accepted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>, or
        you can change your currency into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yuan</NUMEX>) at any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>.
        Note, however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> does not go the other way (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, is primarily
        Cantonese-speaking, but many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> also speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is
        spoken in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and tourist destinations.
        If you travel by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, you will arrive at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East Station</ENAMEX>, a large modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, which connects with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, hotel transfer services, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX>. The train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is in the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, with sweeping blue tile roofs, contains an auditorium
        big enough to seat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. It was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX> with
        contributions from overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>. The center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Five</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rams Statue</ENAMEX>. It celebrates the founding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> spirits
        rode their goats down from the celestial realm to present the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with their very first <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>.
        Guangzhou‚Äôs most important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> monument is the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,400-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banyan Trees</ENAMEX> (open <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">8am‚Äì5pm</NUMEX>). Although
        the banyan <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that once flourished here are now no more, the
        often-restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has remained a focus of local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Buddha</ENAMEX> statues in several of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs aspects adorn
        the temples, and overlooking them is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flower Pagoda</ENAMEX>, a
        slender relic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Song dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 960‚Äì1279</ENAMEX>).
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early Middle Ages</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX> had a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as a result of its trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. This explains
        the presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou of the Huaisheng Mosque</ENAMEX>, reputed to be
        China‚Äôs oldest, and traditionally dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 627</TIMEX>. Rebuilt in modern
        times, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> serves the small local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>. The
        modern minaret is known as the ‚ÄúPlain (or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naked) Pagoda</ENAMEX>,‚Äù in contrast
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Flower Pagoda</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Jia Ci</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chen Family Institute</ENAMEX> (open daily
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30am‚Äì5pm</TIMEX>), was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19th century</TIMEX> to promote arts and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crafts</ENAMEX>. An architectural wonder, it is itself a beautiful piece of
        craftsmanship with its sculpture and carved stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balustrades</ENAMEX>.
        Porcelain friezes adorn the rooftops and ridgepoles, telling the story
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</ENAMEX>. Inside is a collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramics</ENAMEX>, carvings, and furniture. There is also a market and a
        porcelain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>.
        A former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Confucian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is presently the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">historic National Peasant Movement Institute</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> trained its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Zedong</ENAMEX> himself
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institute</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>, and gave lectures on geography, rural

        taught here.
        The atmosphere of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX> is best evoked on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shamian Island</ENAMEX>, a haunting, nostalgic place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl River</ENAMEX>. This
        small formerly residential island, beautifully shaded by banyan <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
        was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the closed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> in the era
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúconcessions</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> were barred by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> with iron gates to
        keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> out. Its stately <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> have since
        been restored, largely for use as government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and foreign
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">legations</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> also has Guangzhou‚Äôs first modern luxury resort
        hotel.
        A popular optional excursion is an hour‚Äôs detour to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guangzhou Zoo</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>. It houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal species</ENAMEX>,
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX> of which is the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">panda</ENAMEX>, and has an imaginative monkey

        Not to be missed is a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous open-air
        market, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qing Ping</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> is famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cantonese</ENAMEX> love
        to eat and have the reputation of eating almost anything that walks on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> legs. The market bears this out: Along with the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX>, you will see for sale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, bats, and sometimes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">monkeys‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇall</ENAMEX> are highly prized as delicacies. More pleasantly, you can

        A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Side Trip to Foshan</ENAMEX>
        A very popular day-trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foshan</ENAMEX>, a

        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years</TIMEX>. The individual artisans‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are no longer
        here, but you can visit a silk-weaving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plant</ENAMEX>, and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lanterns</ENAMEX>, carving sculptures, painting scrolls, and cutting
        intricate designs in paper. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Foshan Art Porcelain Factory</ENAMEX> has
        traditional designs, but also some attractive modern pieces.
        Foshan‚Äôs most outstanding artistic monument is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zu Miao</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taoist Ancestral</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sung</ENAMEX> dynasty establishment rebuilt in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> and well worth visiting. Constructed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, brick,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX>, ceramic, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>, this is a work of extravagant beauty,
        uniting many ancient art forms. The complex contains the oldest wooden
        stage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wan Fu Tai Chinese opera</ENAMEX>.

        Because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shenzhen</ENAMEX> is much cheaper than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, it is a
