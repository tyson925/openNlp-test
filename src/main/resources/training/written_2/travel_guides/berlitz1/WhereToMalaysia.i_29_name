        Setting your priorities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> before you start out is
        essential to making your trip both pleasant and satisfying. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Happily,</ENAMEX>
        many destinations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> offer a key activity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> will be
        searching for, such as exploring <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> culture and history or
        engaging in a sport like fishing, but often there is an added bonus: a
        nearby jungle for trekking or a beachside resort‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand this is true
        throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        Malaysia‚Äôs well developed transportation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">infrastructure‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇboth road</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">air‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalso</ENAMEX> offers the chance to step
        away from rigid planning if you desire to stay an extra day by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX> or want to do some more extensive shopping. Caution is needed if
        you are not used to a hot and humid climate (a constant but not
        necessarily hostile factor), and often requires a little extra planning
        when heading out on tour, trekking, or just lazing by the pool.
        At the back of the book, our helpful A to Z section provides
        detailed practical information on how to handle your stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>.
        Here we provide some general touring strategies before describing the
        places you will be visiting.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touring Strategies</ENAMEX>
        Starting in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> hold a mirror to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaysia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ethnic blend of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eurasians</ENAMEX>, living side by side or in their
        separate neighborhoods. This takes on a metropolitan dimension in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lumpur</ENAMEX>. (In true <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> style, we will refer to the capital by its
        abbreviation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX>. ) The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northeast</ENAMEX> coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, especially between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kota Bharu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuantan</ENAMEX>, is one of the best places to see traditional
        Malay life with its rich <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> culture, particularly evident in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kampungs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>) of the interior. Step back into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> history
        in the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kota Kinabalu</ENAMEX>, where colonial rivals
        once battled for supremacy, and where princes and sultans dealt in
        palace intrigue. You will also be caught by the beauty of the many
        mosques, temples, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> as the country‚Äôs faithful
        practice their beliefs, their places of homage often existing within
        steps of each other in harmony. But remember when visiting places of
        worship to dress in an appropriately dignified manner and to slip off
        your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> before entering a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melaka</ENAMEX>,
        observe the way of life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babas</ENAMEX>, the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, and
        its more modern manifestation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Penang‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇor indeed elsewhere, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chinatowns</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> offer chances to explore, browse, or
        buy.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, while being few in number, provide an excellent
        chance to gain insight into the path the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has taken, as well as
        offering a sense of the country‚Äôs culture and folklore. The major ones
        are in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melaka</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kota Kinabalu</ENAMEX>. And the picture
        of life on the peninsula is best completed with a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, if you happen to be passing through.
        Heading Out to the Country
        Beyond city limits you will find myriad opportunities to
        enjoy the rural and forested <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>. But finding your way around the
        riches of rainforest, coral reef, or marine reserve can be bewildering
        if you plunge in unprepared. Unless you already have some experience in
        the region, we recommend that you use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of the many
        first-class local tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>. For jungle tours, they provide
        experienced English-speaking guides, most of them with a good knowledge
        of the rainforest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Offices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Development</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporation</ENAMEX> in your home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> can provide guidance to the most
        reputable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>). Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> have their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX> and organize tours nationwide. They may sub-contract
        to smaller but equally reliable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in outlying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> has done a fine job of giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> access to
        its natural treasures without ‚Äútaming‚Äù them too much. At the heart of
        the peninsula, the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taman Negara</ENAMEX> gives you the most comprehensive
        view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">country‚Äôs animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in their wild <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. A more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúcompact‚Äù</ENAMEX> approach is possible on the islands, notably with excursions
        into the wilderness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tioman</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi</ENAMEX>. If you are attracted by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>-laying habits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rantau Abang</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>.
        On the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borneo</ENAMEX>, the great natural attractions are
        Sarawak‚Äôs caves at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulu</ENAMEX>, river cruises with a visit to tribal
        longhouses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabah‚Äôs</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Kinabalu</ENAMEX> and the offshore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sepilok wildlife sanctuary</ENAMEX>. If your desire is to
        escape the coastal heat, highland retreats will refresh and invigorate,
        offering a chance to enjoy what was once the exclusive domain of
        colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX>.
        And Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beach</ENAMEX>
        White sandy beaches and gentle sea breezes are for many the
        perfect recipe for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a holiday</TIMEX> from the stresses of modern life, and in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> the offerings are plenty. Whether on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peninsula</ENAMEX> or at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarawak</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find many opportunities to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bask</ENAMEX> and laze under the tropical sun. (Just remember to use
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sunscreen‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsunburn</ENAMEX> and possible dehydration are never too far away.
        )
        On the west coast the best beaches are at the island
        resorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unspoiled</ENAMEX> stretches of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> can
        also be found on the east coast, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantai Chinta Berahi</ENAMEX>, north of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kota Bharu</ENAMEX>, down to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beserah</ENAMEX>, north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuantan</ENAMEX>. Farther south are the
        resorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tioman Island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desaru</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Malaysia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuching</ENAMEX> and Kota
        Kinabalu both have fine hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
        Speaking the Language
        Though the official tongue is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahasa Malaysia</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is still the common language of communication between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>. After an initial nationalist resistance to using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> to accompany <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> road signs, a new effort is being made to
        accommodate foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>. But you may still like to use a few words
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> as a courteous gesture to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>.
        You will find a comprehensive list of useful phrases in the
        back of this book.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>
        Malaysia‚Äôs prosperity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX> is most evident in
        the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the peninsula, where the signs abound. From the
        new international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dramatic skyline to the middle class
        seen driving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX>-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Proton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedans</ENAMEX> on six-lane highways‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇall
        are evidence to the country‚Äôs rising economic maturity. But even as a
        new light rail system wends its way through the capital, progress has
        not entirely buried <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> under chrome and concrete. Still thriving
        are the old commercial areas which brought so much of the wealth to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> generally.
        Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">past‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhose structures</ENAMEX> now
        more often stand in the shadow of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL‚</ENAMEX>Äôs new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skyscrapers‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcontinues</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">echo</ENAMEX> amid the northern hill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>. Here amid the cool afternoon
        breezes or gentle mountain mists of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron Highlands</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">English</ENAMEX>
        palate for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> (on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation scale‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> still thrive.
        Those retreats within easier reach of the city‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genting Highlands</ENAMEX> or theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> born out of former tin mines‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdraw
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> entertainment, a far cry from the more
        traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, zoos, and aquariums.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> and industry line the way to the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of
        Klang on the coast, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ipoh</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perak</ENAMEX> state‚Äôs most flourishing tin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Kangsar</ENAMEX> is the leisurely, royal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX>. The vast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taman Negara</ENAMEX>, which translates as ‚Äúnational <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>,‚Äù is one of the best
        preserved primary rainforests in the world, at once accessible to the
        public and lovingly protective of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>
        At times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuala Lumpur‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇoften</ENAMEX> referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KL‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇappears
        to be a criss-cross of pedestrian-unfriendly overpasses and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expressways</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> opens to islands of almost jungle-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-cover before descending again into lively market centers
        surrounded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that look down upon the city‚Äôs busy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> may initially be drawn to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petronas Twin</ENAMEX>
        Towers or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL Communications Tower</ENAMEX>, which are potent symbols of
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>. But the more fascinating splendors of the past are
        closer to street level, where distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> styles are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beautifully</ENAMEX> preserved.
        As in other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is
        predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is prominent in the modern
        business world. Chinatown itself remains a hive of bustling activity,
        standing cheek by jowl with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little India</ENAMEX> of pungent spice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">ornate Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnic Malays</ENAMEX> are present in the upper echelons
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, civil service, and tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historic Center</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main historic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> lies near <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX>
        Hishamuddin, where on the east side of the broad avenue is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Abdul Samad Building</ENAMEX>. The handsome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">crypto</NUMEX>-Moorish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Secretariat</ENAMEX>,
        now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX> (finished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>) and capped
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> onion-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> tops a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40-m</NUMEX>- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120-ft-</ENAMEX>) high
        clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> that suggests inspiration from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Ben</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. That is
        perhaps not a surprise, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">architect A. C. Norman</ENAMEX>. At the other end of this building you‚Äôll also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">find Infokraf</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handicraft Development Corporation</ENAMEX>
        has a permanent exhibition of national craftwork, with many exhibits
        for sale. Near this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lebuh</ENAMEX> Pasar
        Besar, which now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textile Museum</ENAMEX>.
        Among the many impressive skyscrapers, one of the most
        striking is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dayabumi Complex</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>), southeast of Dataran
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merdeka</ENAMEX>. The soaring white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> successfully integrates traditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Islamic architectural themes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpointed arches</ENAMEX>, delicate open
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tracery‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwith</ENAMEX> its otherwise modern design. Included in the
        southernmost end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">adjoining</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pejabat Besar</ENAMEX> Pos
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Post Office</ENAMEX>), in a similar <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> modern style, and a
        shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>.
        On the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dataran</ENAMEX> Merdeka
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom Square</ENAMEX>). In the colonial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the sound of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> bat‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">willow</ENAMEX> would have been heard as the afternoon‚Äôs sun-rays stretched
        across the field. It was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the mock-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tudor Royal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selangor Club</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX>), also designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. C. Norman</ENAMEX>, took time off from
        the affairs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> to play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX>. On the wide span of lawn the
        cheers of independence were heard on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 August 1957</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> now
        hosts National Day state parades. On the square‚Äôs northern side, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglican St. Mary‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX> dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1893</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. C. Norman</ENAMEX> was rivaled in commissions by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. B. Hubback</ENAMEX>,
        whose work is reflected in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Railway buildings</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, located south on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hishamuddin</ENAMEX>. The main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX> (completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX> and extensively renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>) resembles
        nothing so much as a gleaming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sultan‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX> and is more attractive
        than the somber brown headquarters <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. It is a
        fine example of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> architecture, reflecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mogul</ENAMEX>
        glory of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th and 14th centuries</TIMEX>. The north <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> was bombed in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> was gutted by fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>.
        Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbock</ENAMEX> also designed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masjid Jamek</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</TIMEX> this
        building has marked the confluence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gombak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klang Rivers</ENAMEX>,
        where tin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> loaded supplies to be sent upriver and unloaded their
        tin for shipment west to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Klang</ENAMEX>, and where the city‚Äôs roots were

        Chinatown
        Away from the expressways and southeast from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apothecaries</ENAMEX> who display their herbs and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> in porcelain jars to

        At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Petaling</ENAMEX> is closed to traffic, the
        area comes alive, giving way to peddlers selling watches (bewildering
        replicas of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> brands), music and video cassettes, clothing,
        jewelry, and ornaments. The side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are full of open-air

        Past the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Tun H. S. Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Cheng Lock</ENAMEX> junction
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">See Yeoh Temple</ENAMEX>, founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yap Ay Koy</ENAMEX>, a city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL‚</ENAMEX>Äôs

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the breathtaking displays of color comes soon after
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwoong Siew Association Temple</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sri Mahamariamman Hindu</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Bandar</ENAMEX>, on the west side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinatown</ENAMEX>. It was built in

        known officially as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuala Lumpur City Centre</ENAMEX> (KLCC), will be
        disappointed to find that there is no public access to the upper
        stories. It is possible to retreat into the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> next door for
        up-market fashions and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>. For the best views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> try the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damansara</ENAMEX> south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Gardens</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>,
        blends modern and traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> design. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> glass mosaic murals

        exhibits of sculptures and textiles from within the region. Given the
        extent of wealth it has brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, it is not surprising to
        have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Rubber Museum</ENAMEX>, which opened since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubber</ENAMEX>

        Set on a hill at the northern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> across a main

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Poets Cave</ENAMEX>, where verses of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tamil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thiruvalluvar</ENAMEX>
        are painted on stone tablets. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-line kural verses deal
        variously with morals, wisdom, love, and finances.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templer Park</ENAMEX>
        Farther north (another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 km/6 miles</NUMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ipoh Road</ENAMEX>)
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batu Caves</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Templer Park</ENAMEX>, which offers the sights of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> rainforest for those with little time to venture into the
        major national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and forested areas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX>, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Templer</ENAMEX>, conceived the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äúvast</ENAMEX> jungle
        retreat for the public‚Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>. Covering an area of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,200 hectares</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 acres</NUMEX>), the rainforest comes complete with waterfalls, rushing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streams</ENAMEX>, lagoons for swimming, and caves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bukit Takum</ENAMEX> limestone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cliffs</ENAMEX> to explore. There are several clearly defined paths, with the

        The Highlands
        By the time <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> came under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> imperial sway,
        colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had fully developed the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, where they could cool off from the hot and humid lowlands
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before air-conditioning. These <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">havens</ENAMEX> of relaxation set
        among golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, gardens, and orchards still do the mountain ranges
        of the peninsula‚Äôs interior, but they are now holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are lured to the highlands closest to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kuala Lumpur‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇThe Genting</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Fraser‚Äôs Hill‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇwhile the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlands</ENAMEX> is most popular region for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. These retreats
        offer everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> to horseback riding, golf to jungle
        trekking, depending on the location. The jungles, especially in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron Highlands</ENAMEX>, were once the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strongholds</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> during the
        Emergency, so some caution is required when venturing into undeveloped
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>; good maps are a must, and on occasions a guide would be
        recommended.
        Genting Highlands
        Nearest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">highland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort areas</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>

        cry from the peaceful, misty, forested mountains they were just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades ago</TIMEX>. Now, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> and hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is variously described
        as simply noisy to a ‚Äúone-stop destination for fantasy, excitement, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adventure‚Äù</ENAMEX>; your conclusion obviously depends on your point of view.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> here, from an 18-hole golf
        course to a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with cinemas, a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">monorail</ENAMEX>, boat-rides, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">restaurants‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeven</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32-</NUMEX>lane <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-pin bowling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The resort‚Äôs

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser‚Äôs Hill</ENAMEX>
        In contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genting Highlands</ENAMEX>, this charming,
        old-fashioned hill <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX>,
        is built across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hills, its highest point being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,921 ft</NUMEX>)
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Titiwangsa</ENAMEX> mountain range. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX> it offers a retreat for
        Malaysia‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> set. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> was named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis James Fraser</ENAMEX>,
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> adventurer and scoundrel, who dealt in mule hides, tin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opium</ENAMEX>, and gambling. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> disappeared mysteriously before the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> came into being, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>.
        Road access may be difficult, with the last <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>)
        along a winding, narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX> where an alternating, one-way traffic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> is in place. It was along this portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, where you‚Äôll now
        see a sign <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúEmergency Historical Site</ENAMEX>,‚Äù that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British High Commissioner</ENAMEX>
        Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gurney</ENAMEX> was killed during the height of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insurgency</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>.
        The countryside is wilder and less cultivated than that in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron Highlands</ENAMEX>, but the sedate side of colonial life is also
        more recognizable here in the white-and-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grey stone bungalows</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX>, rhododendrons, poinsettias, hollyhocks, and dahlias in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a range of accommodation on offer, from the Jalai
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Resort</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puncak Inn</ENAMEX> in the top tier to more middle-range <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>,
        bungalows, and even a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> hostel. There are good tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>, and even horseback
        riding.
        Several nature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> are also marked out through the
        nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, and the wealth of wildlife makes jungle rambles
        particularly enjoyable. A swim is possible at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeriau Waterfall</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">41‚ÅÑ2 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) north of town. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birdwatchers</ENAMEX> look out for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 270</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> which may be seen in the immediate area. Each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nature Society</ENAMEX> supports an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúinternational bird</ENAMEX> race,‚Äù

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron Highlands</ENAMEX>
        The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest</TIMEX> of the cool hill resorts, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">240 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 miles</NUMEX>)
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX>, stands on a splendid plateau of rolling green valleys
        surrounded by the rugged granite peaks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Titiwangsa Range</ENAMEX>, the
        tallest of which is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Brinchang</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,032</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,664 ft</NUMEX>). If you‚Äôve
        been traveling on the coast, or elsewhere in semi-tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron Highlands</ENAMEX>, located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 1,520 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,987 ft</NUMEX>) above sea
        level, offer great relief amid morning mists and cool breezes.
        Spread over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">townships</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ringlet</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanah Rata‚ÄÇ (‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brinchang</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ringlet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX>, the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> point of arrival, offers little that is special, apart from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flower nurseries</ENAMEX> and access to some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>. Thirteen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kilometers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) farther brings you to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanah Rata</ENAMEX>, the main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">township</ENAMEX>. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ringlet</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Bakar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>, an
        artificial lake formed by the damming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bertam River</ENAMEX>. Brinchang, a
        few <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more kilometers</NUMEX> beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanah Rata</ENAMEX>, is better known for its
        vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>, and of course, the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> was named after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cameron</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        surveyor, who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1885</TIMEX> reported the finding of the ‚Äúfine plateau. ‚Äù His
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù</ENAMEX> was soon followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea planters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> vegetable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">growers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlands</ENAMEX> also still hold the answer to the mysterious
        disappearance of wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American Thai</ENAMEX>-silk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Thompson</ENAMEX>,
        who disappeared on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX> after going off for stroll while
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX> at the hill <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highlands</ENAMEX> are best reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KL‚ÄìButterworth</ENAMEX> line to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tapah Road</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and then by taxi up into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hills</ENAMEX>. Driving yourself on the narrow winding road with frequent
        back-ups imposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> in a hurry could be a hazardous business.
        Let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> worry about that, while you admire the magnificent
        scenery changing from lowland mangrove, bamboo, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, to denser
        rainforest of lush greenery and, as the heat drops away to the more
        comfortable mountain air, montane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> and laurels familiar to
        temperate climates.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanah Rata</ENAMEX> is festooned with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, good <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tearooms</ENAMEX> serving the
        local Cameronian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brew</ENAMEX> together with cakes and servings of locally grown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Stores</ENAMEX> offer everything from the practical to
        glass-mounted scorpions and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX>.
        A visit to a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> is easily arranged, with bus
        service readily available to and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>
        are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boh Tea Estate</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungai Palas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Blue Valley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">estates</ENAMEX>. Accommodation options in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanah Rata</ENAMEX> vary depending on your
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>, with the upper tier offering international-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strawberry Park</ENAMEX>, to the moderately priced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cameronian Holiday Inn</ENAMEX>.
        Worth a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">visit‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeven</ENAMEX> if you can‚Äôt afford the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> rates‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis Ye</ENAMEX> Olde
        Smokehouse near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>. The ivy-covered, mock-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tudor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> has
        become something of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> since it was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. An
        afternoon traditional ‚Äúcream tea‚Äù or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> roast lunch or dinner is
        an experience in itself. Nearby is a fine 18-hole public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beautifully</ENAMEX> kept despite the strange hazard of a narrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX>-sided
        canal running across the middle of it.
        The cooler climate makes jungle walks here a special
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pleasure</ENAMEX>, not least of all for the myriad brightly colored butterflies
        around the waterfalls, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a dozen</NUMEX> officially listed. Several
        of the walks pass <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">through‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇor close to‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rata</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most clearly marked paths from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanah Rata</ENAMEX>, easiest
        for the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, lead within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> to a refreshing swim at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parit</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls or Robinson Falls</ENAMEX>. Other, more challenging choices, for which you
        should enlist the help of a guide, take you up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Perdah</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,576</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m/5</ENAMEX>,169 ft), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Jasar</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,696 m/5,562 ft</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Beremban</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,841</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m/6</ENAMEX>,040 ft). Besides the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX>, look out for red-bellied
        squirrels, wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>, and, if you are lucky, an occasional tapir. The
        local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butterfly Farm</ENAMEX> is probably your best chance of seeing the grand

        Perak
        A journey to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perak</ENAMEX> takes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> into what once was
        the key region for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> economic prosperity, standing as a lure
        to powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and interests as well as (mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>) migrant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tin</ENAMEX>, the basis for the state‚Äôs wealth, was once taken from
        diggings that claimed to be the largest such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> in the world. The
        wealth from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mines</ENAMEX> paid for many of the historical structures
        evident through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Perak, which means ‚Äúsilver‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>, is
        Malaysia‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, reaching from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanjung Malim</ENAMEX> in the

        Its sultan‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is also the last to be able to trace its ancestry
        to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ipoh</ENAMEX> may be considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taiping</ENAMEX> (formerly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Larut</ENAMEX>), in this role in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1937</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ipoh</ENAMEX> is now
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuala Kangsar</ENAMEX> is the royal

        The journey north from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX> either by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> takes you

        massive onion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of glowing copper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> in a nest of white. Begun in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, its construction was interrupted on several occasions, most

        Another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 minutes‚Äô</NUMEX> drive from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Kangsar</ENAMEX>, this old

        ‚Äúeverlasting peace,‚Äù was proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> as part of its diplomatic
        contribution to the end of the bloody feuds between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> secret
        societies fighting over control of the tin-mining industry in the
        1870s. They were forced to end their conflict under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pangor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> intervention.
        Happily boasting the peninsula‚Äôs heaviest rainfalls,
        Taiping, the former capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, is now a sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> full

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>. On the way, you will pass the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>, used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> and then for guerrilla <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> captured during the

        Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Gardens</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taiping War Cemetery</ENAMEX> bears
        impressive witness to the peninsula‚Äôs early role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific War</ENAMEX>
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>. The tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Australian Air</ENAMEX>

        pretty bungalows and rest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> offer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> for rent, with balconies
        overlooking the valley, but booking in advance is necessary. The walk
        to the summit is signposted, and upon reaching the top on a clear day
        it is possible to view the sweep of the coastline from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> to

        Pulau Pangkor
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the few locations on the west coast to offer

        a regular holiday retreat, offering swimming and other activities as

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south of Taiping</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pangkor Island</ENAMEX> takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 45 minutes</TIMEX>. Once there,

        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kelantan</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Backpackers</ENAMEX> may want to go it alone, but most are advised
        to plan their visit through a tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX> or before they leave
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>. Armed with an entry permit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> make <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> for the

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> ride on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tembeling River</ENAMEX> is likely to be one
        of the highlights of your visit. Along the way, you will see aboriginal

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park authorities‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsetting</ENAMEX> or checking their nets. Keep a look out,
        too, for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> buffalo taking a soak, river-lizards slipping in and out
        of the water and looking as large as crocodiles (the latter do not come
        this far upstream), and even an occasional otter. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, you
        will see the flash of a kingfisher or hornbill. Wear a hat and bring
        along plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral water</ENAMEX>. The journey usually takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX>,
        even longer when short stretches of the river dry up, forcing

        There are marked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> leading from the park‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> into the jungle. Guides use them for organized walking and
        boat tours, but you can, of course, go off in your own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. There are

        With patience and luck by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> or rotating shift watches by
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, you may see wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>, sambars, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">barking deer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gibbons</ENAMEX>,
        pig-tailed macaques and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">leaf monkeys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree shrews</ENAMEX>, and red flying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">squirrels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumbang Hide</ENAMEX> have seen rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leopards</ENAMEX>.
        During the fruit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">birdwatchers</ENAMEX> have spotted up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> just around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park headquarters</ENAMEX>. Among them: lesser fish

        warblers, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> paradise flycatchers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Siberian</ENAMEX> blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">robins</ENAMEX>.
        Even if you do not spot much of the wildlife we
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mention‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand you are almost assured of seeing something‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe sheer
        experience of the jungle at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, with its incredible noises, the
        flitting of mysterious fireflies, and the sense of invisible but
        omnipresent life and movement around you make it all worthwhile.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX>
        For the romantics, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX> names of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Dickson</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX> (formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malacca</ENAMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> evoke stories of the
        glorious past of sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> junks carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>,
        silks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, of cutlasses, noble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, and beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">princesses</ENAMEX>. In
        many ways this is the story of southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs southwest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coastline</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, the rich tapestry of history lies in the monuments

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> colonizers. In the far north,
        Pulau <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> is both holiday destination and commercial center, while
        closer to the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulau Langkawi</ENAMEX> is the newest resort
        destination for those in search of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> and gentle seas.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX> to Melaka
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selangor</ENAMEX> leads through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Negeri Sembilan</ENAMEX>, literally the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúnine states‚Äù federated</ENAMEX> as one in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX>. You travel past the vast palm oil and rubber plantations
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seremban</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX>.
        Sereban
        Here the architecturally distinctive Minangkabau
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">buffalo</ENAMEX>-horn roofs of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sumatran</ENAMEX> heritage are evident, together with the
        more recent colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> style and the traditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        commercial shophouses. The main attractions are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Legislative</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly Building</ENAMEX>, a nest of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> roofs, one for each founding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taman Seni Budaya Negeri</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arts and Culture Complex</ENAMEX>). Visit the
        state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and in the grounds opposite is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kampung Ampang Tinggi</ENAMEX>,
        built entirely of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> prince‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. On show in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> are weapons as well as brass and silverware and a tableau
        portraying a grand royal wedding. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neo-Classical State Library</ENAMEX>, with
        its imposing colonial fa√ßade, was once the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">State Secretarial Building</ENAMEX>.
        Opposite is the extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Gardens</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sri Menanti</ENAMEX>
        For what is probably the best original example of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minangkabau</ENAMEX> architecture, take a side trip to the old royal capital, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seremban</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuala Pilah Road</ENAMEX>. The ruler‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace, Istana Lama</ENAMEX>, was the official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the royal family
        until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>, replacing an earlier palace which had burnt down. The
        palace features <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> pillars, denoting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> of various luak

        Melaka
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malacca</ENAMEX>), easily reached by air or express bus
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX>, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaysia‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, built on the trading empires of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> and textiles and a history soaked in the blood of battles as
        rival colonial powers challenged each other to take hold of the port.
        In its glorious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> heyday, it had been the most vital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> docked as the city‚Äôs
        sultans expanded their territorial reach from the wealth of trade to as
        far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pahang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> and even to the east coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sumatra</ENAMEX>.
        Today, even as the high-rise makes its present felt, the colonial past
        remains in the architecture and monuments. The city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinatown</ENAMEX> and
        especially along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jalan Hang Jebat‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇonce</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jonker Street‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇare
        havens for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antiques buyers</ENAMEX> or those who just want to browse along the
        street‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shophouses</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Historic Center</ENAMEX>
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of historical or cultural significance
        are all within easy walking distance of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch Square</ENAMEX>,
        down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Melaka River</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is situated just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Melaka Bridge</ENAMEX>. Spanning
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> was once the town‚Äôs main strategic link between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">port</ENAMEX> and city and the site of major battles against the European
        invaders.
        The most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch Stadthuys</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>), dating from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1650</TIMEX>. It was originally
        the official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>. Behind
        the red fa√ßade is a structure of masonry hauled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has housed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Ethnography</ENAMEX>
        and History, tracing the town‚Äôs colonial and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> past.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jam Besar</ENAMEX> (clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>) was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX> by the
        family of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Bee Sweng</ENAMEX>. In the middle of the square
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Victoria Jubilee Fountain</ENAMEX>, flanked by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>-deer
        recalling the legendary little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beast</ENAMEX> that inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parameswara</ENAMEX>
        to make Melaka his capital.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christ Church</ENAMEX>, with its imposing red exterior, was erected
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1741 and 1763</TIMEX>, in commemoration of the centenary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>
        occupation. Additions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> were made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteenth century</TIMEX>. Each of the long ceiling beams of its interior is
        hewn from one <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Equally impressive are the original massive,
        hand-made wooden pews.
        The archway and gate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A Formosa</ENAMEX> fortress, the
        remains of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> fort next to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stadthuys</ENAMEX>, is all
        that stands, saved from total destruction by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stamford Raffles</ENAMEX>, then
        a government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX>. The date <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1670</TIMEX> and coat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> were
        added to the gateway by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch East India Company</ENAMEX>. The gate steps
        lead to the remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul‚Äôs Church</ENAMEX>, built by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> sailor,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duarte Coelho</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1521</TIMEX> and origi nally known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Church of Our Lady</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annunciation</ENAMEX>. It was later renamed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>. In front of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Statue</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis Xavier</ENAMEX>, its right arm broken
        off during a storm. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> Jesuit missionary visited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melaka</ENAMEX>
        several times from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1545</TIMEX> until his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1553</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shangchuan Island</ENAMEX>
        off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canton</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, a stone slab marks his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>,
        empty since his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> were transported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goa</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. Granite
        tombstones from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> era stand against the walls. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> is to be found farther down the hill.
        Set among its own grounds is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tugu</ENAMEX> Pengistiharn
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kemerdekaan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Proclamation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Independence Memorial</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>. It
        occupies what was once known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malacca Club</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> colonials
        and local planters. It was on the club‚Äôs padang (playing field) that
        future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tunku Abdul Rahman</ENAMEX> announced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</TIMEX> the success
        of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> negotiations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Memorial building</ENAMEX> offers
        films and documents tracing the campaign for independence. Opposite on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Padang Pahlawan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bandar Hill</ENAMEX>) a sound-and-light show is held in the
        evenings, following the tradition of turning history into entertainment
        to draw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>.
        Back to the river, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs more recent additions,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritime Museum</ENAMEX>, is housed in a model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flor De La Mar</ENAMEX>, a

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istana Kesultanan Melayu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Malay Sultanate Palace</ENAMEX>)
        stands as a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> amid elegant gardens north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porta da</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santiago</ENAMEX>. Reconstructed from ancient prints, it is an approximate but
        noteworthy replica of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mansur Shah‚</ENAMEX>Äôs grandiose hilltop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, which
        is believed to have burned down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1460</TIMEX>.
        Chinatown
        The living history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX> is to be found among the Baba

        The narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka‚Äôs Chinatown</ENAMEX>, just next to the
        river, hold an abundance of history, especially of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last century</TIMEX>, when
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneurs</ENAMEX> from this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> helped lift the local economy.
        Their contribution now stands among the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> along <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Tun Tan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Lock</ENAMEX>, also known as ‚ÄúMillionaire‚Äôs Row. ‚Äù This is an

        able to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sri Pogyatha Vinayagar Moorthi</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1781</TIMEX>), dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant god Ganesh</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinayagar</ENAMEX>, is
        also one of the oldest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>; it dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1781</TIMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kampung Pantai</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mausoleum of Hang Jebat</ENAMEX>, who was killed unjustly

        Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Center</ENAMEX>
        Rather than drive around the sights away from the old city
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, you may prefer to relax and let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trishaw-driver</ENAMEX> find the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> give you the bonus of his wry comments. Start perhaps with an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evening</ENAMEX> ride along the open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Taman</ENAMEX>, better
        known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Glutton‚Äôs Corner</ENAMEX>. Until the recent land reclamation for new
        housing developments, these <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tamil Indian</ENAMEX> eating
        places bordered on the seafront, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX> (the most notable dish
        being the spicy mee hoon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX>) has not changed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bukit China</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX>, the hillside provides a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> for over
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,000 graves</NUMEX>, mostly horseshoe-shaped tombs. At the top of the hill
        you will see foundations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese Franciscan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monastery</ENAMEX> and get a splendid view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX> Straits.
        The gaudy red, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sam Po Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> stands at the foot of
        Bukit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng Ho</ENAMEX>, the eunuch admiral who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1409</TIMEX> opened
        up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> trade. Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perigi Raja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sultan‚Äôs Well</ENAMEX>)
        dug in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hang Li Po</ENAMEX>, whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> had given as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mansur Shah</ENAMEX>. Its pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> were
        subsequently protected by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> fortifications.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portuguese Settlement</ENAMEX>
        A short drive some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> center
        along <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Parameswara</ENAMEX> takes you to the heart of this little Eurasian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>, peopled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX>. Around
        Jalan d‚ÄôAlbuquerque and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dataran Portugis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portuguese Square</ENAMEX>), the
        houses look no different from those in the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX>, but you may
        hear snatches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cristao</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> dialect, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> calling out to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúAfonso,‚Äù ‚ÄúLuis,‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúFilomena. ‚Äù The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> on and off the square serve good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX>, though over the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centuries the Portuguese</ENAMEX> cuisine has taken on a spicy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> flavor. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community worships</ENAMEX> at the simple, unassuming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs Catholic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> is an especially big event attracting many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> to the great candlelit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">procession</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Roads</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swimmers</ENAMEX> should beware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> at the beaches,
        but it is worth taking a ride north along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jalan Tengkera</ENAMEX> coast road
        to visit some of the picturesque fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. On the way, take a
        look at the fine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-tiered, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumatra-style Kling Tengkera Mosque</ENAMEX>. It
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial place</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Husain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johor</ENAMEX>, who negotiated with
        Raffles the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>. You will find good crab and
        shrimp at the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantai Kundor</ENAMEX>. Farther north, Tanjung
        Bidara, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Melaka</ENAMEX>, has a hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> and some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pleasant tree</ENAMEX>-shade on the beach for picnics.
        Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX>, you can take a boat
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umbai</ENAMEX> out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulau Besar</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has good white sandy beaches
        and offers some pleasant walks in the jungle. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> has recently
        been opened on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulau Besar</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Penang</ENAMEX>
        Located on the northeast coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulau Pinang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Betel Nut</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX> is the draw to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, with rich colonial and

        busy thoroughfares add to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> history
        reflected in the shophouses and older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Entry points to the
        island are by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and rail, a ferry journey across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Selat</ENAMEX> Selatan
        from the industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butterworth</ENAMEX>, or by way of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7-km</TIMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">41‚ÅÑ2-mile</NUMEX>) drive over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Penang Bridge</ENAMEX>, which provides wonderful

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> are available.
        Though most of the activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs
        also possible to relax at a beach-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side resort</ENAMEX> or to flee the heat on
        the railway link to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang Hill</ENAMEX>. You can virtually step back
        into the island‚Äôs history amid colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>, and

        Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wales</ENAMEX>

        the future <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George IV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, it is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> largest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaysia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX> is also the center for the country‚Äôs electronics industry.
        It was also a key retreat for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> hippy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, lured
        especially to the beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batu Ferringhi</ENAMEX> (see below). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is a blend of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and modern skyscrapers, and the
        contrast is striking. Move from the rich, scented air surrounding the
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> to such modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>-story

        historic section is the opportunity to cover many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in this
        compact area by foot. And the best place to begin your tour is at the
        main ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weld Quay</ENAMEX>. There along the foreshore is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kampung Ayer</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Village</ENAMEX>, better known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clan Piers</ENAMEX>,
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on stilts, joined by wooden walkways over the water
        and inhibited by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,000 boatmen</NUMEX> or fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, each group
        belonging to a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX>.
        At the other end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pengkalan Weld</ENAMEX>, opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jam Besar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Penang Clock Tower</ENAMEX>) built to mark Queen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria‚Äôs Diamond Jubilee</ENAMEX>, and presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>. The

        Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Cornwallis</ENAMEX> (named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
        Cornwallis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor General</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>), which marks the spot where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Captain Light</ENAMEX> arrived on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 July 1786</TIMEX>. The greenery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX> and rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1810</TIMEX>. The cannon on the ramparts were never fired
        in defense of the harbor and these days are put to better use as slides
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">children‚Äôs playground</ENAMEX>. The oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seri Rambai</ENAMEX>;
        originally given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jahor</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, it was
        transported to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> steamer of
        the same name. If you see <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> in this barrel, this is likely to be
        an offering from a childless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> hoping for fertility, which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cannon</ENAMEX> is said to be able to bestow.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jin Tun Syed Sheh Barakban</ENAMEX> (also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Esplanade</ENAMEX>)
        runs between the waterfront and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padang</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX>. This area

        their brilliant white evocative of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era one hundred years ago</TIMEX>. The

        set among frangipani <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grave of Francis Light</ENAMEX>, who died

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Light‚</ENAMEX>Äôs statue stands at the entrance of the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farquhar</ENAMEX>. In fact, as no photograph of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Light</ENAMEX> himself was available, the

        founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adelaide</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is housed in

        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language school in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>. There is a fine collection
        of historical memorabilia as well as old paintings and etchings, and a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> bridal chamber. Also on show is one incongruous
        exhibit left by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Air Airforce</ENAMEX>: a bronze bust of the German
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser Wilhelm</ENAMEX> II. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Art Gallery</ENAMEX>, upstairs, has a display of batik

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the great monuments from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgetown‚Äôs</ENAMEX> colonial days

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brothers</ENAMEX> who also created the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raffles Hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinatown</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">heartland</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgetown‚</ENAMEX>Äôs chinatown is
        centered on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lebah Chulia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lebah Campbell</ENAMEX>, both of which run off the

        space and the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>. It is also an area favored by
        backpackers lured by cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and the chance of
        purchasing discounted air tickets. The famous flea market is now

        Wander around the neighborhood‚Äôs back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to admire
        the beautifully kept residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, many with elegantly carved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">teak</ENAMEX> window screens and doorways and handsome gold-and-black lacquered
        name plates. The more flamboyant are the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clan Houses</ENAMEX>, bulwarks of
        community solidarity. They combine temples for ancestral worship with
        meeting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> to settle local problems‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhousing</ENAMEX>, jobs, medical care,

        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> nearby date back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-19th century</TIMEX>. The ornate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestral temple Leong San Tong</ENAMEX> stands opposite a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> used for
        open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> opera and theater. To the left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> to the

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lebuh Leith</ENAMEX>, with its
        striking outer walls of a rich blue color, was built around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1860</TIMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thio Thaw Siat</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>. It is considered one of the best
        examples of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> architecture in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX>. The building
        is being restored, but its future purpose remains undecided.
        The busiest public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuan Yin</ENAMEX> Ten

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>. It is dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Goddess of Mercy</ENAMEX>, who is often
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with fertility rituals and other benevolent powers and as a
        result draws a wide range of both the rich and poor to pay respect. For
        newlyweds, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goddess</ENAMEX> is also identified with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> Boddhisattva
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fertility</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is protected by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> at the
        entrance and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guardian</ENAMEX> dragons on the roof. The atmosphere is heavy with
        the scent of burning joss-sticks mixed with aroma of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, scented
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX>, cakes, and roast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> offered on the altars to help
        solve family problems. This deity forms a bridge between traditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> beliefs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX>.
        On the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kapitan Kling Mosque</ENAMEX>, the
        state‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. The

        was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1883</TIMEX> and is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX>. Vividly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decorated</ENAMEX>, it is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subramaniam</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX> and
        destroyer of evil, who is the focus of worship during the Thaipusam
        festival held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early months of the year</TIMEX>.
        Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Center</ENAMEX>
        Away from the frenzy of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX>, the main
        sights of interest are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang Hill</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX>. The drive
        out along <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad Shah</ENAMEX> takes you past the rubber magnates‚Äô
        Neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palladian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, built during the boom that lasted

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> Wat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chayamangkalaram</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, on Lorong
        Burma, is famous for its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">108-ft-</ENAMEX>) long reclining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. The
        site for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX>. The gigantic naga serpents, mystical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> linking earth to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heaven</ENAMEX>, are the balustrades at the entrance of the meditation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>.
        Farther west, away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botanical Gardens</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-hectare (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">74-acre</NUMEX>) garden was created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1844</TIMEX>
        as a tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Curtis</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX>, who collected
        botanical specimens from the nearby hills. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Leaf monkeys</ENAMEX> and long-tailed
        macaques are among the wildlife. One is cautioned about eating food
        openly, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> are likely to view this as an invitation to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dine</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Dato Keramat</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Ayer Hitam</ENAMEX>, lead west of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">830 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,722 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level, which served
        as a colonial hill <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>, and is now
        popular as a weekend excursion for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>. Take a delightfully slow
        ride on the funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> (built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>) past bungalows and villas
        set amid handsome gardens for panoramic views of the island.
        Day-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trippers</ENAMEX> walk along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> through dense groves of bamboo to catch
        views of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birdwatchers</ENAMEX> look out for blue-tailed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bee</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX>, sunbirds, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spider-hunters</ENAMEX>.
        Above the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayer</ENAMEX> (also ‚ÄúAir‚Äù) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitam</ENAMEX> stands the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kek Lok Si (‚ÄúTemple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paradise‚Äù</ENAMEX>). It was founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beow Lean</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fujian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> who arrived in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penang</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1887</TIMEX>. The temple‚Äôs construction began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1890</TIMEX> and took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to complete. The centerpiece is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-tiered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pagoda</ENAMEX> of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Million Buddhas</ENAMEX>, which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> ft) high and dedicated to Tsi Tsuang
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>. The pagoda is actually a blend of three architectural styles, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> octagonal base, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">core</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Burmese</ENAMEX> peak. At the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tortoise Pond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> feed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> special <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äútortoise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biscuits</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Boulders</ENAMEX> on the grounds are covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        calligraphy of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confucian</ENAMEX> texts. Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> are
        statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laughing Buddha</ENAMEX>, radiating happiness; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sakyamuni Buddha</ENAMEX>,
        incarnation of the faith‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuan Yin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Goddess of Mercy</ENAMEX>.
        Around <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Island</ENAMEX>
        Away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgetown‚</ENAMEX>Äôs hectic, bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>
        heat, there is the chance to explore the remainder of the island. A

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kampungs</ENAMEX> and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is a blend of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rainforest</ENAMEX> and occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>, oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, pepper,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutmeg</ENAMEX>, cloves, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>. A tour around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> can be
        accomplished in just a day, although overnight accommodation away from
        the beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> is limited.
        Also northwest <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">91‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX> are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batu Ferringhi</ENAMEX>, or simply ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ÄúForeigner‚Äôs Rock</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
        including the sandy beaches and rows of luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offering
        waterskiing, sailing, windsurfing, water scooters, horseback riding,
        and other sports. (There are also small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX> in the region
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> on a budget. ) While the beaches are sandy, they may
        prove disappointing to those who have travelled on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaysia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        northeastern coastline.
        On a journey around the island, there are several
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stopovers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Batu Maung</ENAMEX>, which offers scenic views and a
        seafood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> on stilts over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungei Pinang</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantai Aceh</ENAMEX> are small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> reached by turning west off the
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. For fishing and snorkeling, stop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teluk Bahang</ENAMEX> and hire a
        boat out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muka</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> on the island‚Äôs northwest tip.
        If a watery adventure is not what you seek, you can trek
        through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantai Acheh Forest Reserve</ENAMEX>. The reserve covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 20 sq</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 sq miles</NUMEX>) of the northwest corner of the island. With only
        camping available as accommodation and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> denied access to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>, the reward comes in sighting wildlife like wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>,
        leopard-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>, slow loris, flying lemurs, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">leaf monkeys</ENAMEX>, macaques, and
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squirrels</ENAMEX>. The landscape is dotted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite outcrops</ENAMEX>.
        Near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teluk Bahang‚Äôs</ENAMEX> town centre is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cultural Centre</ENAMEX>,
        which features art and crafts and music and dance, as well as
        traditional architecture from elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>. At the southern
        end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Teluk Bahang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penang Butterfly Farm</ENAMEX>, which boasts
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of different specimens fluttering around a netted enclosure of

        A tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) from Teluk
        Bahang, is unique in that it has cultivated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> types of exotic fruit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> on its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 acres</NUMEX>) since its opening in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.
        Birdwatchers gather around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genting</ENAMEX>, one of the world‚Äôs largest nesting

        As the road turns north again past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayan</ENAMEX>
        Lepas, watch out for signs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Snake Temple</ENAMEX> or, more correctly, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Azure Cloud</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometers</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">71‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) south from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgetown</ENAMEX>, it was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1850</TIMEX> as a dedication to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chor Soo Kong</ENAMEX>, who gained fame in his ability to heal. After the temple

        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> and they were accorded sacred status. Although poisonous,
        they are supposedly doped harmless by the incense smoke. A few are said
        to have had their teeth pulled, and the monks will be happy to drape
        them around the shoulders of a photograph-seeking tourist. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smile,</ENAMEX>

        Via the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungai Petani</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bedong</ENAMEX>, a left turn
        takes you to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merbok</ENAMEX> to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candi Bukit Batu Pahat</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiselled Stone Hill</ENAMEX>). This is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> now

        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">century b.c. More artifacts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, lingams (phallic symbols), stone

        Extending beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Jerai</ENAMEX> lie rolling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>, fed
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Muda River</ENAMEX> irrigation system, stretching up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perlis</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX> and along the coastline from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kedah State</ENAMEX>
        capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alor Setar</ENAMEX>, is the last stop before the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> border, and its
        history is a sad catalogue of invasion and subjugation, mostly by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thais</ENAMEX>. In the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is the traditional padang (square),
        here dominated by a fountain and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kedah</ENAMEX> monument. The Masjid
        Zahir, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>, is located on the square‚Äôs western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX>, its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> architecture highlighted at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> by myriad small lights.
        Standing majestically nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balai Besar</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> style for the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>. Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masjid Zahir</ENAMEX> is the
        impressive octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balai Nobat</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> where the royal nobat drums,
        flutes, and gongs are stored. Nobat, the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX>, is played
        during royal ceremonies; however, it is not open to the public. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Museum</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 15 minutes</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, was built
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1736</TIMEX>, and is worth a visit for its collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunga Mas</ENAMEX> and Bunga
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perak</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> made of real gold and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>), which were sent to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> as tribute.
        At the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Kedah</ENAMEX>, also a departure point
        for ferries to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langkawi</ENAMEX>, you can see the remains of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fort</ENAMEX> and sample some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>,
        especially crab.
        Malaysia‚Äôs smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perlis</ENAMEX>, also marks a change of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scenery</ENAMEX>, from the flat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> lands to solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">limestone</ENAMEX> outcrops, which
        are viewed as guardians to subterranean caves. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arau</ENAMEX>,
        the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Padang Besar</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> rail
        systems meet. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Perlis</ENAMEX>, south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kangar</ENAMEX>, is the
        departure point for the less than an hour‚Äôs ferry journey to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi</ENAMEX>.
        It is also a good location to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inexpensive fruit</ENAMEX> at the local
        market.
        Pulau Langkawi
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Langkawi</ENAMEX> island <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, a cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> islands,
        some of which disappear under the high tide, have been a focal point in
        Malaysia‚Äôs tourism promotion. But tourism in the area is centered on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulau Langkawi</ENAMEX> and its array of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 56</NUMEX> holiday resorts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. For
        the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuah</ENAMEX> is your arrival point, while those coming by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX> will touch down at the international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) northwest from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuah</ENAMEX> has some good <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling a range of goods at
        duty-free rates. Kuah‚Äôs town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is dominated by a sculpture of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giant eagle</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Langkawi</ENAMEX> means red eagle in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>). Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is
        a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty hectares</NUMEX> of landscaped gardens.
        To discover <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs
        possible to rent four-wheel-drive and standard <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, but many find
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bicycles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycles</ENAMEX> the most attractive way to explore the island
        and reach the more secluded beaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swimmers</ENAMEX> should be careful of
        powerful currents at most of the beaches.
        Most accommodation is located near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> or within
        easy reach of the international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> near Kuah
        include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton Perdana, Langkawi Seaview Hotel</ENAMEX>, and The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>
        Langkawi, while those closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, on the island‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southwestern</ENAMEX> tip, include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi Village Resort</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi Holiday</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa, Lanai Langkawi</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Awana Porto Malai</ENAMEX>. But there are plenty
        of beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chalets</ENAMEX> and huts located at the beaches around the island.
        Development at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantai Cenang</ENAMEX> is among the most extensive
        on the island. An <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> here, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underwater World</ENAMEX>, is reputed to be one
        of the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 5,000</NUMEX> marine and freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tasik Dayang Bunting</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake of the Pregnant Maiden</ENAMEX>), the largest
        freshwater lake in all the islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi</ENAMEX>, is accompanied by the
        fable of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kedah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX> who drank the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lake‚Äôs water</ENAMEX> and became
        pregnant.
        On the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">cape of Pulau Langkawi</ENAMEX> is Tanjung Rhu
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casuarina Bay</ENAMEX>). From here a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> journey is the only way to reach the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gua Cerita</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave of Legends</ENAMEX>), inscribed with writings from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koran</ENAMEX>.
        Other beaches to visit include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantai Kok, Pantai Tengah</ENAMEX>,
        Datai, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burau Bay</ENAMEX>. Historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">romantics</ENAMEX> may be interested to know
        that the islands were a favored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hideaway</ENAMEX> for the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> who
        preyed on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX> Straits. The absence of a detailed,
        legitimate history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has led some to cultivate its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mythology</ENAMEX>. One such fable surrounds the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Makam Mahsuri</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahsuri‚Äôs Tomb</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuah</ENAMEX>, consists of a white
        marble monument set amidst a picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> pays
        tribute to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> wrongly executed for adultery more than 200 years
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>. As the legend has it, she bled white blood, a testament to her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">innocence</ENAMEX>, and in her dying words cursed the island for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>.
        As a change of pace, beach-goers might be interested in a
        jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trek</ENAMEX> across the middle of the island. Guided tours can be
        arranged for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hilly Gunnung Raya and Machinchang Forest Reserves</ENAMEX>,
        where a wide array of wildlife can be viewed; birdwatchers will also be
        rewarded on these treks. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the easier walks takes you over to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Durian Perangin Waterfall</ENAMEX>.
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pulau Singa Besar Wildlife Sanctuary</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south of Kuah</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">640 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,581 acres</NUMEX>) filled
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse-deer</ENAMEX>, iguanas, and peacocks.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> include a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Craft Cultural Complex</ENAMEX> on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langkawi</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teluk Yu</ENAMEX>, and near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, Kampung

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johor</ENAMEX>
        Malaysia‚Äôs less-visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> coast offers the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> a
        slower pace set against the beauty of the region‚Äôs beaches and the
        richness of its forests. The region covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four states‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇKelantan</NUMEX>,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johor Bahru</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a causeway‚Äôs</NUMEX> distance from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>. Historically
        resistant to many of the major changes in the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, the
        region has been able to maintain is authentic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> culture and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX>
        traditions. Traditional handicrafts, including the making of spinning
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tops</ENAMEX>, kites, silverware, baskets, and batik, not to mention
        shadow-puppet shows, are still practiced in many of the rural kampung
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kelantan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terengganu</ENAMEX>.
        The east coast‚Äôs beaches are less developed and offer
        opportunities for snorkeling and diving. Wildlife <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> can enter
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">region‚Äôs forests</ENAMEX> for jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trekking</ENAMEX> and adventure travel. The
        region also offers the chance to see leatherback <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> coming to lay
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cherating</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuantan</ENAMEX> or to view the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuala</ENAMEX>

        was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1844</TIMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammad II</ENAMEX> and is now only opened for
        ceremonial occasions (closed to the public). Inside is a throne <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> furniture, and a royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barge</ENAMEX>, used only once in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>.
        On the other side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, along <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibrahim</ENAMEX> and

        its rural <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX> artwork and earthenware pots. The best view of living

        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Mahmood</ENAMEX> opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perdana Hotel</ENAMEX>, with performances that

        Around Kota Bharu
        Within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just a few kilometers</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kota Bharu</ENAMEX>, you can find
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master silversmiths</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> batik weavers, but the maze of country
        lanes around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> could make it difficult to find the kampung
        communities where the artisans still ply their traditional skills. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX> may be recommended, with the assistance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Centre</ENAMEX>.
        Kelatan‚Äôs silversmiths use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> techniques, the ‚Äúfiligree‚Äù
        and ‚Äúrepousse,‚Äù and items range from the purely ornamental to the
        functional. Silvercraft <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> can be visited at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kampung Sireh</ENAMEX>,
        along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jalan Sultanah Zainab</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kampung Marak</ENAMEX> (also called Kampung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Badang</ENAMEX>), on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantai Cahaya Bulan</ENAMEX> (PCB). Also on the way to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantai Cahaya Bulan</ENAMEX>, you can see the skill and beauty of kain songket,
        richly woven materials of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and silver thread, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kampung Penambang</ENAMEX>.
        Songket was the product of the region‚Äôs early trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> (with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silk</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> (with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and silver thread). Indigenous to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelantan</ENAMEX>,
        batik weavers are found throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, but the bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>
        are to be found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kampung Puteh, Kubur Kuda</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kampung Badang</ENAMEX>.
        Kite-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> also practice their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-old</TIMEX> skills throughout
        the region, and while tradition would have the art passed from father
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, many fear the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> now lacks the patience to
        carry out the skilled handiwork required.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the oldest mosques in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> is to be found at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nilam Puri</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> had been dismantled from its site closer to the
        river after repeated flooding at its original location at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kampung Laut</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> was built entirely without the use of nails.
        Kelantan‚Äôs ancient links with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> are evident in the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai Buddhist</ENAMEX> Temples you will see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-hidden among the

        Kelantan‚Äôs white sandy beaches are within easy access of

        Most popular is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pantai Cahaya Bulan, or Moonlight Beach</ENAMEX>. It was

        To the south, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantai Irama (‚ÄúMelody Beach‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 25 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kota Bharu</ENAMEX>; it is one of the most beautiful along the

        has buoyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, something you‚Äôll see reflected in the skyline and
        busy traffic of the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Terengganu</ENAMEX>. So far the economic
        gains have failed to detract from the town‚Äôs relaxed charm. The main
        options for traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terengganu</ENAMEX> are direct flights from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX> or
        interstate bus to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Terengganu</ENAMEX>, which is generally the starting

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX>.

        can be made to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bukit Keluang</ENAMEX>, just on the coast, for swimming,
        snorkeling, or windsurfing, with caves easily reached by walkways.
        The islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulau Perhentian Kecil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulau Perhentian</ENAMEX>
        Besar are reached after a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13-mile</NUMEX>) journey which takes up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. The islands‚Äô main reputations lie in their being lush and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tropical</ENAMEX>, with clear blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> and coal reefs protected as part of
        Malaysia‚Äôs marine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>. On both islands accommodations range from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lavish</ENAMEX> resorts to chalets to huts.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulau Perhentian Besar</ENAMEX> lies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulau Redang</ENAMEX>, some

        though there still lies the promise of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>-clear waters for scuba

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merang</ENAMEX> (not to be confused with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marang</ENAMEX> farther south).
        There are also resorts on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulau Lang Tengah</ENAMEX>, just north from Redang
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands</ENAMEX>. Boats take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merang</ENAMEX> to reach the island.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuala Terengganu</ENAMEX>
        This lively <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX>, bordered by the Terengganu
        River and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX>, is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in the state and has
        fast progressed from a sleepy fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX>, colorful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a wide range of accommodations available, a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> of interest along the
        town‚Äôs waterfront. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, built on an estuary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ibai River</ENAMEX>,
        gives the illusion that it is floating on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        Back in town, a waterfront stroll takes you through
        Chinatown on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Bandar</ENAMEX>. The old terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on both sides of
        the road create an attractive sense of timelessness even as the betting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> do a lively <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> trade. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Bandar</ENAMEX> leads you to the Pasar

        For excellent views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, try the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">219-ft</ENAMEX>)

        stairs you‚Äôll find an old fort which was used in a local civil war in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>. The view overlooks the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istana Maziah</ENAMEX>, the sultan‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX>, but it is not open to the public.
        Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masjid Zanial Abidin</ENAMEX> was originally

        A short river cruise from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> will take you to the

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX>, whose reputations extend far beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>. Many

        hawksbill, the common green, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Ridley</ENAMEX>. The beach, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">38 miles</NUMEX>) south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Terengganu</ENAMEX>, is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> places in
        the world visited by these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> between the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of May</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> extends <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) on
        either side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rantau Abang</ENAMEX>. Special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hatcheries</ENAMEX> have been set aside,
        where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> are collected from the initial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> and reburied in a
        safe location. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turtle Information Centre</ENAMEX> is located north of the
        village.
        It is in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight to dawn hours</TIMEX> that the female
        leatherbacks, up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21‚ÅÑ2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 ft</ENAMEX>) in length and weighing sometimes over
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">375 kg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">825 lb</NUMEX>), make their way up the beach. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daylight hours</TIMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beach‚Äôs sparkling waters</ENAMEX> and ambience are enough reason to
        visit.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> before ecological awareness, the devastating
        insensitivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">onlookers</ENAMEX> treated the turtles‚Äô rendezvous as a popular
        spectacle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Crowds</ENAMEX> gathered in festive mood to build campfires on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>, dance to the blare of radios, photograph by blinding flashlight
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turtles‚Äô night-time egg</ENAMEX> laying, even ride the backs of the giant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leatherbacks</ENAMEX> and poke open their heavy-lidded eyes. This human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stupidity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> pollution almost put a stop to this natural
        phenomenon. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> number of leatherbacks visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rantau</ENAMEX> Abang
        declined from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,000</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">barely a few hundred</NUMEX> by the
        end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. At this point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fisheries</ENAMEX> department
        stepped into protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Authorities</ENAMEX> have banned the use of
        flash photography or flashlights, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> must be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ft) from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>. But still, not all will follow the guidelines. High tide
        on a full moon is the most likely time to sight a leatherback coming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ashore</ENAMEX>, but there are no guarantees.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanjung Jara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Points South</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> south from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rantau Abang</ENAMEX>, heading towards
        Kuanten, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pahang</ENAMEX>, passes through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanjung Jara</ENAMEX>.
        Here, the award-winning accommodations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beach Hotel</ENAMEX> contrast with
        the rapid industrialization from the offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and gas exploration
        in the region. Farther south is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Dungun</ENAMEX>, predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and a location for excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> can be hired
        from here to the island to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulau Tenggol</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 miles</NUMEX>) offshore, so
        you can go snorkeling among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">angelfish</ENAMEX>. The center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terengganu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        petroleum industry is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerteh</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refineries</ENAMEX> and gasworks. But
        there are some pretty beaches at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kerten River</ENAMEX>
        nonetheless.
        Pahang
        The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the peninsula also boasts the longest
        river, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">475-km-</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">296-mile-</NUMEX>) long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pahang</ENAMEX>. Although its most famous
        sights lie far to the west in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genting</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron Highlands</ENAMEX>, Padang
        has its share of beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, including the renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulau</ENAMEX> Tioman
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tioman Island</ENAMEX>) in the far south (though access by sea is from the port
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mersing</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johor</ENAMEX>). The recently developed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Endau Rompin State Park</ENAMEX>,
        straddling the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, compliments the better known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taman Negara</ENAMEX> in the far north, which has its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> access through the
        state capital Kuanten. Padang‚Äôs other natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beauties</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chini</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast</ENAMEX>
        Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">47 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuantan</ENAMEX> is the beach resort
        area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cherating</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club Mediterran√©e</ENAMEX> set up its first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club Med</ENAMEX> is not alone along the beachfront. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> in
        close proximity to the state‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> are located at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balok Beach</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyatt Hotel Kuantan</ENAMEX> has joined other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Teluk</ENAMEX> Chempedak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beach</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) out of the bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The beautiful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pelindung Beach</ENAMEX> is just a short trek through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teluk Chempedak Forest</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, green <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> and the occasional giant
        leatherback may be seen under moonlight skies when they lay their eggs
        on the beach. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beserah Beach</ENAMEX>, also close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuantan</ENAMEX>, the local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> still employ buffalo to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> carrying their catch
        to the market, though a batik <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> and several cottage handicraft
        workshops may disappoint the more sophisticated souvenir-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX>. You
        will find a pleasant beach nearby at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batu Hitam</ENAMEX>.
        Kuantan
        Despite a rather glum reputation among some guidebooks,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuantan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX> offers a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, a lively shopping and
        market <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, and a quiet ambience next to the river where good
        eating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> are found. Built on the fortunes from tin mining, the
        capital is now a commercial center for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pahang‚Äôs oil</ENAMEX>, palm, and other
        industries, and a key link in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">petroleum</ENAMEX> and gas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pipelines</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find an array of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, which, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Min Heng</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1926</TIMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tong Nam Ah Hotel</ENAMEX>, have interesting
        backgrounds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mega View Hotel</ENAMEX> near the river tries to say it all in
        its name. But there are also several new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> near the river and in
        sight of the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masjid Negeri</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shahzan Inn</ENAMEX>. On the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Masjid</ENAMEX>, is the cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infokraf</ENAMEX>), and just
        opposite is an open sports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan A. Aziz</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jalan Besar</ENAMEX> is hectic with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, wares, and an occasional
        money-lender. The local village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selamat</ENAMEX> is known for its fine kain
        songket silk brocade.
        Just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuantan</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gua Charas</ENAMEX>, a cave temple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">151‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) northeast and built into one of the limestone outcrops
        surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">cave</ENAMEX>, known as the ‚Äúyawning skull
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cave</ENAMEX>,‚Äù echoing with the sound of bats, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>-ft) reclining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>
        is to be found among the illuminated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>.
        Pekan
        The sleepy old royal capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pahang</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 miles</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south of Kuantan</ENAMEX>, is still the sultan‚Äôs official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. Upstream on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pahang River</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sultan‚Äôs gleaming palace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Istana Abu Bakar</ENAMEX>, is
        set among immaculate green polo fields. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilded</ENAMEX> and sapphire-blue domes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grace</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> white marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mosques</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sultan‚Äôs mausoleum</ENAMEX>. Nearby, the
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays glories of the old sultanate and
        treasures of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> junk salvaged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX>. The town
        also boasts a silk-weaving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, located at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kampung Pulau Keladi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pekan</ENAMEX>.
        Tasik Chini
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chini</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> beautiful lakes surrounded by
        forested hills south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pehang River</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>) west of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuantan</ENAMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, much of the surface is covered by
        white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lotus blossoms</ENAMEX>. The myth-shrouded lakes are said to be the home
        of giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, dragons, and other monsters, one of which, according
        to local myth, swam to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tioman Island</ENAMEX>.
        Archeological explorations suggest there are ruins of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer</ENAMEX>
        settlement beneath the surface. Outside lotus-blossom <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, the lakes
        are still a delight to visit, with good fishing for the local toman.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jakun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> dwell on the lakeshore. It may be
        possible to pay a discreet visit to one of their hamlets, Kampung
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gumum</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tioman Island</ENAMEX>
        The combination of first-rate resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and
        magnificent natural beauty makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tioman</ENAMEX> one of the finest islands in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. Preserved from logging, most of the rainforest has remained. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hilly ridge</ENAMEX> runs down the middle of the island at an altitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 m</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,640 ft</NUMEX>), rising at the southern end to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite peaks‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>) high.
        You can reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tioman</ENAMEX> by flying from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuantan</ENAMEX> or by taking
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> from the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mersing</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúslow boat‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        and the ‚Äúfast boat‚Äù both end up taking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX>.
        On the island‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west coast</ENAMEX>, you have the choice between
        the top-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tioman Island Resort Hotel</ENAMEX> and the more modest but
        comfortable guest-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, chalets, and simpler cabins on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Salang Beach</ENAMEX>
        farther north. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Facilities</ENAMEX> around the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island port</ENAMEX> of Tekek include
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, where long-tailed macaques act as unofficial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caddies</ENAMEX> who
        do not always give the ball back.
        Most trips around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> will be by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> charge a reasonable fee. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tekek</ENAMEX>, make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jungle Trek</ENAMEX>
        over the hill to the east coast. Cool off on the way with a dip at the
        hilltop waterfall, them make your way down to the beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juara</ENAMEX>, a
        village serving excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana pancakes</ENAMEX>. Take another
        swim in the sea, and if you do not feel like trekking back, return to
        Tekek by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birdwatchers</ENAMEX> will see green pied imperial pigeons,
        bulbuls, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frigate birds</ENAMEX>, sunbirds, and flower-peckers.
        Characteristically for island <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, there are no large mammals.

        resorts such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desaru</ENAMEX> on the southeast and the islands offshore from

        upon reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kluang</ENAMEX>, detour to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kahang</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. From there, only a
        four-wheel drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> will take you along the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">56-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35-mile</NUMEX>) jungle
        track to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kampung Peta</ENAMEX>, where there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor center</ENAMEX> and point of
        entry to the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>. Otherwise, you can get there via a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hour</TIMEX> boat journey from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Felda Nitar</ENAMEX> II. There are also a wide
        range of quite strident regulations governing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> usage and duration
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desaru</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islands North</ENAMEX>
        The southeast corner of the peninsula was originally
        exploited only for its oil-palm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>. Today, tourism drives the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, and its high-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> share <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) of golden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sands</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desaru</ENAMEX> is accessible by road by way of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kota Tinggi</ENAMEX>, or by
        following the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johor Bahru</ENAMEX>. If traveling through Kota
        Tinggi, it might be worthwhile to make a stopover to see the
        spectacular waterfall at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lembong</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">91‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) north from the

        major beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>. There are several top-end resorts
        and golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> here, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desaru Golden Beach Hotel</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resort</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desaru View Hotel</ENAMEX>, but budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> will also find
        chalet accommodation available.
        Off the coast from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mersing</ENAMEX>, there are
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">islands‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇPulau Rawa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulau Tengah, Pulau Besar, Pulau Tinggi</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pulau Sibu‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇoffering</ENAMEX> white sandy beaches, coral reefs, and budget

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johor Bahru</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Citizens</ENAMEX> of prosperous but staid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> cross the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causeway</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johor‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX> to escape for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> and sample
        its lively nightlife, to shop, or to head farther north. Outside the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can visit the sprawling market, and
        nearby along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lido Waterfront</ENAMEX> take a look at the gleaming white
        marble of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sultan Abu Bakar Mosque</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Museum</ENAMEX>, and the Istana
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardens</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and zoo put
        together from the sultan‚Äôs private menagerie.
        The neoclassical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istana Besar Palace</ENAMEX> is now used only for
        state ceremonies, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> sultans having moved up the coast to

        Other sights include the colonial-style clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> overlooking the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Datan Bandaraya</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Square</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Johor Art Gallery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX>),
        built in a similar period style, exhibits clothing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, currency,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitam</ENAMEX>. But before heading towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Melaka</ENAMEX>, gourmets turn off west at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sekudai</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and back south to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kukup</ENAMEX>, a small fishing
        village <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johor Bahru</ENAMEX>.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayer Hitam</ENAMEX>, a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese-style</ENAMEX> pottery is on
        display beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> market, where there is an excellent selection
        of rambutans, pineapples, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>, as well as locally made nougat
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>-cakes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> of of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batu Pahat</ENAMEX> also offers
        respectable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The town witnessed a historic Melaka
        naval victory over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1456</TIMEX>. The fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muar</ENAMEX> was
        of trading importance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, as can be
        seen in the graceful old Neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Classical</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. It was also
        the scene of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX> troops‚Äô heroic but abortive last stand
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> advance on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1942</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX>
        From jungles to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX>
        offer enough adventure and natural beauty to make the journey across
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX> worthwhile. These sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Borneo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhose</ENAMEX> name
        has miraculously not lost its romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">magic‚</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare</ENAMEX> sorely tried by the
        modern onslaughts of oil drilling, voracious logging of lucrative
        belian hardwood, and of tourism itself. But such images as
        cloud-engulfed mountain-tops, a tattooed and decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iban</ENAMEX> at a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">riverside</ENAMEX> longhouse, a bustling produce market, a beachside retreat
        bordering upon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise waters</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an orang-utan</NUMEX> sitting in lazy
        attitude all mark some side of the genuine adventure which awaits the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveler</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Malaysia</ENAMEX>. From shopping for exotic souvenirs and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">craftwork</ENAMEX> to dining in a seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> to the thrill of riding in
        a longboat along <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river ‚Äúhighways‚Äù</ENAMEX> deep in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, it is all there
        for the choosing.
        The history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúWhite Rajah‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> lineage that
        commenced with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventurer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Brooke</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1830s</TIMEX> and lasted until
        the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇstill</ENAMEX> lies intact in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sawawak‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        capital.
        But away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> lies some natural prizes:
        Borneo‚Äôs highest mountain (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Kinabalu</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX>), its longest river
        (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rejang</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarawak</ENAMEX>), its myriad caves (including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Niah Caves</ENAMEX> in

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">snorkeling</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX>-watching.
        Getting around can be a challenge. The rivers, more
        numerous and much longer than on the peninsula, still provide the
        principal way into the interior, supplemented by smaller aircraft
        operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaysia Airlines</ENAMEX>.
        Sarawak
        It is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</TIMEX> by air from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuching</ENAMEX>, the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) from the mountains on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> border to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX>. The wealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river systems</ENAMEX> among the jungle terrain provides a
        vital link that will transport you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of the rainforest and
        the chance to experience life in their longhouses first-hand. Between
        river cruises or treks through the rainforest of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bako National Park</ENAMEX>,
        you can relax at the beachside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santubong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Damai</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 40 minutes</TIMEX>
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX>. In eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarawak</ENAMEX>, you can pursue more strenuous but

        Don‚Äôt be surprised if upon arrival on a domestic flight
        you are asked to show your passport for immigration formalities.
        Kuching
        Unlike the other major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East Malaysia‚</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇMiri</ENAMEX>, Kota
        Kinabalu, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sandakan‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇSarawak‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state capital</ENAMEX> has preserved its
        colonial charm, having been spared the bombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. Kuching
        is built on a bend of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sarawak River</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 miles</NUMEX>) from the sea.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Rajahs</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>) lie on
        the north <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, while on the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> is the greater part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and several
        colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, the past‚Äôs permanent vestiges.
        The colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Post Office</ENAMEX>,
        noteworthy for its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1930s Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> design and pillars, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courthouse</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courthouse site</ENAMEX> was originally a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutheran</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Brooke</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Rajahs</ENAMEX>, turned it
        into a judicial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration office</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1858</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demolished</ENAMEX>, making away for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and later a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (the

        meetings continued to be held there until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it houses the
        High <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Court</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magistrates Court</ENAMEX>. The clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, whose bells still
        chime on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX>, was added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1883</TIMEX>. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Brooke Memorial</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six meters</NUMEX> in height, which was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">remembrance</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second White Rajah</ENAMEX>.
        Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Esplanade</ENAMEX>, north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX>, is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Square Tower</ENAMEX>, and on its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floor</ENAMEX> is an information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and
        multimedia theater.
        West of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Courthouse</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jalan India</ENAMEX>, a pedestrian mall
        marking the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Sarawak‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Mosque</ENAMEX>, built
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1850s</TIMEX>, is here. Still farther west, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuching Mosque</ENAMEX>, built in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, located near the markets, is best seen from the other side of the
        river. A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> has also been built on the north side of the
        River.
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Market</ENAMEX> is located on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Gambier</ENAMEX>, near
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">esplanade</ENAMEX>. Here fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> are sold, as
        well as clothes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>, and CDs. Nearby are the bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and
        taxi stand.
        Despite new high-rise construction underway, the myriad
        traditional shophouses‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇboth Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Indian‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇensure the city‚Äôs
        former qualities are still within reach. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> shophouses along Jalan
        Padungan, mostly built during the rubber boom of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s and 1930s</TIMEX>,
        offer a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and handicraft
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
        More colorful is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sunday Market</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Satok</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm</ENAMEX>, which actually starts late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and extends through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, offering a bewildering array of items; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dayaks</ENAMEX> come to sell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and handicrafts and even more exotic items from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forest</ENAMEX>, such as lizards, bats, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Courthouse</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tua Pek Ko</ENAMEX> ng <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> and the

        that line the river. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siew San Teng</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1876</TIMEX> and is the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX>; it remains an

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarawak</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuek Seng Ong Temple</ENAMEX>, on

        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The ground floor was the location for many
        garden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> hosted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajahs</ENAMEX>; it was also used an internment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> of war during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. It is now the
        residence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuching</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yang Di-Pertuan Negeri</ENAMEX>. Set
        among beautiful grounds, it is unfortunately not open to the
        public.
        Up the hill to the right from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astana</ENAMEX>, the road leads
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Margherita</ENAMEX>, now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muzium Polis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Museum</ENAMEX>). The
        white-turreted edifice was built by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Brooke</ENAMEX> along the lines
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval castle</ENAMEX> and named after his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret</ENAMEX>. It was
        converted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX> and is now open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 10am</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6pm</TIMEX>. You may need your passport to gain a free pass to
        enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. Inside, there are displays of police <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and
        simulated opium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dens</ENAMEX>, plus scenes of punishments once meted out to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>. A skull <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, there as a form of protection,
        offers a grisly reminder of another side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borneo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history.
        Back on the south side of the river, another colonial
        building is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Round Tower</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Tun Abang Haji Openg</ENAMEX>. It was
        originally designed as a dispensary when built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1880s</TIMEX>.
        Also south of the river on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Tun Haji Openg</ENAMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sawarak Museum</ENAMEX>, which has one of the best collections of folk art and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is divided between the
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, connected by a footbridge across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
        The former was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1891</TIMEX> and styled along the lines of a Normandy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">townhouse</ENAMEX>; it is devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sawarak‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rich history and many cultures.
        The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, has more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and archeological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exhibits</ENAMEX>, including a reconstruction of the early human settlements at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Niah Caves</ENAMEX>. There is a bookstore and souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>.
        Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum‚</ENAMEX>Äôs grounds there is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquarium</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botantic Gardens</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heroes Memorial</ENAMEX>, the latter commemorating the
        dead from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency</ENAMEX>, and the Confrontation with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>. Adjacent to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak Museum</ENAMEX> is the Muzium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Museum</ENAMEX>).
        Highlights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Wing</ENAMEX> include a reconstructed Iban
        Longhouse, complete with totem-pole, chieftains‚Äô hornbill-feather
        headdresses, and skulls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">head-hunting victims</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyah Tree of Life</ENAMEX>
        Mural, repainted from a longhouse at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Nawang</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Melanau</ENAMEX> dolls, which
        serve as charms against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> and to lure <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to traps; beads of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kelabit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; and specimens of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Russell Wallace‚</ENAMEX>Äôs extensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insect</ENAMEX> collection.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Wing</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        Sculptures; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> ceramics and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brassware</ENAMEX>; a model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niah Caves</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX>), with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bats</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> artifacts, and funeral <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> from the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighth century</TIMEX> a.d. A photographic history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuching</ENAMEX> is also
        rewarding.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuching</ENAMEX> also claims the world‚Äôs first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cat Museum</ENAMEX>, in honor
        of the city‚Äôs mascot (kuching means ‚Äúcat‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>).
        Around Kuching
        The fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and peninsula of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santubong</ENAMEX> is just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX>. There you will find beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> and cultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sights</ENAMEX>, plus opportunities for jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trekking</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> riding, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Santubong</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">810 m/2,470‚Äàft</NUMEX>), peers down on the broad, sandy
        beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Damai</ENAMEX>, where you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> along the long, sandy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>. Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sarawak Cultural Park</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 acres</NUMEX>) of
        craft demonstrations and cultural performances. Described as a ‚ÄúLiving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>,‚Äù it provides an opportunity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> short on time to
        gain a feel for the rich culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full- or half-day</TIMEX> tours
        are offered, with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shuttles</ENAMEX> available from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX>.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> and a rainforest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> at
        Damai, each offering a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports, jungle trekking trips,
        and cultural activities. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, both located at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teluk</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penyuk Beach</ENAMEX>, are managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Inn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> and are within easy
        reach of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cultural Park</ENAMEX>. Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cultural Park</ENAMEX>, there is access
        to local longhouses as well as trips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bako National Park</ENAMEX>, local
        fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, and nearby islands, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river cruises</ENAMEX> around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santubong Peninsula</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarawak</ENAMEX> there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> involved with the
        rehabilitation of the orang-utan. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matang Wildlife Centre</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX>, is to take over the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semengoh</ENAMEX>, which no
        longer maintains captive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matang</ENAMEX>, while the focus of their
        work is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orang-utans</ENAMEX>, there are enclosures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Sambar deer</ENAMEX>,
        crocodiles, sun bears, civets, and bear <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>, as well as aviaries
        holding hornbills, sea eagles, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> life from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarawak</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bako National Parks</ENAMEX>
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bako National Park</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kubah National Park</ENAMEX> are within
        easy reach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuching</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bako</ENAMEX> is also
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the smallest, covering just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 sq miles</NUMEX>), but it
        offers great opportunities to see a wide range of animal and plant
        life. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is located just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37 km/23 miles</NUMEX>) from
        Kuching, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> has a choice between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> trip or an overnight
        stay; accommodations include a resthouse, dormitories, and chalets. You
        must first travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kampung Bako</ENAMEX>, where you can get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to
        transport you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park headquarters</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telok Assam</ENAMEX>. The long-nosed,
        paunchy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">proboscis monkey</ENAMEX> is the major attraction, but also to be seen
        are silver leaf <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> and long-tail macaques. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse-deer</ENAMEX>, monitor
        lizards, and bird life, including sea eagles, also live here.
        Bako offers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 well</NUMEX>-marked, color-coded jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bridges</ENAMEX> over the swamps to the best spots for viewing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wildlife</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> lead off from the right of the park‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, just across from the arrival <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jalan</ENAMEX> Tanjong
        Sepi, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> steep climb up to the cliff-tops overlooking the bay
        that fronts the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park headquarters</ENAMEX>, is recommended.
        On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Lintang</ENAMEX>, a small observation hide at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Lintang Salt Lick</ENAMEX> offers the chance to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> at close
        quarters as they drink. Besides its good hilltop view over the jungle,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Bukit Tambi</ENAMEX> offers several specimens of carnivorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>:
        the bladderwort, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> plant, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sundew‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalso</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venus‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        fly-trap.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Telok Delima</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Telok Paku</ENAMEX> are the best
        trails for viewing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">proboscis monkey</ENAMEX>; they like to bed down in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> near the seashore. Very often, they will have been watching you
        long before you spot them, and if your presence upsets them, they will
        just honk and disappear. While at the seashore, keep a look out, too,
        for the hairy-nosed otter.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longhouse River</ENAMEX> Cruises
        The opportunity to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak</ENAMEX> in their
        forest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> is a privilege not to be missed. However, tours to some
        longhouses have acquired the artificial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a ‚Äútribal</NUMEX> theme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù Unfortunately, as tourism rises and the popularity of such
        expeditions increases, it is a trend difficult to escape, the only real
        alternative being to travel even farther into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> at added
        expense. But the adoption by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> of western clothing or such
        items as televisions and radios shouldn‚Äôt daunt the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>.
        On offer for the soft <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure traveler</ENAMEX> is a choice
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between a day</TIMEX> trip, an overnight stay at a guest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> near a
        longhouse, or a stay in a longhouse itself. Tours from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX> usually
        start very early and involve a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two- to five-hour</TIMEX> road journey to the
        river and then a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> cruise by longboat. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> usually
        have exclusive arrangements with particular longhouses.
        The format of the visit varies, but it may include
        cultural performances soon after arrival for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>-trippers or at the
        day‚Äôs end as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> entertainment for those staying longer. The
        standard tour is an initial orientation to the longhouse, highlighting
        the bilik (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>) as distinct from the ruai (communal areas). Tour
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are often greeted with tuak, a sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> made from glutinous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice</ENAMEX>, and a welcome dance. The musical and cultural performance
        includes a ngajat, a traditional Iban dance. Demonstrations of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blowpipe</ENAMEX> and cockfighting are also likely to be on the agenda.
        Before you leave, your tour guide will remind you to make
        sure that you have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gifts‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcigarettes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sweets</ENAMEX>, and little toys for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">children‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich</ENAMEX> can be bought during one of the bus stopovers earlier
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> tourism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> may also be able to offer
        advice on reputable tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX> who organize visits on a
        small scale so as not to offend tribal dignity.
        Around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuching</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are likely to visit a longhouse of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>, but tours are also available to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bidayuh</ENAMEX> longhouses
        found in the hill regions. Visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iban</ENAMEX> are likely along the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skrang</ENAMEX> or Batang-ai river. To the east of Kuching you can visit the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>. Excursions are organized either via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miri</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Baram</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">majestic Baram River</ENAMEX>, or via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sibu</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kapit</ENAMEX> or
        Belaga, up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rejang River</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rejang</ENAMEX> is considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaysia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        greatest river at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 560 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">350 miles</NUMEX>) long; a journey along the
        river is considered one of the world‚Äôs last great travel adventures.
        The approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belaga</ENAMEX> entails a passage through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rejang‚</ENAMEX>Äôs Pelegus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rapids</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> in all, each with its own name: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bidai</ENAMEX> (big
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mat</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nabau</ENAMEX> (python), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lunggak</ENAMEX> (dagger), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sago</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sukat</ENAMEX> (measure),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mawang</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>), and most ominously, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rapoh</ENAMEX> (tomb).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niah Caves</ENAMEX>
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niah Caves</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> see the earliest traces of homo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sapiens</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>; they lived in the area <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 40,000 years ago</TIMEX>.
        Later the caves were used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial ground</ENAMEX>, and they are now the
        hunting-ground of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> of the cave-roof bird‚Äôs nests. The caves
        and surrounding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,149</NUMEX>-hectare (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,775-acre</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">480 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 miles</NUMEX>)
        up the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuching</ENAMEX>, hidden within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Miri Forests</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adventurer A. Hart Everett</ENAMEX> came across the caves in the
        1870s, but it was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> that local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explorer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak Museum</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curator Tom Harrison</ENAMEX> made the important discovery of a human skull
        dating back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 37,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, together with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,200-year-old</TIMEX> red
        hematite rock paintings. The fragments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Skull</ENAMEX> (so-called
        because it was found deep within an ancient pile of bat guano),
        together with tools, earthenware pots, jars, and later bronze jewelry
        found nearby are on display at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuching Museum</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batu Niah</ENAMEX>, is midway between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bintulu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miri</ENAMEX>, a boomtown known for its oil exploration
        and recovery. The caves are accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, taking
        at least <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miri</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bintulu</ENAMEX>. The park‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> is at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pangkalan Lubang</ENAMEX>, and you will need to obtain a

        plank <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> to the caves. For the cave tour, be sure to take a

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traders Cave</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to be seen, so-called
        because of its role as a meeting place of bird‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX>-gatherers and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>. The original <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Niah people‚</NUMEX>Äôs decline is something of a
        mystery; their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forefathers</ENAMEX> may be the nomadic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penan</ENAMEX>, who traded the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nests</ENAMEX> and hornbill <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> and beads.
        The main or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Cave</ENAMEX> is a hollow <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">400 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,1312 ft</NUMEX>) up in
        the sandstone Subis plateau. Besides some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> crickets and scorpions
        (from which the extension of the boardwalk through the cave keeps you
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">safe</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Great Cave</ENAMEX> is home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bats</ENAMEX> and swiftlets. The
        Deep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skull</ENAMEX> and other relics were discovered here.
        The bats‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> droppings furnish <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one ton</NUMEX> of highly valued
        guano <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX>. But more lucrative than the guano are the swiftlets‚Äô
        edible nests, for which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> are prepared to pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> per kilo (of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 100</NUMEX> nests), reselling them for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>,
        to make bird‚Äôs-nest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> are increasingly concerned
        about the impact of the on-going harvest on the swiftlets‚Äô survival.
        The rush of nesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">swiftlets</ENAMEX> flying into the cave at day‚Äôs end while
        the nocturnal bats <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush past</TIMEX> into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> sky is a spectacular
        sight.
        The boardwalk continues through the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Great Cave</ENAMEX> down to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Painted Cave</ENAMEX>, also accessible without a guide. Discovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> along
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Skull</ENAMEX>, its wall-paintings representing red stick figures
        of spread-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eagle dancers</ENAMEX> were executed in a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">betel juice</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lime</ENAMEX> around a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX>. This cave was probably also used as a burial

        Nearby are the several jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jalan</ENAMEX> Bukit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kasut</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jalan Madu</ENAMEX> both clearly marked. Be on the lookout for the

        stay to be fully appreciated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">The trip</ENAMEX> is a quite demanding adventure,
        and you need to be in good shape, especially if you are looking to
        undertake the climb to the limestone-sculptured pinnacles on Gunung Api
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Mountain</ENAMEX>).
        A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35-minute</TIMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miri</ENAMEX> arrives at the airstrip near

        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miri</ENAMEX> and is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-stage trip. First, you travel by bus or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Baram</ENAMEX>, at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batang Baram</ENAMEX>. From here, you take an

        are either too dangerous or too ecologically fragile to visit without
        special permits and qualified guides.
        Away from the show caves, expect some crawling around on
        hands and knees or wading chest-deep through underground streams. The
        best guides will provide miner‚Äôs helmets with built-in lamps to explore
        the pitch-black caves. Your own equipment should include very strong
        shoes made of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX> than than leather, lots of socks, tough old

        To give you an idea of the scale of the caverns, Sarawak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber</ENAMEX>, the most recently explored cave (and reputed to be the largest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cave</ENAMEX> in the world) is said to be capable of holding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX>.

        Nearest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park‚Äôs headquarters</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deer Cave and</ENAMEX>

        burial ground, as other caves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> were used. Like many other

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clearwater</ENAMEX> and Wind caves are reached by longboat from

        match these gigantic stone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">needles</ENAMEX> thrusting like petrified hooded

        The cool refreshing temperatures and spectacular scenery

        hidden as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> clouds sweep upwards once again to shroud the peak in

        At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13,450 ft</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunung Kinabalu</ENAMEX> is the high peak

        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, though <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only one and a half hours</TIMEX> on return. There are also
        regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> plying the highway between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandakan</ENAMEX>. The journey

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clothing</ENAMEX>, too, for those climbing the mountain.
        The climb to the summit is largely open to anyone in good
        condition and ready to make the effort. Except for extra-warm clothing
        and good walking shoes, special mountain-climbing gear is not required.

        do climb to the summit are rewarded with a magnificent sunrise over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Borneo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> a certificate to prove it.
        It is necessary to book at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park</ENAMEX>

        an overnight stay at a chalet at the point where the climb begins. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX> offers a good restaurant and a wide range of accommodation, from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chalets</ENAMEX> to simple hostels. At the park‚Äôs headquarters arrangements are
        made for your mountain guide, porters, and transport to the station
        where the climb begins. There are multimedia and slide shows, and trail
        maps are available for those who want to set out on their own (but be
        careful, as some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> are not as well marked as others). Those with a
        hardy constitution may like to swim in the cool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liwago River</ENAMEX> nearby. A
        small but comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mountain Garden</ENAMEX> provides a good introduction to

        But the most fascinating remain the pink-speckled, carnivorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>. Look out, too, for the bracket <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX>, growing out of tree

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kinabatangan River Basin</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kinabatangan Basin</ENAMEX>, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of
        Sandakan, offers a good opportunity to catch sight of a range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wildlife</ENAMEX>, especially hornbills, monitor lizards, macaques, and
        orang-utans, not to mention the elusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">proboscis monkey</ENAMEX> or the rare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhinoceros</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinabatangan</ENAMEX> is a rewarding river for

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandakan</ENAMEX>.
        Another access point to the wilds of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX> is through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danum Valley Conservation Area</ENAMEX>. The valley is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles)‚</NUMEX>Äàinland
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lahad Datu</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sabah‚Äôs east</ENAMEX> coast. Here are a range of walking
        trails through the protected <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, home to the western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tarsier</ENAMEX>,
        orang-utan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">leopard cat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malayan</ENAMEX> sun bear, smooth otter, and

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sepilok Orang-Utan Sanctuary</ENAMEX>
        A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> drive west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandakan</ENAMEX>, this nature reserve
        provides a rehabilitation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orang-utans</ENAMEX>, previously held
        in captivity, to prepare them to be able to live in the forest unaided.
        Boardwalk <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> and muddy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> through the forest to
        the feeding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
        These highly theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">russet-furred</ENAMEX> apes (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>)
        exist at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sepilok‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rainforest: tame, entirely in the
        care of the zoologists; semi-tame, living within reach of the
        sanctuary‚Äôs feeding points; and wild, having moved off to the remote
        parts of the forest away from their prying human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX>. Many of the
        orang-utans are as curious as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. They have flashy tastes,
        preferring to snatch at bright objects rather than dull ones. They have
        a good sense of parody. Watching someone put up an umbrella in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rain</ENAMEX>, they will immediately mimic this, using leaves and twigs. And
        they show a weary disdain for the antics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> leaping
        around them.
        Optimistic figures put the numbers of orang-utans at
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000 and 20,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX>, mostly living in swampy forest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. While still free from being listed as endangered, fears are
        nevertheless held that unbridled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX>-cutting could sharply reduce
        their numbers.

        Until the development of the new international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KL</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> flew into or out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> on their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> trip,
        staying over most notably for the duty-free shopping. Although
        Singapore‚Äôs recent economic growth has led to higher prices, the
        quality and variety of goods remain big draws. But shopping has been
        superceded by travelers‚Äô interest in experiencing its cosmopolitan

        Land is still being reclaimed from the sea and coastal

        colonial origins as a trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> boasts the world‚Äôs
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>-busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, as containers are brought from the region to be
        reloaded for new destinations. Banking and stock trading have made
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> a key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in the international financial markets and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prime</ENAMEX> location for raising capital. On top of this, its economy
        sustains thriving machinery and sophisticated electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX>.
        Asia‚Äôs recent economic crisis has slowed things down, but international
        demand for electronics promises to be a key to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore‚</ENAMEX>Äôs revival. Its
        duty-free retail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, especially imported cameras, computers,
        and jewelry, lead many to think of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore City</ENAMEX> as one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> shopping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mall</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX>).

        city‚Äôs major neighborhoods. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> main areas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> worthy of

        Chinatown
        What was once the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Singapore‚Äôs Chinese</ENAMEX> community
        is now being encroached upon by new development, as the rising
        skyscrapers of the financial district cast their ever-widening shadows
        on the shophouses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Bridge Road</ENAMEX>. More recently, efforts have
        been made at restoration rather than destruction, but the old groceries
        and apothecaries are still threatened by rising rents. But not all is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lost‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyet</ENAMEX>. You can wander around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> of live eels, gnarled ginger
        root, decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanterns</ENAMEX>, and freshly slaughtered python <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> abound. Among the most well known is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San See Temple</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Race Course Road</ENAMEX>, dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of mercy,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuan Yin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thain Hock Keng Temple</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Telok Ayer Street</ENAMEX>, dates back
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX> when a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the site was dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX>; the temple‚Äôs construction was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1839</TIMEX>.
        The most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sri Mariamman</ENAMEX>, the oldest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on the island, practically founded with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> itself
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 19th century</TIMEX>. Inside its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gopuram</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>)
        profusely decorated with statues, you will find the temple‚Äôs presiding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">goddess</ENAMEX>. She won allegiance for her cures for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">smallpox</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cholera</ENAMEX>
        that were prevalent when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> was established. Next door is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chulia Mosque</ENAMEX>.
        Little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>
        Little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> is centered around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serangoon Road</ENAMEX>, and
        besides the myriad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and loud music, you will also find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
        and temples. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most interesting is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sri</ENAMEX> Veeramakaliamman
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kali</ENAMEX>, whose origins go back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1880s</TIMEX>,
        though the roof carvings of the goddess‚Äôs many manifestations have only
        been in place for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three decades</TIMEX>. Worship here tends to be noisy and
        theatrical.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thandayuthapani Temple on Tank Road</ENAMEX> is scene for the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Thaipusam Festival</ENAMEX> that is marked throughout the peninsula by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devotees</ENAMEX> express their faith by piercing their

        Singapore‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> are a rich mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> and

        neighborhood, specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Bridge Road</ENAMEX>, has much of the
        atmosphere of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eastern</ENAMEX> bazaar, with aromas very different than

        Gardens

        construction, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> has covered its island with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and gardens.

        as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1836</TIMEX>, when a voluntary society hoped to build on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> failed

        succeeded, originally as a nursery for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> seedlings that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">launched Malaysia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rubber industry (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> aging <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> here
