        the Egyptians
        E gypt‚Äôs long and illustrious history seems to hold the
        modern world spellbound. The ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> that flourished here from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX> b.c. until just before the dawn of Christianity was, arguably, the
        greatest civilization that the world has ever seen. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two hundred years</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> sent his army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to explore the land and
        bring back the first hand-drawn impressions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-buried statues and
        columns, the world couldn‚Äôt get enough. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Carter</ENAMEX> peered
        through the dusty air of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tutankhamun‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX> and, in his own
        words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwonderful things‚Äù</ENAMEX> met his eyes, he confirmed the immeasurable
        wealth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharaohs</ENAMEX>, and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backer</ENAMEX> of the dig, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carnarvon</ENAMEX>,
        died suddenly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few months later</TIMEX>, vox populi blamed it on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pharaohs mummy‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> was quick to feed our
        fantasies. Today, ‚Äúpseudo-scientific‚Äù theories about the origin and
        purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> fill the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> of bookshops and the listings
        on documentary channels. Our interest and curiosity about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> is, it
        seems, insatiable.
        Due to this unprecedented attention, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>
        with preconceived ideas, in addition to a sense of excitement and
        anticipation. But when it comes to the reality of the archaeological
        sites, nothing prepares you for their beauty, scale, and magnificence.
        The colossal statues are overwhelming, the delicate grace of the tomb
        paintings breathtaking, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids prodigious</ENAMEX>, and the huge temple
        complexes positively <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herculean</ENAMEX>. One can see how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> arrive
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one season</TIMEX> and never leave‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe ruins</ENAMEX> and artifacts, like the
        enigmatic smile of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphinx</ENAMEX>, pose more questions than we have
        answers.
        There‚Äôs no doubt that the mysteries of the ancient are the
        lure that attracts most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, yet there is much to be said of
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Egypt‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe archaeological sites</ENAMEX> do not sit in a geographical or
        cultural vacuum.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty-first century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> is a land of contrasts, but
        some things never change. Just as in ancient times, without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">River</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> could not exist. The longest river in the world brings
        abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> to irrigate a narrow verdant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley</ENAMEX> snaking its way through the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of square
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kilometers</ENAMEX> of parched desert that constitute the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. Its flow
        is <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">constant‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnever suffocated</ENAMEX> by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-pervading <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> or evaporated
        by the oppressive heat of the sun. All along its length, small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>
        of modest mud-brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> sit surrounded by verdant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll see
        gaggles of geese and ducks waddling along the riverbanks, burdened
        donkeys treading steadfastly homeward, and oxen compliantly tilling the
        fields.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> give thanks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX>, but they
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">worship Allah</ENAMEX>, and the haunting intonations of the muezzin drift across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and farmland calling the faithful to prayer. It is, however, the
        most liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> with a constitution and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">judiciary</ENAMEX> based on western democratic models, not shariah <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> law.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> also has a small but well-integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> community
        who worship the tenets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Mark</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copts</ENAMEX>, as they are known, have
        brought forth many influential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boutros Boutros</ENAMEX>
        Ghali, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary General</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>.
        These interesting amalgams help to make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> such a
        fascinating destination to visit. So many seemingly contrary and
        opposing factors combine to make it unique. Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of its land
        is uninhabited, contrasting with great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, including
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>, which is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Africa‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇa dusty,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noisy</ENAMEX>, sprawling, neon-lit, crowded metropolis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than fourteen</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The majority of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is urban <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX>, yet
        it has family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedouin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nomads</ENAMEX> who spend their
        entire lives in their barren desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>. Office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> function
        by the tick of the clock, watching the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> pass, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> live
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>, marking time with the twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> harvests. Though most
        of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> claim descent from the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egyptians</ENAMEX>, modern
        religious practices and social protocols are totally divorced from
        those of their ancestors. In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where tradition plays an
        overriding part of everyday life, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of its energy comes from
        the ultra-modern source of hydroelectricity.
        It may be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egypt‚Äôs</ENAMEX> position at the meeting point of three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cultures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇAfrica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthat</ENAMEX> accounts for its
        complexity. It has long been influenced by their differing traits, and
        has assimilated their various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX> and practices. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> gold
        brought wealth in ancient times, and the darker skinned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nubians</ENAMEX> became
        invaluable trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> to the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egyptians</ENAMEX>; living around
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aswan</ENAMEX> in the south, they remain close to their roots and their strong
        musical traditions. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> from the east they
        brought a new religion, art, and society that swept away much of what
        had come before. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th and 19th centuries</TIMEX> the Europeans
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arrived‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇone</ENAMEX> legacy of which is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and French spoken by a
        good number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native Egyptians‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand the khedives of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> stole their
        ideas on administration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> to help them run the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thebes</ENAMEX>, is the focus of today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. It was the
        pre-eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> era and the historic legacy of
        that time is a district of medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> architecture unrivaled
        anywhere in the world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powerhouse</ENAMEX> of the modern economy, it is the
        city‚Äôs role as a venue for peace talks, a focus for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>
        of the near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX>, and home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab Council</ENAMEX> that is invaluable in
        these diplomatically uncertain times.
        But tourism is the country‚Äôs modern lifeblood, and not just
        as a result of our insatiable thirst for history. The seas that lap
        Egypt‚Äôs arid shores hide pristine marine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ecosystems</ENAMEX> that have lured
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scuba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> from the inception of the sport. Package <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> soon
        followed and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the coastline of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> is turning into a year-round
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">playground</ENAMEX>. With <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> temperatures rarely dropping below the high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sixties</ENAMEX> and almost continuous sunshine, it makes a welcome retreat from
        the drab northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX>, and a scorching alternative to
        temperate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have been quick to respond, allowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to develop‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthough care must be taken not
        to blight the delicate environment in the rush to turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúEuroland.</ENAMEX> ‚Äù
        Not everything in the garden is rosy of course. With
        poverty and unemployment rising along with foreign debt, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX> spurning negotiation and resorting to violence, Hosny
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX>, the nation‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, has enormous problems to
        solve. But with a foot in so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">camps‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpast</ENAMEX> and present, east and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">west</ENAMEX>, religious and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">secular‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇEgypt</ENAMEX> should be well-placed to withstand
        the vagaries of modern life and grow in wealth and influence in the
        coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharaohs</ENAMEX> has many more eras of history
        to add yet.
