        Sports
        Regardless of the time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> you visit these islands,
        you‚Äôll spend most of your time outdoors, on or near the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and a
        word of caution is necessary. The rays of the tropical sun here can
        cause serious trouble. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 15</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>, fair skin can
        be painfully broiled, even in the shade of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">coconut tree</ENAMEX>. For the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few days</TIMEX> you‚Äôd be well advised to take the sun in extremely small
        doses.
        Swimming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coral</ENAMEX> or volcanic, eggshell white or ashy gray, the sand of
        FWI beaches varies from cove to cove. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> may be on an
        outstanding beach. If not, there‚Äôs usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> within easy reach. In
        Guadeloupe, the best beaches are on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grande-Terre</ENAMEX>, as are most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX> features both dark volcanic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> in the region of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Soufri√®re</ENAMEX> and beige beaches in the north. Local lore says that you
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tan</ENAMEX> better on black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>.
        Martinique‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Pel√©e</ENAMEX> provides the dark coloring for its
        northern beaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Martin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Barth√©lemy</ENAMEX>, though also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">volcanic</ENAMEX> in formation but without erupting peaks, have only light sand
        beaches.
        Swimming conditions vary enormously on all the islands.
        You‚Äôll have no trouble in identifying the many perfectly safe,
        protected shores where hardly a ripple disturbs the surface. Otherwise,
        there are some beaches or sections of beaches where swimming is less
        recommended or even dangerous for all except <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>. Coral reefs often
        reduce wave strength but may not stem very strong ocean currents,
        particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> is also a factor, the winter
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> bringing heavier seas. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique the Tourist Office</ENAMEX> advises
        that the safest beaches for poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">swimmers</ENAMEX> are at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sainte</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX>,
        Trois-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ilets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sainte</ENAMEX>-Luce, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinit√©</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbet</ENAMEX>.
        Good tidings about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX> situation: no incident
        involving a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">swimmer</ENAMEX>, snorkeler, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diver</ENAMEX> has been reported anywhere in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX>. Guadeloupe, incredibly, almost never sees a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX> anywhere
        near its coast. Sightings close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> are very rare and not
        much more frequent off the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, swimming after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dusk</ENAMEX> is not advisable.
        For a small fee, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> may use the beach and facilities
        at a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> hotels‚Äîa great convenience for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>-hoppers. Alternatively, there are also fine public beaches, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">they‚Äôre</ENAMEX> often deserted.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, for those who may be
        allergic to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>.
        Snorkeling, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skin Diving</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scuba Diving</ENAMEX>
        Underwater sports off the major islands and rocky islets of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> are the highlights of countless vacations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkeling</ENAMEX> equipment
        may be provided free, rented, or bought inexpensively in tourist areas,
        so there‚Äôs no need to bring any from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beginners</ENAMEX> who can stay
        afloat can learn to breathe through the tube and peer through the mask
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>.
        Many of the best snorkeling and underwater photography
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> are offshore at coral reefs or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around uninhabited</NUMEX> islands; you‚Äôll
        have little difficulty in finding a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to take you out. Such
        multicolored reef <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> as the parrotfish and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">angelfish</ENAMEX>,
        along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weirdly</ENAMEX> shaped coral, crawfish, or turtles hiding in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crevices</ENAMEX>, can be yours for the viewing in these clear waters where
        visibility of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 ft</ENAMEX>) is common.
        Free-dive spear fishing (without air container) is
        permitted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX>, but always check with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> before
        eating anything you catch (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX>). You should see many of the
        following: grouper, amberjack, red or rock hind, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stingrays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rays</ENAMEX>, and moray eels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equipment</ENAMEX> may be rented at watersports
        establishments.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scuba</ENAMEX> (an acronym for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-Contained Underwater Breathing</ENAMEX>
        Apparatus) is taught and offered at major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. This ultimate
        subsurface experience is becoming very popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, as it has
        been for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a number of years</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transparency</ENAMEX> and teeming underwater life make it ideal for scuba, and
        since the water stays <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tropically</ENAMEX> warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX> you shouldn‚Äôt need a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full wetsuit</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boating</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Windsurfing</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water-Skiing</ENAMEX>
        A large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> have small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>
        available for rent, including the always popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sunfish</ENAMEX>. You can also
        find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> to give sailing lessons, as well as all kinds of boat
        excursions on which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skipper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> do the work while you relax.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windsurfing</ENAMEX> is making a splash in the FWI: you‚Äôll see the
        colorful sails, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX>, and masts all around the islands. It looks
        easier than it is: you‚Äôll need lessons, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two or three</NUMEX>, just to
        get you started.
        Water-skiing is somewhat harder to find, but certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>
        do provide motorboats and skis with fixed rates for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> tour
        and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional</NUMEX> fee per lesson. The more tours you buy, the lower the
        rate, so water-ski <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> will certainly get value for money.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sailing and Yachting</ENAMEX>
        With balmy trade winds, infrequent squalls, and flowing sea
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">currents</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> and nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX> are ideal for a day, a week, or a
        month under sail. As every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islander</ENAMEX> knows, many of the most gorgeous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coves</ENAMEX> and beaches are reachable only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. For a fairly modest sum
        per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, you might consider chartering a skippered sloop or
        catamaran for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full day</TIMEX>.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique</ENAMEX>, the popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-day or two-week</TIMEX> sail takes
        you to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX> and down into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grenadines</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>, try <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saintes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Galante</ENAMEX>, which both have safe anchorages or sail
        further to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antigua</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-ft) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-masted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> sleeping a maximum
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> can be taken from either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Guadeloupe‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfor</ENAMEX> a small fortune, of course.
        To do it yourself, or charter ‚Äúbareboat,‚Äù you‚Äôll need to
        demonstrate proficiency. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find various <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> for charter at the
        yachting car√©nage in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, or across its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bay</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-du-Bout marina</ENAMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint-Martin‚Äôs Marigot</ENAMEX>. During
        the peak <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-December to mid-April</TIMEX>) rates are higher.
        Among the yachts advertised for charter in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> is a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX>-ft) ketch built for the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farouk</ENAMEX>.
        Fishing
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> are somewhat removed from the great game-fishing
        waters off the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>, but the
        average angler will find challenges aplenty here from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or shore.
        There are a limited number of deep-sea <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> for charter; they normally
        accommodate up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> might also agree to take
        you out in their time-tested, no-frills <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. This may mean you‚Äôll
        have to help with nets or traps, an instructive experience.
        Surfcasting with lures (called spinning), is outstanding at
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> points in southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Martinique</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Ferr√©</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap Macr√©</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cap</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevalier</ENAMEX>. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> say it‚Äôs also excellent at llet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pointe</ENAMEX>
        Baham, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand-Rivi√®re</ENAMEX>. Expect to haul in jacks, barracuda,
        yellowtail snapper, tarpon (best with bait off Vauclin), dolphin, red
        hind, and jewfish.
        Bottom fishing may get you grouper, tarpon, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mahogany</ENAMEX> or red
        snapper, parrotfish, grunts, and, rarely, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pompano</ENAMEX>. In
        Martinique the best bottom fishing is probably at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Robert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salines</ENAMEX>.
        Guadeloupe, with more fully equipped ocean-going <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> than
        Martinique, offers deep-sea fishing for kingfish, tuna barracuda,
        bonito, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">dolphin</ENAMEX>. You should find some or all of these in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Martin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> as well, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> available for
        charter. Wahoo, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbig five‚Äù game fish</ENAMEX>, is hooked occasionally
        off all the islands.
        Before frying up your catch, remember to check with local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> about edibility (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A few long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fairway</ENAMEX> shots away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Josephine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX>

        only a short ride (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21‚ÅÑ2 km/11‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-du-Bout</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>,
        some of which have special package arrangements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">prolific American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfing architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Trent Jones</ENAMEX>, Sr. , designed
        this rolling <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,072-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,640-yard</NUMEX>) course, a factor ensuring it‚Äôs not
        easy to play. It‚Äôs generally windy here, and there are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight</NUMEX> water
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">holes</ENAMEX> (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort-de-France bay</ENAMEX>). Guadeloupe‚Äôs course,
        also by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Fran√ßois</ENAMEX>, is relatively flat, but the winds
        here make it quite ‚Äúinteresting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Golf</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> is offered only
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> side of the island.
        Greens fees are constant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round. Material for hire
        includes electric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and pull <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX>. Or you can engage a caddy; it‚Äôs
        always pleasant to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennis</ENAMEX>
        You will be able to play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> at all of
        Guadeloupe‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX>, at most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Martin‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, and at some of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinique‚Äôs</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> may also use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> private clubs‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇTennis

        very expensive during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and exorbitant under lights. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rackets</ENAMEX> may
        be rented. Surfaces are artificial. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Professionals</ENAMEX> give lessons at many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, the price sometimes included in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>-package vacations. Until

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horseback Riding</ENAMEX>
        There are several stables on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> can

        Guadeloupe‚Äôs huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Park</ENAMEX> has trails laid out through

        If you‚Äôre not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, think <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. Particularly on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>, where the outstanding bargains are in
        perfumes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> fashions, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>, and other luxury items from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. On duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Martin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Barth√©lemy</ENAMEX>, the range of
        best buys is even greater. There are local handicraft items for sale on

        off the obvious tourist beat, and don‚Äôt hesitate to bargain.
        At hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, prices may or may not be the same as in

        holidays when cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Better <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are
        air-conditioned.
        All of the islands accept <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Canadian dollars</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> as readily <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as French francs</NUMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> and
        Martinique give discounts (usually <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX>) for purchases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traveler‚Äôs</ENAMEX> checks, but not if you pay in foreign currency. On
        Martinique you‚Äôre likely to get the same discount if you pay with one
        of the major credit cards.
        Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinique</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> enjoy duty-free status
        (apart from the duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>), but almost everything
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is sold at mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> prices, well below what the
        items would cost in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> returning home must pay <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> duty on
        everything above <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600</NUMEX> worth of purchases made abroad, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> customs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">levy</ENAMEX> added to the price of an item may still come to less than what the
        purchases would cost in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>. Any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goods</ENAMEX> shipped back from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> require a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> duty regardless of the monetary value. (It is illegal
        to ship alcoholic beverages. )
        A wise idea is to price major items at home before your
        vacation. To avoid possible complications with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, veteran
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> ask for and retain a receipt (sales slip) for everything
        purchased.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe‚Äôs Shopping Scene</ENAMEX>
        Aside from a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> around
        the island, notably in or near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, interesting shopping is
        concentrated in an area of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX> several city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks square</ENAMEX>,
        beginning at the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> dock.
        Best buys: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> perfumes, silk items, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, crystal
        liqueurs, and vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>.
        Good buys: cloth hangings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> scenes, seashell
        jewelry, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw mats</ENAMEX> and hats, particularly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Barth√©lemy</ENAMEX>, local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rum</ENAMEX>, and conch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX> (beautiful specimens can be had for just a few
        francs apiece from curbside peddlers near the maritime terminal, but
        only when a cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> is about to depart).
        A standard Guadeloupe souvenir is a puffed-up,
        porcupine-spined puffer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> (poisson <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>), which, if large enough,
        can become an offbeat lamp shade. You should also see items crafted
        from shark‚Äôs teeth and occasionally even entire jaws.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique‚Äôs Shopping Scene</ENAMEX>
        Much of downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort- de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is fertile territory for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-du-Bout</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worth taking the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> ferry ride to the capital to investigate prices there before
        shopping at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotel boutiques</ENAMEX>. Elsewhere on the island there
        are a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft workshops</ENAMEX>.
        Best buys: perfumes and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> luxury items as listed
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>; you‚Äôll also find neckties and the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> silk
        scarves on sale at reasonable prices (which incorporates a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX>
        traveler‚Äôs check discount).
        Good buys: the island‚Äôs typical poup√©e martiniquaise, a
        doll in madras <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> costume on sale everywhere; tapestries, wicker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trays</ENAMEX>, and boxes, and the memorable dark (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged</TIMEX>) or white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>.
        Before buying anthuriums or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, check your
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re-entry</ENAMEX> regulations at home.
        Facing the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> waterfront is
        an outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> where you might try bargaining for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX> hats and
        baskets, conch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shells</ENAMEX>, huge wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forks</ENAMEX>, or seashell necklaces. Some
        of the salesladies at this colorful, soft-sell market wear traditional
        Martinique costumes. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort-de-France‚Äôs</ENAMEX> main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>,
        tourist-oriented or not, are between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savane</ENAMEX> and the Levassor
        River.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Shops</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> stock a selection of mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haitian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> jewelry. Watch for onyx from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage pendants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uruguay</ENAMEX>, among other exotic
        items.
        Duty-Free <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delights</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Martin and Saint-Barth√</ENAMEX>©lemy
        For many items, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small northern islands have the
        lowest prices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the ‚Äúduty-free‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> nearby even do their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas shopping</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philipsburg</ENAMEX>,
        Marigot, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gustavia</ENAMEX>. It takes a while to realize that not just certain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, but every store on these islands sells at the same taxless,
        duty-free prices.
        Almost everything is quoted in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US dollars</NUMEX>, but, of course,
        you can pay in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">French francs</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands Antilles</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">guilders</NUMEX>. While
        prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> perfumes and fashions may not be appreciably lower
        here than in the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX>, they could be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
        would pay at home.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three little</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, shopping begins where the
        boats come in. There are also a few small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand</ENAMEX>-Case.
        Best buys on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> and to a lesser extent on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Barts</ENAMEX> include: perfumes and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cosmetics</ENAMEX>, luggage, fashions, fabrics
        including madras, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>, leather, figurines, and children‚Äôs
        clothes.
        Savor the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX>-style a tmosphere of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marina Port</ENAMEX>

        At the busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front Street</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philipsburg</ENAMEX>, you can buy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Delft</ENAMEX> blue, jewels, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">silks</ENAMEX>, linens, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Peruvian</ENAMEX> mirrors, old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquor</ENAMEX>.
        Not everything is automatically a bargain: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> may find that certain calculators and cameras, for example,
        are just as inexpensive at discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> back home. However, on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Martin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Barts</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll also be saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> or state
        sales tax that may be levied at home.
        Local Culture and Events
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music and Dance</ENAMEX>
        Swaying rhythms are among the most appealing aspects of
        life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> of all ages love to
        dance, you may have to search a bit nowadays to find the gay and
        flirtatious biguine, the romantic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> mazurka or mazouk, the
        sensually suggestive calenda. Like the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, the FWI
        are inundated by the marvelous steel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> calypsos of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX>, the
        merengue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominica</ENAMEX>, and the reggae and rampa‚Äînot to mention North
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> pop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">music‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcourtesy</ENAMEX> of the transistor, and the
        more recently popular craze: zouk.
        The authentic FWI dances originated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">slaves</ENAMEX>. Some are adaptations of those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX>.
        The biguine, immortalized for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Saxons</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole Porter</ENAMEX>, is thought
        to have come first to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Congo</ENAMEX>. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> see dancing it properly have been moving their hips and
        knees that way since childhood. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dixieland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> will notice the
        instrumental similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans‚Äîbanjo</ENAMEX>, clarinet, bass, trombone,
        and drums.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">laghia‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin</ENAMEX> which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, dancing to drums alone,
        simulate a fierce kicking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">combat‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇarrived</ENAMEX> with slaves from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dahomey</ENAMEX>.
        Only in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> during patron saint day festivals or at a folk
        dance performance are you likely to see rose, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave woman‚</ENAMEX>Äôs washing
        dance; grage, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> mimicking tapioca graters to the beat of
        goat-skin drums; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">haute-taille</ENAMEX>, an adaptation with accordion and
        drums of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> quadrille; or the bel-air, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX>
        version of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-figure quadrille.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-five</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> in the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">favorites</ENAMEX>, as do less formal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>. Here you‚Äôll see the
        delightful but slowly disappearing indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FWI costume‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇmadras
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">turban</ENAMEX>, madras skirt over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">petticoat</TIMEX>, silk peplum, white blouse, and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX>
        It may not be the wildest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carnival</ENAMEX> is the longest, by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> there are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pajama</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúdoudou‚Äù</ENAMEX> doll, and pirate parades, plus always-spectacular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carnival</ENAMEX> floats. The riotous revelry roars right past <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mardi Gras</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shrove</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>) when red-costumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children star</ENAMEX> as devils, to its peak

        flooded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diablesses</ENAMEX>, all dressed in black and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> and losing themselves in the biguine. The carnival king, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vaval</ENAMEX>,
        is burned in effigy after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</TIMEX>, but the frenzied dancing goes on till
        after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>.
        Special Events
        Aside from carnival and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> saints‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>,
        you‚Äôll enjoy:
        Fishermen‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√™te des Marins P√™cheurs</ENAMEX>) late in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX>, with parades, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish feasts</ENAMEX>, and traditional
        costumes.
        Cooks‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√™te des Cuisini√®res</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early August</TIMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>, with a colorful, appetite-stimulating parade, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religious</ENAMEX> ceremony honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Laurent</ENAMEX> (chosen as the local cooks‚Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX> because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 258</TIMEX> he was burned alive on a rack, which
        is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen utensil</ENAMEX>) and a monumental free feast with singing,

        All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saints‚Äô Day</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Toussaint</ENAMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 November</TIMEX>, when, after

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Folk Beliefs</ENAMEX>
        Don‚Äôt sleep in the rays of the moon‚Äîyour facial features
        will be distorted. Pour some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> into a dead man‚Äôs mouth to cheer him
        up, otherwise he‚Äôll come back to haunt the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. These and other
        superstitions are held by many FWI <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. Many of the strange twigs,
        herbs, and packets you‚Äôll see in the markets have to do with magic
        based on traditions that stem from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> origins of most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This is not, however, the voodoo of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX>, and there are no
        ‚Äúblack magic‚Äù performances staged for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>.
        Early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> used to say tiens, bois! (here, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>! )
        when they gave <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> to ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX>. It seemed magical when
        maladies were cured, and from tiens, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bois</ENAMEX> derived the word quimbois,
        for magic potion or spell. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> and
        Guadeloupe there are still quimboiseurs who mix the mysterious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concoctions</ENAMEX>. They are considered useful for divining the future,
        prescribing remedies for problems, and perhaps putting a spell on an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>.
        The ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist</ENAMEX> will find it difficult to obtain
        precise details about this magic, which is known as obeah around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>.
        Nightlife
        There‚Äôs little danger that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies</ENAMEX> will ever
        be overrun with ‚Äúswinging‚Äù after-hours <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> is
        making an effort. On its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äúriviera‚Äù</ENAMEX> along the southern coast of
        Grande-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Terre</ENAMEX>, there are a number of private discotheques and rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nightclubs</ENAMEX> in addition to the hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounges</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> are welcome at
        such nightspots, where they‚Äôre likely to be outnumbered by
        rhythm-loving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupeans</ENAMEX>. Advertisements suggest there is striptease
        occasionally in this area, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">logical‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇor illogical</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄÇ ‚Äî‚ÄÇon</ENAMEX> an island
        promoting nudism.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX>, all but the most adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> will
        prefer dancing and drinking in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Here they‚Äôll have the
        latest calypso mixed with more familiar pop and soul. The admission
        charge at hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lounges</ENAMEX> includes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> drink. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and
        its suburbs have a smattering of very local, very crowded discotheques
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> rarely appear. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> reason: most of the island‚Äôs resort
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> are quite a distance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
        If folklore <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>, steel bands, or limbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> visit
        your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> area, they usually perform during dinner, so you just sit
        down and enjoy the show, generally outdoors.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> have a couple of hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>,
        modest and low-key by international standards, but perfectly able to
        accommodate you if you‚Äôd like to risk your next year‚Äôs salary. There is
        a large, bright, new casino in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schoelcher</ENAMEX>, the northern outskirt of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nightly</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9pm until at least 3am</TIMEX>,
        offer roulette, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> blackjack, baccarat, and sometimes craps, and,
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> boule. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drinks</ENAMEX> are available and expensive.
        There‚Äôs an admission charge, you must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 21</NUMEX> to
        enter, and you must present your passport or other official
        identification each time you go. At a slightly disadvantageous rate,
        you can exchange foreign currency or traveler‚Äôs checks for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">franc</NUMEX> chips.
        Succumbing to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>-wide informality, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> do not require
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to wear a tie or jacket.
        If your <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> is good or just needs some polishing, both
        major islands have movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> that show <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> films
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> soundtracks only. Seat prices won‚Äôt ruin you.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX>, lingering over a seaside dinner is the
        preferred after-dark activity on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> side, where most lights go
        out by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10pm</TIMEX>. For livelier <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-nights</TIMEX> spots, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>
        side with its revues and well-publicized hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Barts</ENAMEX>, soon after nightfall, the most popular
        leisure activity is sleep‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇat least out of season. But a bit of
        nightlife is available in the thick of the tourist season.
