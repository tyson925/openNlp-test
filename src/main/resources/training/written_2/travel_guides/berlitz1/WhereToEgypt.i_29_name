        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pyramids</ENAMEX>
        Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">641</TIMEX> and expanded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatimids</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ninth</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cairo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇAl-Qahira</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">‚Äúthe City</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Victory‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX> became one of
        the most powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the world during the Medieval <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>,
        marking a rebirth in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fortunes. Situated where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> valley
        widens to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Delta</ENAMEX>, it is now the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
        with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 14 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs hot, dusty, and
        noisy; its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> often at gridlock; its public transport system for the
        most part in chaos. However, once you accept these facts, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> has
        lots to offer the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>; its main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is an essential part of your
        vacation experience and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> life is a sure sign that you have
        come to a totally different culture.
        Central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>
        Central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> is based around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX>, and several
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and squares where you‚Äôll find most of the international
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tahrir Square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation Square</ENAMEX>) on the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> is its
        heart, a mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> converging on the biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> terminus in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which is bounded by government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministries</ENAMEX> and office blocks
        housing airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Nearby on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the
        river is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile Hilton Hotel‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa landmark</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cairenes</ENAMEX> (as the people
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> are known) as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Leading east from the
        square is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kasr El-Nil Street</ENAMEX> lined with western-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ramses Square</ENAMEX> plays host to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railway</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Station</ENAMEX>, designed in the heyday of colonialism and fronted by a
        monumental granite statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ramses II</ENAMEX> transported from the ancient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX> capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>.
        Out in the river are several islands and the largest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>,
        Gezira, is home to one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cairo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most chic neighborhoods, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zamalek</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a number of things to do here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gezira Sporting Club</ENAMEX> has
        a range of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that you can enjoy as a temporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, but if
        you don‚Äôt feel sporty try <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">music‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opera</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> is here sharing a complex with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Art Museum</ENAMEX>. Finally,
        you can get an excellent view of the cityscape from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> Tower
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El-Borg</ENAMEX>), designed like a minaret, though it does stand significantly
        higher at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">182 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">600 ft</ENAMEX>) above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of Gezira</ENAMEX> is Roda
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>, home to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manial Palace</ENAMEX>, now converted into an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nileometer</ENAMEX> is also situated here. Built in a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">715</NUMEX> to help measure the
        peak and trough of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX> flood. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> now no longer needed as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aswan High Dam</ENAMEX> in the far south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> completely controls the flow,
        keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> safe.
        The west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX> is home to the modern university
        and seemingly endless residential suburbs, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> attractions lie on
        or close to the river. In the north, opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gezira Island</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian National Circus</ENAMEX>, a Soviet-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX>, performs nightly
        except in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Further south, set among verdant gardens, is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo Zoo</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian Museum</ENAMEX>
        Sitting on the north side of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tahrir Square</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>. Founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auguste Mariette</ENAMEX> in an attempt to stop the flow of artifacts to museums
        around the world, it has grown into one of the major collections in the
        world, housing some of the finest treasures of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        civilization. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is a little dated, confusing, and often
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">crowded‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe best time to visit is at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX> when most large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are having <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lunch‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 120,000</NUMEX> pieces on display, all
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000 and 1,400</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>, it is a must-see attraction during
        your visit. The artifacts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> come from archaeological sites
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and they will add a great deal to your understanding
        and appreciation of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. Allow at least <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visit‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> comprehensive tour will take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX>. ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ The best
        strategy is to schedule <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> visits into your itinerary, both before and
        after your trips to the temples and other historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> along the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX>.
        The artifacts that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> put at the top of their
        lists are on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, so you may want to head there first
        before you get worn out. Several recently refurbished <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> display
        over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tutankhamun</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Carter</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>. The only undisturbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX> tomb ever to be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX>, it captured the public imagination and fired peoples‚Äô desire
        to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 19</NUMEX> when he died and there was little
        time to prepare a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> more suitable for royalty, but it was
        still filled with treasures for use when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> arrived at the Other
        World. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> following his interment, the tomb entrance became
        covered with debris when another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> was dug nearby, saving it from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tomb robbers</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> coffins surrounding the king‚Äôs mummy are on display
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">museum‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> inner one is fashioned from pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and weighs
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">170 kg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">374 lbs</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚</ENAMEX>Äôs gold funerary mask can also be seen, a
        truly awe-inspiring find which still dazzles the eye even after over
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3,000 years</TIMEX>.
        Also upstairs is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mummy Room</ENAMEX> where you can find the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preserved</ENAMEX> remains of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egypt‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most illustrious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>. These
        mainly date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th</TIMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasties</ENAMEX> and include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses IV</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutmosis III</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutankhamun</ENAMEX> could have been among
        them, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> made the decision to return him to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX> and he now rests once again in the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>
        of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> in a stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sarcophagus</ENAMEX>.
        The ground floor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> follow the chronological history of
        ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> starting on the left of the entrance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Kingdom</ENAMEX>
        Room. The finds are mainly tomb artifacts found at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and you can view the exact re-creation of a funerary chamber
        found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dahshur</ENAMEX> to familiarize yourself with what you will see later
        in your vacation along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Valley</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Egypt</ENAMEX>.
        Tomb artifacts give us a great deal of information about
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. There are delightful wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> made as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> for the dead. These included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> and boat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. Important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re-created</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> to make sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> would be provided for in
        his afterlife.
        Room <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> is devoted to the so-called heretic period of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX> history when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahkenaten</ENAMEX> established a religion based on only
        one god and founded a capital at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tell al Amarna</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. The
        experiment lasted only until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahkenaten‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death when almost all records
        relating to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> were destroyed. All the artifacts here were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">excavated at Tell al Amarna</ENAMEX> including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> giant statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaoh</ENAMEX>
        with his distinctive long chin and rounded belly.
        Among this amazing range of exquisite and colorful finds,
        there are also important artifacts that help confirm certain
        archaeological theories about the chronology of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> history such
        as the slate palate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Narmer‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇone</ENAMEX> of the first documents scribed
        after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> became a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statuary</ENAMEX> found all around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> depicts both the
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">deities‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇOsiris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hathor, Isis</ENAMEX> and others‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharaohs</ENAMEX>
        of the major dynasties. Huge representations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses II</ENAMEX>
        illustrate the power held by the throne and by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX>,
        though there are also tiny sculptures such as a bust of Queen
        Hatschepsut, which may have stood on a mantle or in a niche, showing
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX> were not just fixated by the epic and monumental.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamic Cairo</ENAMEX>
        Though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> has many modern and nondescript suburbs, the
        oldest districts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Al-Qahira</ENAMEX> are well-preserved and exhibit some of
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest</TIMEX> period architecture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world. Founded to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">east</ENAMEX> of the river, it was protected from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">yearly Nile flood</ENAMEX> and
        surrounded by a high wall to guard against invaders.
        The famed marketplace of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cairo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇKhan El-Khalili‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇstill
        buzzes with the atmosphere of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medieval souk</ENAMEX> and it makes a good place
        to start your tour, though do return as the sun drops and the lights
        come on because the atmosphere is palpable. Narrow alleyways brim with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, leather, and alabaster, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are replete with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barrow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> touting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>. It is the largest marketplace in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Near East</ENAMEX>, and it‚Äôs been so for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost one thousand years</TIMEX>. The
        market developed during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fatimid</ENAMEX> period on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>
        that connected the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> gates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bab Zuweila</ENAMEX> in the south and Bab
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El-Futah</ENAMEX> in the north. A series of caravanserais (rooming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">camel caravans</ENAMEX> that were the main method of transporting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goods</ENAMEX>), or
        khans as they were known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Fatimid</ENAMEX> era, were built
        here by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emir El-Khalili</ENAMEX>, giving the market its name. As you stroll
        along its various shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> look for significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monuments</ENAMEX>. Exquisite stone carving, wood turning, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>/brasswork, and
        ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tiling</ENAMEX> are the main features of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> architecture and the
        period <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, mosques (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> of worship), madrasas
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>), khans and bayts (private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>) are very
        impressive.
        Major among these is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalawun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barquq Mosque</ENAMEX> on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">arterial Muizz lidina-Illah Street</ENAMEX>. Dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1293</TIMEX>, its long fa√ßade
        is rich in architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al-Mansur Kalawan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d.1290</ENAMEX>)
        is at the heart of the complex and is surrounded by beautiful screens
        of ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fretwork</ENAMEX>.
        If the striking portal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El-Nasir Mohammed</ENAMEX> madrasa
        next door strikes you as reminiscent of those in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> Gothic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX>, you are not far from the truth. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> was taken as booty
        from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acre</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>) when it was overrun by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barquq Mosque</ENAMEX> is the youngest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, completed in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 14th century</TIMEX>.
        Continue north and then left on A-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darb al-Asfar Street</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bayt es-Suheimi</ENAMEX> on your right. This was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of
        the rector of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El-Ahzar Mosque</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years ago</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX> homes
        centered around a large central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> called a qa‚Äôawith a fountain in
        the middle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">qa‚Äôa</ENAMEX> led to the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. Light was supplied via a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dome</ENAMEX> (schukhsheikha) in the roof as the windows were covered by ornate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wooden</ENAMEX> covers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has been fully restored and offers an
        excellent example of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cairene</ENAMEX> architecture.
        From here it‚Äôs only a short walk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Hakim</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bab El-Futah</ENAMEX> set in a remaining section of the original city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>, dates from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">990</NUMEX> though it was
        renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. The symmetry of the large central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> has
        a simple elegance. Plain outer walls give it the look of a fortress
        more than a place of worship. The huge square gates that flank it are
        more akin to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> since their primary function was to

        Look for the graffiti of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Napoleon‚Äôs French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> on the stone of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towers</ENAMEX>; they spent some time garrisoned at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> and made sure
        they left their marks for posterity.
        The southern boundary of the market is marked by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al-Ghuri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, madrasa (Koranic
        school), and a wikala (an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> word for caravanserai or rooming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>). They were built at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the very beginning of the 16th century</TIMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan al-Ghuri</ENAMEX>, the last Mameluke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> at the
        heart of the development is now a cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> hosting regular
        performances of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whirling Dervishes</ENAMEX> (who achieve religious ecstasy
        by circling around in continuous motion). The wikala, now fully

        local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
        Cairo‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> can be found just east of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al-Ghuri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al-Azhar Mosque</ENAMEX> (meaning ‚ÄúThe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Splendid‚Äù</ENAMEX>) was finished
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">972</NUMEX> though it has been expanded many times over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, and

        From the outset it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of culture and learning, arguably the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> in the world. It is still the foremost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX> studies, attracting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 85,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX>.
        You can walk south along the narrow alleyway cutting the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al-Ghuri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bab Zuweila Gate</ENAMEX>, once the lower entrance to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Huge round bastions topped by ornate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minarets</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al-Muayyad Mosque</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1420</TIMEX>) frame the tiny gate, which was used as a
        permanent scaffold to hang <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> gone by.
        A short stroll west (right) down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ahmed Maher Street</ENAMEX> from
        the gate leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Islamic Art</ENAMEX>, inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX> and
        featuring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> of beautifully crafted objects. Each room
        concentrates on a separate skill revealing excellent examples of carved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and manuscripts. Elaborately decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> are
        also on display. If you intend to take home some souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Islamic</ENAMEX>
        crafts, this is a good place to learn about traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, and patterns.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the market region, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-minute</TIMEX> walk or
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten-minute</TIMEX> taxi ride, is The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al-Qal‚Äôa</ENAMEX>), a massive
        fortification built on high ground in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 13th century</TIMEX> to protect
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX>. Later it became the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of the Mamelukes
        and was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>. The size of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gather away from the noise and dust of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The centerpiece of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX>
        built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1824 and 1857</TIMEX>. The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, it has
        earned the name ‚Äúalabaster mosque‚Äù for its grand interior faced with
        the smooth pale <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. The inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sanctuary hall</ENAMEX> is a truly monumental
        space in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> style, capped with a series of beautifully
        painted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX> sits under the colonnade. Its
        Carrera marble fa√ßade is incised with intricate carvings of traditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX> themes. Next to the elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX> is the
        much simpler <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el-Nasir Mosque</ENAMEX> with a small inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>.
        You‚Äôll be able to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military Museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carriage</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your</TIMEX> tour, but do take time to visit the vantage points
        along the western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> for wonderful views down onto vast areas of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>, left unused and now decaying, and panoramic views across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>.
        The minarets that you see in the foreground belong to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. On the left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrasa of Sultan</ENAMEX>
        Hasan, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1362</TIMEX>. There are in fact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and each one has its own portal and inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. The
        original minaret on the southwest corner is the tallest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">265 ft</ENAMEX>). To the right of the madrasa is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al-Rafai Mosque</ENAMEX>
        completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX> and the last greatest religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> to be built
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It forms the resting places of many lesser <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX>, and is where the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shah</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> was interred
        following his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>.
        A short walk west from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tulun</ENAMEX> founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">876</TIMEX> as the religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of a great military
        compound established by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn Tulun</ENAMEX> who was appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">868</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> is unusual in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> in that it has no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fa√ßade‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit</ENAMEX> is

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gayer-Anderson Museum</ENAMEX> beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibn Tulun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> was
        built as a private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1540</TIMEX> and amalgamated with a neighboring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cretan Woman</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayt al-Kritliya</ENAMEX>) dating

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">museum</ENAMEX> displays the outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> furniture, art,
        and handicrafts collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gayer-Anderson</ENAMEX> during his time in

        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of Christianity a strong churc h‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">south</ENAMEX> of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> has survived to the present day.
        Almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nine percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>.
        To reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Cairo</ENAMEX> take the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nile River Bus</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX>
        near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses Hilton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>; it will drop you at the terminus of Masr
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El-Qadeema</ENAMEX>; or take the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> metro line <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mari Girgis Station</ENAMEX>.
        Enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Cairo</ENAMEX> by the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Gate‚</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> Romans

        foundations date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>. Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Serga Church</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sergius</ENAMEX>) also claims this distinction. It is said to have been built at
        the site where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, and the infant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> took shelter after
        they fled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Saint Barbara</ENAMEX> is
        also worth visiting; it is typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coptic</ENAMEX> in style. Next door is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synagogue Ben-Ezra</ENAMEX>, now no longer used for regular services though the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guardian</ENAMEX> will allow you to look inside if he is available.
        The main attraction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Cairo</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coptic Museum</ENAMEX>.
        Housed in an old byat, it is currently under renovation, but the work
        is mostly on the exterior leaving the wealth of artifacts inside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undisturbed</ENAMEX>. The collection covers all aspects of Coptic art and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">worship</ENAMEX>, from vestments, tapestries, early handwritten bibles, and
        painted icons, to ornate stone niches and wood-carved ceilings taken
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> all across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. The guardians are particularly helpful
        and attentive.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pyramids</ENAMEX>
        Giza
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> have exerted a powerful hold on the
        world since explorers <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> began to explore this ancient land. Were
        they simply tombs for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharaohs</ENAMEX>, or astronomical markers to aid the
        quantifying of time; were they built to concentrate a natural energy
        source, or were they not built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> at all, a sign that an alien
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> visited the earth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>?
        Whatever the latest theory, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pyramids of Giza</ENAMEX> (the most
        well-known) are, without doubt, an amazing sight as you stand before
        them. Their sandstone fa√ßades reflect the sunlight, rose-colored in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, golden in the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, and smoky purple as night
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">falls</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">can‚Äôt</ENAMEX> fail to marvel at the feat of design and organization
        that resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of individual stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> being transported
        to the site and placed precisely one atop another with very little
        error in alignment, all without the aid of power tools or lifting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equipment</ENAMEX>.
        Archaeologists have concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Giza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> were
        built within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few hundred years</TIMEX> of each other by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of the
        same royal family c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2600</TIMEX> b.c. as elaborate tombs designed to foil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX>. The largest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Pyramid of Cheops</ENAMEX> is the
        only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúSeven Wonders of the World‚</ENAMEX>Äù described by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>. It stands <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">137 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">450 ft</ENAMEX>) high and was the tallest
        structure in the world until the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1898</TIMEX>. Originally capped with a smooth layer of limestone it would
        have reflected sunlight like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beacon across the Nile valley</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> could not be more in contrast to the vast exterior. Steep,
        narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> lead to a tiny funerary chamber furnished by a simple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite sarcophagus</ENAMEX>. Look for the ventilation shafts that astronomers
        have proved aligned with major constellations in the skies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyramid of Kephren</ENAMEX> is smaller than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Pyramid</ENAMEX>,
        though its location on slightly higher ground makes it seem taller. Its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> was found to contain a red granite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sarcophagus</ENAMEX>. The
        smallest pyramid, that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykerinus</ENAMEX>, adds a wonderful perspective to
        the panorama, particularly when you align the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> for that
        souvenir photograph. To the south of this are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> smaller, unfinished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pyramids</ENAMEX> thought to be for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykerinus</ENAMEX>.
        These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> now famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharaohs</ENAMEX> were not the only ones laid
        to rest here however. Giza was the site of a royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial ground</ENAMEX> from
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Early Empire</ENAMEX> and the desert landscape is dotted with
        numerous mud brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tombs</ENAMEX> and mastabas (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone tombs</ENAMEX> with flat roofs),
        though they are by no means as impressive as the pyramids
        themselves.
        Standing at the base of the sacred causeway that once
        linked the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nileisthe Sphinx</ENAMEX>, the enigmatic depiction of
        Khephren with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> attached to a lion‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Sphinxes were

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ancient Egyptians</ENAMEX> believed that the monument possessed prophetic powers
        and it still has a mysterious hold on the modern psyche.
        The most recent attraction at the pyramid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is a
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> housing the remains of a solar barque (a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar longboat</ENAMEX>)
        which was found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> was made to carry the spirit of
        Khephren into the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Other World</ENAMEX> after his death.
        You can tour the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> on foot, or take a camel or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horseback</ENAMEX> ride between the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> choose to embark on
        a longer journey on horseback to view the monuments without the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>
        cityscape behind them in the distance.
        Once you‚Äôve seen the real thing, maybe you want to visit
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pharaonic Village</ENAMEX>, a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> recreating life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ancient Egypt</ENAMEX>.
        Colorful temples are presided over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">reed boats</ENAMEX> ply the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waterways</ENAMEX> in this interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> that will certainly help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        understand how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may have lived‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit</ENAMEX> may also help the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.
        There‚Äôs a good re-creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutankhamun‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb at the time of
        its discovery so you can see just what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Carter</ENAMEX> saw in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX> also has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> and children‚Äôs play area.
        Saqqara
        Giza was not the only location where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">built‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthere</ENAMEX> are many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> scattered throughout the western
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">desert‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand it was not the place where pyramid-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> started. To
        see the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and oldest pyramid you must make an hour‚Äôs journey south
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saqqara</ENAMEX> and, following this, on to the ancient capital of
        Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egypt‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇMemphis</ENAMEX>.
        Saqqara was the final resting place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX> and constitutes the largest royal graveyard in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. Pride of
        place at the site is taken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Step Pyramid</ENAMEX> built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
        Imhotep for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Djoser</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">c2670</TIMEX> b.c. The pyramid is made up of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tiers</ENAMEX>, reaching a height of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">196 ft</ENAMEX>). Inside the
        structure a shaft was dug <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">28 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> ft) into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bedrock</ENAMEX> where the
        Djoser‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chamber</ENAMEX> was situated. The pyramid is surrounded by a
        compound designed to mimic the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX>;
        with beams, columns, and bundles of reeds carved onto its fa√ßade.
        Several tombs surrounding the pyramid have extremely fine murals,
        particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mereruka‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2300 b.c.</ENAMEX> ), the largest yet discovered
        at the site, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ti‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb with murals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. The mastaba
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Idut</ENAMEX> has exceptional nautical scenes and you‚Äôll also catch
        sight of the name of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tomb robber‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇAhmed the Carpenter‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwho couldn‚</ENAMEX>Äôt
        resist letting the world know about his visit.
        Of the once white walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX>, little remains, but it
        was capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the sixth</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 2200 b.c.</ENAMEX>
        ). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major relics are a monumental statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ramses II</ENAMEX> lying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prostrate</ENAMEX> after losing its feet, and an alabaster sphinx dating from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1400 b.c.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Coast</ENAMEX>
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> leads
        through the fertile lands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Delta</ENAMEX>, past fields of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice</ENAMEX>, and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>. Life seems to have changed
        little in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, though the mud-brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> now have the benefit
        of electricity. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> route leads out through the desert to the
        west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> on a new four-lane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> that leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wadi Natrun</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wadi Natrun</ENAMEX> was one of the most important areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> in
        ancient times, primarily because it was the main source of the mineral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">natron</ENAMEX> used in the mummification and glassmaking processes. Coptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christians</ENAMEX> founded an expansive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> for prayer and contemplation
        here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> a.d. when many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monks</ENAMEX> chose to live their
        lives as hermits. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> monasteries developed as a source of protection
        still remain, and each has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, monks‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> and a sturdy high
        wall. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deir Abu Maker</ENAMEX> is the most important, having provided several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coptic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>; nearby is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deir Anba-Baramos</ENAMEX>. Deir
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Es-Suryani</ENAMEX>, as the name suggests, was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monks</ENAMEX> and
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deir Anba Bishoi</ENAMEX>, is of typical design with a tiny

        from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>. Holy mass is said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Coptic</ENAMEX> language
        but an English-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> is available to give you a comprehensive
        guided tour.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Alexandria</ENAMEX>
        Founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> coast
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">322 b.c.</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> was capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ptolemaic</ENAMEX> era.
        It was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and temples, and a place of
        learning, with one of the most renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> in the known world.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Ships</ENAMEX> from around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> docked at the double harbor. The
        harbor‚Äôs entrances were protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pharos Lighthouse</ENAMEX>, one of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wonders of the World</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately all this was lost in a series
        of earthquakes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early centuries of the first millennium</TIMEX> and
        Ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> now rests below the waters of today‚Äôs harbor. Recent
        underwater archaeological excavations have revealed a wealth of stone
        blocks and statuary lying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few feet</NUMEX> below the surface.
        Although ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> sank into the sea, the city
        continued to flourish as a trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. It was the main entry point
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> until the advent of air travel in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 20th century</TIMEX> and
        its contact with a range of international influences made it the most
        cosmopolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 19th</TIMEX> and early 20th
        centuries it was home to numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> ‚Äúex-pats,‚Äù one of whom, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Durrell</ENAMEX>, ‚ÄÇpainted a graphic picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> life
        here. However, the climate changed after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX> coup and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
        though you can still discern the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> feel of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, there is
        no doubt that it is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> sits on a wide bay with the colonial sandstone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> on the waterside making a wonderful panorama as the sun
        begins to drop in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX>. Myriad fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats bob</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, their catches making the short journey across the wide Corniche
        (sea-front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>) to supply the day‚Äôs menus at local seafood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The western end of the bay sweeps round to a headland,
        which is thought to be the location for the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lighthouse</ENAMEX>. Today, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort of Qait Bey</ENAMEX> watches over the
        harbor entrance. It houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Museum</ENAMEX> with a collection of relics
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Naval</ENAMEX> sojourn here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1798</TIMEX>. Just west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> is
        the former royal palace of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ras El-Tin</ENAMEX>, built for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1834</TIMEX>.
        It was here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farouk</ENAMEX> signed his abdication before
        boarding his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX> for exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>.
        You can walk back to the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corniche</ENAMEX>.
        It takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 30 minutes</TIMEX> and is a very pleasant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strollthankstothecoolbreezesthatcomeoffthesea</ENAMEX>. Look for the elaborate
        oriental lines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu El Abbas</ENAMEX> on your right. Rebuilt in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>, it holds the tombs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheikh</ENAMEX> and other nobles.
        Take time to explore the exquisite Moorish stonework and the elegant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domes</ENAMEX> and minaret.
        A small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on the seafront marks the center of town.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Mini-buses</ENAMEX> dart in and out of the traffic to pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and
        there‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a frantic</TIMEX> rush at peak times as everyone tries to leave the
        city at once. Look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cecil Hotel</ENAMEX> on the western end of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">square</ENAMEX>. Once the gathering place of the colonial ‚Äúglitterati,‚Äù it still
        draws <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> for a glimpse of a genteel past.
        Take a right at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> and walk away from the seafront
        past the tram terminus that links eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> with the city
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. Off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Hurriya Street</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Neo-Classical</ENAMEX> fa√ßade of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greco-Roman Museum</ENAMEX> with a fine collection of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, and
        Ptolemaic artifacts found around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and under the waters of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harbor</ENAMEX>, along with many ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> pieces. There is a marble
        statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX>, consort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Cleopatra</ENAMEX>, who spent many
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> here, and a bust of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>, which was carved in his likeness
        after his death.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and surrounded by modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX> lie
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Baths</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> a.d. they played host to
        the highly ranked of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> who would come to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> to
        relax and exchange news while enjoying a soak or a massage. A little
        further southwest are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some second century</TIMEX> a.d. catacombs with tomb
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX> painted to depict Greco-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> themes.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pompey‚Äôs Pillar</ENAMEX> sits only a few minutes‚Äô walk to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southwest</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-m- (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">95-ft-</NUMEX>) high <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Corinthian</ENAMEX> column hewn from red
        granite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> on the site of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Serapis</ENAMEX>. It was
        raised to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diocletian</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> general that now
        gives it its name.
        The ancient library of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> founded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptolemy</ENAMEX> I was
        said to be the greatest collection of manuscripts in the ancient world
        comprising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 70,000</NUMEX> items. Unfortunately it was damaged by fire
        several times and what remained was completely destroyed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">640</NUMEX> during
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> invasion. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> neared its end the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        government sought to revive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of learning and
        recreate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria Library</ENAMEX>. With the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> a new
        high-tech depository has been built on a site on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corniche</ENAMEX>, east of
        the central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> circular design contrasts sharply
        with the dreary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> around it. Clad with gray Aswan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX>, it
        is engraved with letters and graphic inscriptions of cultures and
        societies around the world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> will house <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over four million</NUMEX>
        volumes composed of books, tapes, maps, videos, and discs.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> has no proper beaches but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) to the east is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montazah</ENAMEX>, a resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and sandy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bays</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montazah Palace</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX> as a hunting lodge,
        started the fashion. It is now a smart hotel and casino surrounded by
        beautiful gardens.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Coast</ENAMEX>
        West of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, civilization gives way to empty desert
        except along the coast, where the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1990s</TIMEX> saw a building boom. Where
        only recently there were virgin beaches, now <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile upon mile</NUMEX> of concrete
        vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> line the strand until you reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">El-Alamein</ENAMEX>, a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90-minute</TIMEX> drive along the coast. This tiny desert railway crossing was
        the scene of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the pivotal battles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>
        defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rommel‚Äôs German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>. The military
        cemeteries of both sides engaged in the historical battle now stand as
        a poignant memorial to the death and destruction that took place in the
        heat of the desert. There is also a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> here with uniforms,
        military hardware, and maps illustrating the battle plans and tactics
        of this most grueling theater of war.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Egypt</ENAMEX>
        The land of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Egypt</ENAMEX> sits in the south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
        and it takes its name because it is up-river of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX> area, which are known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Egypt</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper Egypt</ENAMEX> was the
        heartland of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> at the peak of its power and influence, and
        the remains of its ancient cities form one of the most important and
        breathtaking archaeological collections in the world.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley of the Kings</ENAMEX>
        The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX> is one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> forming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tourist</ENAMEX> bases on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Valley</ENAMEX>. Its name in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Arabic‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇEl-Uqsor‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇmeans
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúgods‚Äô palaces‚Äù</ENAMEX> and it indicates the supreme importance of this area to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Egyptians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX> (known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ancient Greeks</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thebes</ENAMEX>)
        was for many centuries the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX> and religious focal point of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>.
        The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> sits on the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 800</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>. Thebes reached it peak in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Kingdom</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">era</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c.1540‚Äì1100 b.c.</ENAMEX> ). By the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX> arrived it was already
        in decline, having lost influence when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assyrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raiders</ENAMEX> seized control
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX> b.c. and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ptolemaic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> made their base
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c. In the following centuries
        sand swept through the area burying many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> was erected atop this sandy layer and many treasures are still
        lost below the surface of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last hundred years</TIMEX>
        Luxor‚Äôs major historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> have been cleared of sand allowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to now view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple structures</ENAMEX>. Across the river on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">west</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> are the remains of other temples, and more importantly, the
        burial places of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaohs</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ancient Egypt</ENAMEX>, hidden in a
        slender valley beyond the narrow fertile river plain.
        In the heart of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, set beside the waters of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor Temple</ENAMEX>, started by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amenophis III</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">18th Dynasty</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.1350 b.c.</ENAMEX> , and embellished by <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ramses II in the 19th Dynasty</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> served a specific purpose, to host <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the New Year</TIMEX> celebration to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">God Amun</ENAMEX> who would be represented in both his positive form, Amun

        The great pylon (grand entranceway with twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>) of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> is fronted by majestic statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and a large granite

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Before heading into the inner sanctum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, stride
        along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ram-Headed Sphinxesthatpointsinthe</ENAMEX> direction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnak Temple</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>)to the north. These were erected by

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu El Haggag</ENAMEX> which was built within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> complex to protect the
        tomb of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mohammed‚</ENAMEX>Äôs brother-in-law. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> were erected on the bed of sand that covered the temple
        and now sit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ft) or so above the excavated floor level. The
        entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> is through a door at the east <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> above the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
        As you move further into the complex look for statues of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Tutankhamun</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, one of only a few depicting the young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy Pharaoh</ENAMEX> to be found at his capital. From the hall, a colonnade
        leads to an immense hypostyle (with columns supporting the roof) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>,
        decorated with double rows of papyrus columns with beautifully
        preserved colors, and on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Amenophis III</ENAMEX>. Elaborate
        carvings on the walls of both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> depict <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amenophis</ENAMEX> making
        offerings to the gods in thanks for his divine power.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Luxor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> does not have a sound and light show but it is
        open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late each evening</TIMEX>, offering you a chance to enjoy the majestic
        remains under floodlights, a very romantic sight to behold.
        Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor Temple</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corniche</ENAMEX>, a
        tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> carrying traffic through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and officially
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El-Nil Street</ENAMEX>. A wide walkway riverside allows you to stroll and
        benches allow for a shady seat. Here, the felucca (<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile sailboat</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> gather, trying to sell an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> or sunset trip on their
        graceful <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile Cruisers</ENAMEX> lie several abreast, disgorging their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> for tours or shopping trips. Horse-drawn carriages ply the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corniche</ENAMEX> offering trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Karnak</ENAMEX>, or a ride back to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>.
        Also on the riverside of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El-Nil Street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mummy Museum</ENAMEX>,
        with an eclectic collection of artifacts and information about the art
        of mummification. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúofficial‚Äù Archaeological Museum of Luxor</ENAMEX> lies a
        little way north. The modern air-conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is well designed,
        with a small number of delightful pieces on display including a
        striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">basalt</ENAMEX> statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaoh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutmosis III</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North of Luxor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu El Haggag</ENAMEX>, is the bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souk</ENAMEX> or market where you‚Äôll find a
        mixture of tourist souvenirs and local products such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">textiles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Browsing</ENAMEX> is difficult as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> are attentive and can be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insistent</ENAMEX>, but you‚Äôll have fun. If you want to buy pottery or
        alabaster, compare prices and quality with goods on sale at the artisan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> on the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> (see page tk) before making a final
        decision.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Karnak</ENAMEX> sits in the northern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the town
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thebes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">No-Amun or ‚Äúthe City of Amun‚</ENAMEX>Äù in ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>) now <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11/2 miles</NUMEX>) from modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luxor</ENAMEX>. Begun during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Kingdom</ENAMEX>, it was
        the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúSt</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter‚Äôs‚Äù</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient</ENAMEX>

        complex was expanded over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the subsequent centuries</TIMEX> with each generation
        adding their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> and monuments. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">excavations</TIMEX>, a cache of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17,000</NUMEX> items dating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era was found. It was finally
        abandoned towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> a.d. when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> looked to a
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of deities.
        The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, the site extends <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 3 sq km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 sq mile</NUMEX>). Standing at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of
        Amun, greatest of all <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Theban gods</ENAMEX>. This monumental construction covers
        a140-<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sq-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,500-sq-ft</NUMEX>) area, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Hypostyle Hall of 122</ENAMEX>
        columns in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> rows, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> ft) high, and is considered one of the
        finest ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        The avenue of the ram-headed sphinxes flanks the route from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> entrance. This was used for ceremonial purposes,
        allowing statues of the gods to be carried to the river for journeys to
        the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Luxor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karnak</ENAMEX> was linked to Luxor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km-</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3/4-mile-</NUMEX>) long avenue decorated with smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX> and flanked by sphinxes, most of which now lies below the
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.
        From the ticket office you enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple complex</ENAMEX> through
        a colossal pylon, one of the most recent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> at the site and the
        largest constructed anywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ptolemaic</ENAMEX> period.
        However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was never finished and lacks the epic reliefs
        (carved images) found at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philae</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denderah</ENAMEX> (see pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70 and 62</TIMEX>).
        Walk through the gateway and you‚Äôll find yourself in an
        immense open space‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe largest temple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. To
        the left is the diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Seti II</ENAMEX>, and further along on the
        right a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses III</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> smaller pylon,
        fronted by statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shields Karnak Temples</ENAMEX> greatest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">architectural masterpiece‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Great Hypostyle Hall</ENAMEX>. Its immense
        columns (the top of each one could accommodate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> standing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>)
        recreate the papyrus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> of the sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> from which all life
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sprang</ENAMEX> (also representing the landscape of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Egypt</ENAMEX>), and they were
        highly decorated and brilliantly painted in their heyday.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX> pylon leads on to the oldest parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>,
        past <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">obelisks</ENAMEX> added at the behest of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pharaoh Seti I</ENAMEX> and Queen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hatshepsut</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Kingdom</ENAMEX> era. The pink <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite ‚Äúneedle‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the
        queen is the tallest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, pointing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> ft) toward the sky. It
        was originally topped by a cap of pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, which reflected the bright
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sunlight</ENAMEX> and acted as a beacon for those who searched from afar for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX>. Look for a simple statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tutankhamun</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy king</ENAMEX>, below
        the needle. He consolidated power at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thebes</ENAMEX> during his short reign.
        Beyond the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple complex</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Karnak stretches</ENAMEX> out over
        the landscape as far as the eye can see, but many of the other remains
        are more difficult to identify. An interesting building towards the
        rear is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Festival Hall of Tutmoses III</ENAMEX>. It recreates in stone the
        field tent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharaoh</ENAMEX> used when on military campaigns, with the
        central row of columns higher than the outer, meant to hold an
        imaginary canvas high above the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the main temple complex you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacred</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake</ENAMEX>, used in ceremonial processions. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it forms the foreground for
        the seated part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sound and Light Show</ENAMEX>. Stop at the giant granite
        scarab on the northwest corner of the lake. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amunophis III</ENAMEX>
        originally commissioned the scarab it was placed at his temple on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">west</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Egyptians</ENAMEX> consider it lucky to walk <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times
        counter-clockwise around the scarab before touching it and making a

        capital as a secret and supposedly safe location for his resting place,
        cut deep into the rock. Numerous other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> followed him, creating a

        decorated than the last.
        Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley of the Kings</ENAMEX> has become popularly known,
        it is not the only ancient attraction on the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX>.
        There are temples, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of other tombs of lesser though
        important mortals such as high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, nobles and highly regarded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artisans</ENAMEX> who worked on the royal tombs. The tombs are known
        collectively as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theban Necropolis</ENAMEX>.
        From the ferry docking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> on the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> to
        the nearby ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> where you can purchase tickets for all the
        separate archaeological sites. From there the road leads directly
        toward the range of low hills that hide the tombs. You‚Äôll pass <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> huge
        sentinel statues <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> ft) high on the river plain facing out
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">towards the Nile</ENAMEX>. These are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colossi of Memnon</ENAMEX>, statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaoh</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amenophis III</ENAMEX> that once guarded the entrance to his temple, which has
        now completely disappeared.
        At the split in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadway</ENAMEX>, a left turn will lead you
        directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> complex of Medinet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habu</ENAMEX>. Often left out of the tour group itinerary, this part of the west
        bank can be much quieter than the better-known attractions, but they
        offer some interesting insights into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> life and some excellent
        remains. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> and royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were buried in a valley separate
        from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX>. The renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nefertari</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ramses II</ENAMEX>, has the most ornate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> (number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>) but it is not
        always accessible.
        Below the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> are the remains of the town
        of the artisans, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deir el-Medina</ENAMEX>. This is the settlement where
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masons</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> who worked on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tombs</ENAMEX> lived. Simple brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> stand row upon row and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeologists</ENAMEX> found a wealth of everyday artifacts from cooking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utensils</ENAMEX> to work tools, painting a vivid picture of the ancients‚Äô
        activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeologists</ENAMEX> also discovered a number of simple tombs
        where the artisans buried their dead. Brightly decorated by their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peers</ENAMEX>, they depict the incumbent in life, at work, or laboring in the
        fields. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb of Sennedjem</ENAMEX> (number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Innerkhau</ENAMEX> (number
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">359</NUMEX>) are worth exploring.
        A right turn at the junction leads along the valley floor
        past the modern artisan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheik Abd el-Gurnah</ENAMEX>, where you will
        be able to buy alabaster and onyx pieces. The simple brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
        faced with ochre and blue stucco, though larger than those at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deir</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el-Medina</ENAMEX> are little changed in style. There are a number of tombs and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> scattered in farmland here; the most prominent is the mortuary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ramses II</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramesseum</ENAMEX>. Built to hold festivities during
        his visits from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thebes</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramesseum</ENAMEX> was decorated with majestic
        statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaoh</ENAMEX>, and the pylon depicts him triumphant at the
        Battle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qadesh</ENAMEX> when he quashed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hittites</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, much of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> lies in ruins.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tombs of the Nobles</ENAMEX> sit between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramesseum</ENAMEX> and the
        village. The best of these date back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">18th Dynasty</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        art and creativity were at their peak. Take time to explore number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb of Nacht</ENAMEX>, a temple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">astronomer</ENAMEX>. The paintings that cover the
        walls depict the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> at its most splendid with abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and
        depictions of wine-making. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tomb of Mena</ENAMEX> (number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>) is also
        worth a visit for realistic scenes of harvesting and threshing. Tomb
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>, that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khaemhat</ENAMEX>, was decorated with statues of himself and his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">family‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇvery</ENAMEX> rare for tombs of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramose‚Äôs Tomb</ENAMEX> is also
        important. A high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amenophis IV</ENAMEX>, he began to
        prepare an elaborate resting place decorated with fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bas-reliefs</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tomb</ENAMEX> was abandoned when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amenophis</ENAMEX> abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thebes</ENAMEX> and made a new
        capital at Tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">el-Amarna</ENAMEX> to the north. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Ramose</ENAMEX> dutifully followed his
        master there to engage in an experimental new way of living.
        Before turning off the coastal plain into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kings</ENAMEX>, one of the most impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theban</ENAMEX> temples comes into view on
        the left, that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Hatshepsut</ENAMEX>. She was a remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, gaining
        power as regent for the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Tutmosis II‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇher stepson‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇbefore
        usurping it for herself by claiming divine right to rule. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of
        Hatshepsut, dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hathor</ENAMEX>, is a vast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-tiered
        structure carved into the base of the rose-colored hillside facing out
        towards the river. Each level has a colonnaded fa√ßade, and as you
        approach on foot it gives you the opportunity to take in the monumental
        scale.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lower Terrace</ENAMEX> is cut by a wide ramp leading to a large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Terrace</ENAMEX> level and a smaller ramp leading to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Upper Terrace</ENAMEX> (unfortunately closed to visitors).
        Behind the colonnades on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle Terrace</ENAMEX>, to the left
        of the ramp, are carved scenes depicting a trade mission bringing myrrh
        and incense from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egypt‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Punt</ENAMEX>, now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>. A small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hathor</ENAMEX> sitting to the left of the colonnade has columns carved with the
        cow‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> that depicted her. To the right the walls are carved with
        scenes from the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queen Hatshepsut</ENAMEX> including her divine birth
        where her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is shown being attended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heket</ENAMEX>, the frog-headed
        midwife god, watched over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amun</ENAMEX> himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anubis</ENAMEX> (God of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mummification</ENAMEX>) has a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> here and you will clearly see his
        jackal-headed form on the walls.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carvings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hatshepsut</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defaced</ENAMEX>. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutmosis II</ENAMEX> tried to remove all traces of her at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Karnak</ENAMEX> when he finally became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaoh</ENAMEX> following her death,
        but this does not spoil the formidable architectural achievement of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> itself.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley of the Kings</ENAMEX> lies out of view in the hills
        behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hatshepsut‚Äôs Temple</ENAMEX>. As you turn to head up into the valley,
        look for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the left surrounded by shady <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. This was the
        field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Carter</ENAMEX> during the long search that finally
        resulted in the finding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tutankhamun‚</ENAMEX>Äôs treasure-filled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>.
        Tickets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley of the Kings</ENAMEX> allow you to visit
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tombs, so if you want to visit more you must buy several tickets.
        There are over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> tombs in the valley‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand some still yet to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">discovered‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdating c.1490‚Äì1100 b.c.</ENAMEX> , but not all will be open on your
        visit. The most impressive and important are listed below.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb of Tutankhamun</ENAMEX> (number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>) is without a doubt the
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX>, but the interior is disappointing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> died very
        young and artisans had only just begun to dig the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>, so it‚Äôs
        small and sparsely decorated. Undoubtedly the discovery of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undisturbed</ENAMEX> tomb and its vast treasure trove in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX> is what maintains
        its popularity. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King‚</ENAMEX>Äôs mummy is the only one still in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">situ‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇmany</ENAMEX> others are on display in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> (see
        page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>). Extra fee to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>.
        Other tombs in the valley are much more instructive about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX> life, death, and the afterlife. They are also larger and more
        brilliantly decorated.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb of Ramses VI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9</ENAMEX>) reopened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> after major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">renovations</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb shaft</ENAMEX> is decorated with excellent paintings
        depicting chapters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of the Dead‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> rituals to be
        performed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX> to reach the afterlife.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tomb of Seti I</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.1279 b.c.</ENAMEX> , is one of the
        largest tombs in the valley boasting some of the finest decoration.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pits</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> before
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chamber</ENAMEX> is reached. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX> pays his respects to the
        deities including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kephri</ENAMEX> as he makes his symbolic journey.
        Masons dug a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">shaft 10 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ft) into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bedrock</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses III‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX>) c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1151</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX> then continue 125 m (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">410</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chamber</ENAMEX>. Look for scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> sailing on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nile</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of war including spears and shields. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> harpists
        sing the praises of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses</ENAMEX> before the deities, giving rise to the
        temple‚Äôs alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">name‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇTemple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harpists</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses IV</ENAMEX> was responsible for saving many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX>
        of his ancestors after tomb <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robbers</ENAMEX> desecrated their places of rest,
        stealing the treasures without thought for the reputation of the dead
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>. He organized the rewrapping of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX> and devised a
        secret hiding place for them in a narrow valley behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hatshepsut</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> has good wall reliefs protected by glass
        screens.
        A splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red granite sarcophagus</ENAMEX> has pride of place in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb of Horemheb</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll need to walk down a long steep corridor to
        reach it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety</ENAMEX> steps will lead you down to the depths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Amenophis II</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">35</NUMEX>); it is the deepest in the valley. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mummies</ENAMEX>
        were found here when archaeologists opened it, leading to a
        much-improved understanding of the genealogy of the various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynasties</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most remote tombs, that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutmosis III</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">34</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.1425 b.c.</ENAMEX> , in the far west of the valley rewards the intrepid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wanderer</ENAMEX>. A rickety flight of steps links with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb entrance</ENAMEX> before
        you make your way down inside to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ornate burial chamber</ENAMEX>. As you
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">descend</ENAMEX> look for images of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 700</NUMEX> deities decorating the walls before
        reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> with its finely carved red sandstone sarcophagus;
        a royal cartouche (hieroglyphic name plate) above the lintel heralds
        your arrival. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tutmosis</ENAMEX> chose the location of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb well</ENAMEX> for it was
        not totally robbed in antiquity and numerous artifacts found in the
        antechambers are now on show in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of Luxor
        Though independent travel is difficult north of Luxor
        because of security precautions put in place to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> (see
        driving, page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX>), there are still <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple complexes</ENAMEX> that can be
        visited from your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX>. Booking a tour is probably your
        easiest option.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Denderah</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 60 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">43 miles</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX>. Major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cow Goddess Hathor</ENAMEX>, it was begun in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptolemaic</ENAMEX> era, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">c.125 b.c.</ENAMEX> , making it one of the later <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX>. It was a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of female deity worship in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Egypt</ENAMEX>
        at the time and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra</ENAMEX> worshipped here. She, in
        turn, was worshipped by her subjects as a living god. There is a unique
        relief of the queen found on the rear fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, the only
        representation from her lifetime to have been identified. The Romans
        completed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 60</TIMEX> and as you explore the interior you can
        see the cartouches of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> emperors on the walls. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denderah</ENAMEX> also has
        excellent ceiling detail, depicting goddess <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nut</ENAMEX> on her journey across
        the sky, though they have been blackened by the fires of Coptic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> who later made the temple their home. If you are
        not claustrophobic, take the opportunity to enter the crypt below the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> floor, as the carvings here were never defaced and are still
        precise and clean. Then climb up to the roof and take in the splendid
        views of the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and the magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> valley
        beyond.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Denderah</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abydos</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">93 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luxor</ENAMEX>,
        and erected for the worship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osiris</ENAMEX>, God of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underworld</ENAMEX>. It was a
        major funerary site of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pharaohs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c.3100‚Äì2755 b.c.</ENAMEX>
        ) and early mastabas can be found all around the site. The primary
        place of worship was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Seti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, which even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is an
        impressive sight. Built of limestone, it honored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>
        who had passed on into the afterlife. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seti</ENAMEX> commissioned the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1291 and 1279</TIMEX> b.c. , the colonnaded courtyards and ramps
        on its fa√ßade were added by his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses II</ENAMEX> who usurped his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>,
        trying every way possible to excise his name from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> walls.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliefs</ENAMEX> carved into the stone show <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ramses</ENAMEX> being welcomed by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇparticularly Osiris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isis</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horus</ENAMEX> featured on the colonnade
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hypostyle halls</ENAMEX> with
        well-preserved papyrus columns and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Corridor of the Kings</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southwest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX>, you will find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> cartouches listing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pharaohs</ENAMEX> throughout
        the ages.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of Luxor
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> valley south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX> is home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> temple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>. These form the major stops of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile cruise</ENAMEX> and are all
        visited by tour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aswan</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, reached from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luxor</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Esna</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">54 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">33 miles</NUMEX>)
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has been built on top of much of the
        ancient site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Knum‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇram-headed god of creation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nile‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">source‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypostyle Hall</ENAMEX> remains
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">set 9 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ft) below the surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, begun in the
        reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiberius</ENAMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> takeover, has pleasing
        proportions and the interior is decorated with reliefs depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperors</ENAMEX> dressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pharaoh‚</ENAMEX>Äôs garb and worshipping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knum</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Fifty km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) further south is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Edfu</ENAMEX>,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, and one of the best-preserved.
        Dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Horus‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgod incarnate</ENAMEX> in the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pharaoh‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇhis granite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">falcon</ENAMEX> emblems guard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> entrance. The outer pylon is majestic.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">79 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">260 ft</ENAMEX>) wide and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">118 ft</ENAMEX>) high, it was built by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptolemies</ENAMEX> during a total reconstruction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in the years
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">237‚Äì105</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c. Edfu</ENAMEX> was built in the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> style and was
        little changed following its rebuilding. Behind the pylon is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX>, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hypostyle halls</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>. Around the
        whole structure is a retaining wall with a narrow corridor allowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to explore the carvings on every exterior wall. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Reliefs</ENAMEX> depict
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptolemaic Pharaohs worshipping Horus</ENAMEX>, and the interior carvings of
        their food offerings are especially impressive. The back walls of the
        pylon have scenes of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> meetings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horus</ENAMEX> and his consort
        Hathor, who traveled on a sacred barque (slender <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>) from her temple
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denderah</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reunion on the Nile</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> this
        was a time of celebration and there were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of exuberant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dancing</ENAMEX>, processions, and feasting. At the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, a
        small granite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> once held the sacred barque of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horus</ENAMEX> himself. For
        graphic scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horus‚</ENAMEX>Äô fight with his evil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth</ENAMEX> to avenge his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osiris</ENAMEX>, walk around the exterior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to the west side,
        where the whole event is re-created. This one incident reveals the
        Egyptians‚Äô ultimate belief in achieving the victory of ‚ÄúGood over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evil‚Äù‚Äàthrough</ENAMEX> conduct in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> matters. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were finely
        balanced.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kom Ombo Temple</ENAMEX> lies closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aswan</ENAMEX> ‚Äî <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 60 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edfu</ENAMEX>. It has one of the prettiest settings of any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> on a knoll by the side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX> with views both up
        and downstream. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kom Ombo</ENAMEX> is an unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in that it is dedicated
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gods</ENAMEX>. Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aswan Dam</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of crocodiles, and some would gather on the
        muddy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> here to sun themselves. Egyptians revered the strong and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient creatures</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kom Ombo</ENAMEX> is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sobek</ENAMEX>, the crocodile
        god. It is also dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Horus</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egyptians</ENAMEX> thought that this
        was the place where the final battle between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seth</ENAMEX> (in the
        form of a crocodile) took place. As you enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> site you‚Äôll
        see a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> housing several mummified crocodiles worshipped at the
        site, though they do have a moth-eaten appearance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also see
        reliefs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sobek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horus</ENAMEX> flanking the entrance. The main attraction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kom Ombo</ENAMEX> is the vibrant color still found on the columns in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hypostyle Hall</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> would appear vividly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colored‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇmuch like the tombs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kings‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇbut little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">color</ENAMEX> has survived on most of them due to the effects of sunlight and
        smoke damage caused by fires when the temples were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX>.
        Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> itself the gods share <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypostyle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halls</ENAMEX> and an inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sanctum</ENAMEX>. Each pays tribute to the other in reliefs on the interior
        walls.
        Aswan
        Aswan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egypt‚</ENAMEX>Äôs southernmost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, has played an important
        role throughout its long history. It marked the ancient border with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nubia</ENAMEX> to the south and was the conduit for the camel caravan trade in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> products such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>. The word aswan
        actually means ‚Äútrade‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúmarket‚Äù in ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>, signifying its
        most pre-eminent activity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a high percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nubians</ENAMEX> in
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>; these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, though fully integrated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>, remain proud of their separate cultural identity.
        Aswan became a backwater following the decline of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian Empire</ENAMEX>, far removed from power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>.
        It began to feel the benefits of tourism as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luxor</ENAMEX> did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Grand Tour</ENAMEX>, but has been transformed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the Aswan
        High Dam <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> arrived to help with the mammoth project to stem the annual
        floods that plagued the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and provide hydroelectricity to power
        a growth in industry. Completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> it has achieved both, but the
        fertility of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> farming land is now falling as it is cut off from
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> layer of fresh nutrients brought by the flood. A visit to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX> brings home the immense technological feat and allows you to
        gaze out over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Nasser</ENAMEX>, created by the blocking of the river, which
        is now <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 500 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">310 miles</NUMEX>) in length, spanning the border with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>.
        For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Egyptians, Aswan</ENAMEX> was the place where the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> flood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX> began. They could not travel upriver because
        several sets of cataracts blocked passage and they did not know that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> traveled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">heartland</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. They worshipped the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nile</ENAMEX> as the bringer of life and built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> here to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile god</ENAMEX>,
        Hapy, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX> god, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Knum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was also important for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharaohs</ENAMEX> because it sat close to one of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite quarries</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, providing stone for many
        of its <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest temples.</TIMEX> The huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> were hauled to the quaysides to
        be carried upriver. Today, a visit to the quarries, just outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>,
        reveals some of the secrets of how the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Egyptians</ENAMEX> worked the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX>. A huge unfinished obelisk lies prone but not free from the face.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">immense monument‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit</ENAMEX> would have been the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> had it
        been <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">completed‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfractured</ENAMEX> along a fault line and was abandoned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">b.c.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downtown Aswan</ENAMEX> has a pleasant riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corniche</ENAMEX> where you
        can stroll and watch the world go by. At its southern end you‚Äôll find
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Cataract Hotel</ENAMEX>, harking back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edwardian</ENAMEX> elegance.
        It has seen such illustrious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX> and Agatha
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>, who wrote her thriller <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Death on the Nile</ENAMEX> while staying here.
        The river looks wonderful from its period <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> and flower-strewn
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX>, and it‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">de rigueur</TIMEX> to enjoy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> while admiring the view.
        On the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to the south, only a few
        minutes‚Äô walk from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> is the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nubian Museum</ENAMEX>. With a
        research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> dedicated to promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nubian</ENAMEX> traditions
        such as dance and music, it also displays finds rescued from several
        archaeological sites that were subsequently flooded by the waters of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Nasser</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the great pleasures of a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aswan</ENAMEX> is taking a
        felucca out onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX>. These traditional low-drafted craft ply
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">effortlessly</ENAMEX> and quietly through the water guided by their experienced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>. Their white sails make a beautiful sight, especially at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>.
        You can make several separate trips to view all the attractions that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has to offer, and you‚Äôll certainly get used to the slow pace
        of these windblown <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>. On the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">river‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇset</ENAMEX> in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">desert landscape‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coptic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simeon</ENAMEX> now sadly in ruins, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mausoleum</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aga Khan</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1877‚Äì1957</ENAMEX>), spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the Ismaili <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> sect. From the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> on the west bank it‚Äôs a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-minute</TIMEX> walk across the sand,
        though this is not recommended. You can take a taxi or try a camel
        ride, very appropriate given the terrain.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX> offer contrasting attractions.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">northernmost‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇKitchener Island‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwas</ENAMEX> given as a gift to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> of the same name after his victories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 19th century</TIMEX>. It is also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Botanical Island</ENAMEX> for the
        exotic gardens created there. This is an excellent place to come and
        sit in the shade among the fragrant blooms. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of Kitchener Island</ENAMEX>
        is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elephantine Island</ENAMEX>, home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple of Knum</ENAMEX>. To honor the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ram</ENAMEX>-headed god, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX> created a necropolis of mummified rams at the
        site, covering the animals‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpses</ENAMEX> with gold leaf. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> they are on
        view in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on site but their stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sarcophagi</ENAMEX> still lie in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. You can also view a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Nileometer</ENAMEX> carved in the rock
        which measured the height of the river and helped the ancient priests
        to time the announcement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile flood</ENAMEX> that initiated a movement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from the fields to community projects such as temple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
        It was refurbished in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian era</TIMEX> but rendered useless by
        succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile dams</ENAMEX>.
        The creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Nasser</ENAMEX> as a consequence of the
        building of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aswan High Dam</ENAMEX> caused many social and political
        concerns, not least because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> were due to overwhelm a number
        of important ancient monuments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audacious</ENAMEX> plans were announced to move
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the most important and recreate them in exact detail on higher
        ground out of danger. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX> asked for international help to
        fund the projects, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> stepped in to provide money and
        expertise.
        The nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aswan Town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philae</ENAMEX>. Originally
        built on an island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nile</ENAMEX>, it was already semi-submerged following
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the first <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aswan Dam</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>. It was important to find a
        new island location where they could recreate the site, and one was
        found <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 300 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">900 ft</ENAMEX>) north of the original setting. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty thousand</NUMEX>
        blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> had to be labeled, moved and re-erected before the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transformation</ENAMEX> was complete so that you can take a short boat ride out
        to the island, and enjoy views of the approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, just as
        the ancients did.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philae Temple</ENAMEX> was known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúPearl of Egypt‚</ENAMEX>Äù for its
        beauty and picturesque setting. Dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isis</ENAMEX>, and her
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of worship, it was inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c.
        Worship carried on here longer than in other pagan sites in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, with
        texts stating that pilgrims came as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as the fourth century</TIMEX> a.d. It
        was later converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coptic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> place of worship and their
        crosses can still be seen carved into the lintels and door frames. The
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isis</ENAMEX> was expanded throughout its long lifetime. The
        impressive outer pylon was erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> b.c. to
        surround the older inner sanctum. The agora-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Nactenabo</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">381‚Äì362 b.c.</ENAMEX> ) stands in front of the pylon. Small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> lead from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, honoring local gods, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imhotep</ENAMEX>, the great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> who was deified in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> after his
        death. Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">birthing chamber</ENAMEX> or mammisi, where
        carved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reliefs</ENAMEX> depict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isis</ENAMEX> holding her new-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horus</ENAMEX>. A second
        inner pylon shows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ptolemy</ENAMEX> XIII paying homage to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Isis</ENAMEX> who is flanked by
        her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osiris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horus</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> were active worshippers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philae</ENAMEX> even adding
        their own touches. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiosk</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trajan</ENAMEX>, a beautiful building
        with ornate floral capitals supported by elegant Corinthian columns,
        makes a striking contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> designs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philae</ENAMEX> has
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most evocative sound and light shows in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, so do try and
        make time to return in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> to see it .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Simbel</ENAMEX>
        Considered one of the greatest architectural achievements
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Egyptians</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple complex</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Simbel</ENAMEX> is also one
        of the most famous. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> did not build it from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> but had it
        hewn into the cliffs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile valley</ENAMEX> at a spot that stands <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 7 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> border, in the ancient land of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nubia</ENAMEX>. When
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Nasser</ENAMEX> threatened to flood the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> had
        the unenviable task of formulating a plan to save it and this they did
        with consummate skill. An artificial cliffside was created on higher
        ground, matching the old in height and alignment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> stones
        were then dismantled and moved into place within this hill recreating
        the old site exactly, including leaving old fallen pieces on the ground
        in the place where they were originally excavated.
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses</ENAMEX> built these temples in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX> b.c. ,
        he was at the height of his power and was stamping his mark all around
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>. In addition to asserting his authority over this region,
        the temples were also used for the storage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and other precious
        cargos carried by caravan from central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.
        The fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ramses II</ENAMEX> is one of the most
        enduring images of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and though you may have seen them in
        photographs, they are truly breathtaking in reality. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        monumental colossi of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ramses II</ENAMEX> that frame the entrance stand <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>) high and they are aligned to face the rising sun, to be infused
        with the energy of the sun god <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharaoh</ENAMEX> sits impassively,
        wearing the double crown signifying his control over both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper</ENAMEX> and
        Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. Standing at his feet are diminutive representations of his
        family. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliefs</ENAMEX> carved on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ramses‚Äô thrones depict the Nile gods</ENAMEX>, and in
        a niche between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colossi</ENAMEX> is a small statue to the god
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ra-Herekhty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ra</ENAMEX> the sun god combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horus</ENAMEX>) with whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses</ENAMEX>
        shares the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>.
        The design of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> did not incorporate a forecourt
        and so you enter directly into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hypostyle Hall</ENAMEX>. Carvings on the
        columns show <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ramses‚ÄÇ(¬</ENAMEX>≠in the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osiris</ENAMEX>) making offerings to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods</ENAMEX>, but around the walls he is seen smitinghis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> duringbattles in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> and is depicted as returning in triumph with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of Hittite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>. The inner sanctum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was aligned so that the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> rays of the sun on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 October</TIMEX> would fall on the
        sacred barque deposited here and on the statues of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four gods</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptah</ENAMEX>,
        Amun, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses II</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ra-Herekhty</ENAMEX>), though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> are still not sure
        what was so propitious about these dates.
        Near to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Ramses II</ENAMEX> is a smaller edifice, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Nefertari</ENAMEX>, his beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. She, too, is deified and in a
        fa√ßade of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six colossi 111/2 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ft) high stands at equal height to
        her husband‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa very rare honor for a consort in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Egypt‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthough his
        statues outnumber hers by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:1</TIMEX>, a more subtle indication of his supreme
        power. The royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> can be seen in miniature at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the feet</NUMEX> of
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Within the complex‚Äîdedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hathor</ENAMEX>, her ‚Äúcows head‚Äù
        form decorates the columns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hypostyle Hall‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nefertari</ENAMEX> made offerings to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, and one showing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pharaoh</ENAMEX> himself worshipping his deified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take the regular flights from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aswan</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu</ENAMEX>
        Simbel‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äîaround 50 minutes‚</NUMEX>Äîbut the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-hour</TIMEX> overland route offers a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fascinating insight</ENAMEX> into life away from the big tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>
        if you have more time.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea Coast</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX>
        After touring the dusty hot archaeological sites of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nile Valley</ENAMEX>, or tramping the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">noisy streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX> coast
        makes a welcome contrast. With cooling sea breezes and good sandy
        beaches it offers all the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredients</ENAMEX> needed for a relaxing
        vacation; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> hoteliers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">restaurateurs</ENAMEX> are working hard to
        provide the rest. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX> much of the coastline was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undeveloped</ENAMEX>, but a rash of building projects creates an almost
        continuous ribbon all along the shoreline.
        The most established <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurghada</ENAMEX> whose small offshore
        islands sit among some of the best diving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> in the world. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCUBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> made this remote settlement their own, but with the
        building of an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hurghada</ENAMEX> has seen a great influx
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> from around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Some of the recent development is
        rather unattractive, but there are a number of excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX>
        providing just about everything you could want for a beach
        vacation.
        At the northern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX> coast, where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">continent of Africa</ENAMEX> meets the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai peninsula</ENAMEX>, is one of the greatest
        engineering feats of modern times, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX>. This manmade artery
        linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX>,
        allowed a much quicker journey time from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> when it was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX>, a great aid to the
        Western <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> powers in managing their expansive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empires</ENAMEX>. Though the
        advent of air travel negates the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to take a long sea
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">journey</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX> is still important for cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>, and
        watching <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a leviathan</NUMEX> tanker travel sedately through the passage is an
        unreal experience. Unless you actually stand beside the canal you can‚Äôt
        see the water and they look as though they are simply floating along on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX>
        This remote easternmost part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> is still sparsely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populated</ENAMEX>, and in its recent history it has been a political pawn
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. Its northern deserts were a battleground in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> conflicts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s and 1960s</TIMEX>, and it was occupied
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX> before it passed permanently back into
        Egypt‚Äôs hands with the treaty of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> is a wild and dramatically beautiful land
        pointing south out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX>. Although flat and monotonous sandy
        desert in the north, it rises in ranges of sandstone peaks in the south
        creating a strong contrast with the azure blue of the surrounding seas.
        Ancient seismic activity forced the stratified rock towards the sky and
        the action of wind and frost have fashioned it into bizarre shapes.
        Very little flourishes here‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇperhaps a solitary <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">acacia tree</ENAMEX> whose deep
        roots seek water deep below the surface‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut the odd desert <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox</ENAMEX> will
        raise its long ears above the skyline, and you‚Äôll still see family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of wild camels eking out an existence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> has long been
        the domain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedouin</ENAMEX>, nomadic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> who travel with their flocks
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> and camels, moving from pasture to pasture and living in large
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX>.
        Favored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Egyptians</ENAMEX> as a source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> was, until recently, famed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> event‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut certainly
        an important one. It was on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its highest peaks, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Sinai</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gebel Musa</ENAMEX>), that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> received the word of God written down as the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten Commandments</TIMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commandments</ENAMEX> form the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for a number of
        the world‚Äôs great religions. In modern times the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> had become a
        backwater protected from the ravages of the modern world, and perhaps
        it would have remained one of the world‚Äôs undiscovered spots if it
        hadn‚Äôt been for one invention: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self Contained Underwater Breathing</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apparatus</ENAMEX> (SCUBA). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> around the coast are some of the clearest
        in the world and the depths are filled with amazing coral and many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and other marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1950s</TIMEX> and 1960s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharm El-Sheikh</ENAMEX> on the southern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> became a divers‚Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">paradise</ENAMEX> and since then this small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> has grown and spread north
        along several adjacent bays. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have sprung up along
        the sandy beaches, and these have been followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, making today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharm El-Sheikh</ENAMEX> not just a diving destination
        but a true tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. Sharm itself has little charm, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na‚</ENAMEX>Äôam
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) further north, has a wonderful sandy beach,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modern hotels</ENAMEX>, and just about everything you could need for a
        fun-filled vacation. Book ahead during the high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> come
        from the world over.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> had the sense to
        protect the precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south Sinai</ENAMEX> and created <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ras Mohammed</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park</ENAMEX>, now home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,000</NUMEX> species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, marine <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>,
        and corals. Considered one of the premier diving sites in the world, it
        encompasses several different underwater environments in addition to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> shallows where colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> thrive in the warm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Divers</ENAMEX>
        can explore the deeps but you can also snorkel here, or take a
        glass-bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">submarine</ENAMEX> tour to get a glimpse of this watery
        world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ras Mohammed</ENAMEX> also protects the environment along the shoreline
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX>, including rare mangrove <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> with abundant bird
        life.
        Tourist development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> is mainly along the east
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> meets the waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Aqaba</ENAMEX>, though
        there can be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">many miles between</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dahab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuweiba</ENAMEX> are
        growing but remains less developed than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharm El-Sheikh</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Vacationers</ENAMEX>
        come for the great diving, windsurfing, and other watersports. At the
        very northern tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taba</ENAMEX>, with several large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>,
        marking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> border.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Sinaiand St.Catherine‚Äôs Monastery</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Sinai</ENAMEX> has drawn pilgrims for generations and it was
        endowed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> place of worship <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as a.d. 527</TIMEX>, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Justinian</ENAMEX> built a small orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> in the lea of the
        mountain surrounded by sheer rock faces. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was built on what
        is thought to be the spot where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> confronted the Burning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, but
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> had to confront far more mortal danger in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> following its foundation and its high sturdy protective walls
        give it the look of a fortress rather than a place of worship.
        The complex within, still home to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, is centered around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Catherine</ENAMEX> built
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">552</TIMEX> and dedicated to the saint when her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> were discovered
        nearby (on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount St. Catherine</ENAMEX>) over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years later</TIMEX>. It houses some of
        the treasures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, given by wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">benefactors</ENAMEX> throughout
        the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,500 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Catherine‚Äôs</ENAMEX> has long been a very wealthy and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">influential</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, founding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Orthodox</ENAMEX> world. The richly decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">iconostasis</ENAMEX> has highly regarded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">icons</ENAMEX> painted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeremias of Crete</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1612</TIMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX>
        mosaics on the ceiling of the apse are the church‚Äôs most impressive
        feature. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Catherine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs skull lies within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her</TIMEX> marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>, carved in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>. A smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> of the Burning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> sits within the
        complex marking the spot where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> stood. Many guides point out a
        green healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> as a regeneration of the
        original.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> you‚Äôll share your visit with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>,
        as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> is within easy reach of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, but not
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX> up the slope to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Sinai</ENAMEX> to visit the tiny
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chapel</ENAMEX> and take in the truly spectacular views of the surrounding
        mountains. It is an almost spiritual experience at sunrise when the
        sun‚Äôs rays break over a silent world. The hike takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 2 hours</TIMEX> and
        you can travel the lower slopes by camel if you‚Äôd rather not walk the
        whole way. If you intend to start early take warm clothing and don‚Äôt
        forget your camera!
