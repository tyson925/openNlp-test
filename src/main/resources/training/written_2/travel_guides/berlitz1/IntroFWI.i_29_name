        They‚Äôre <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, indisputably spiced with an intriguing
        Caribbean flavor. These perpetually sunny islands are also very
        beautiful in the best tropical manner: a riot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, tangled green
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, mountain waterfalls, dramatic rocky headlands, beaches of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tan</ENAMEX>, or black volcanic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>. And the sunsets are
        breathtaking.
        Each of the islands has an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> shore
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">water‚Äôs hues</ENAMEX> spanning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-spectrum</ENAMEX> from pale green to
        midnight blue. In the sparkling, unpolluted sea, fishing techniques
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haven‚Äôt</ENAMEX> changed much since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> claimed these remote outposts for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500 years ago</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashore</ENAMEX>, fields of sugarcane and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> drape
        steep hills and rolling plains. Volcanoes, hummingbirds, mangroves,
        mongooses, and palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> complete the picture. The heat is year-round
        (average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25¬∫</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/77¬∫ F</ENAMEX>), but so are the trade winds that temper it.
        ‚Äú Our little corner in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean‚</ENAMEX>Äù crows the publicity
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. Actually, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies</ENAMEX> (FWI), or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX>
        Fran√ßaises as they‚Äôre called in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, are not at all a neat
        geographical cluster. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">few dozen</NUMEX> islands and rocks are widely
        scattered along the great curving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Lesser Antilles</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinique</ENAMEX>, much the largest of the islands
        and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 160 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 miles</NUMEX>) apart, are becoming internationally known
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>. To the north, little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Barth√©lemy</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> side of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Martin</ENAMEX> (the other side is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>) have as much charm‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwithout the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bustle</ENAMEX>. Though some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">256 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">160 miles</NUMEX>) away, they‚Äôre dependencies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>. So are the tiny eastern and southern satellites of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D√©sirade</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Galante</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Saintes</ENAMEX>.
        All of the islands are now officially and proudly part of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> as they were for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some three centuries</TIMEX>. Martinique
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>, formal d√©partements since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>, have recently become
        r√©gions in an administrative reshuffle. Each has a pr√©fet named in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, and sends <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> more than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,400 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,000 miles</NUMEX>) to sit in the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX>. To <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, about
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,900 miles</NUMEX>) away, they send back streams of contented
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Antilles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> enjoy the same state benefits as
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, drink the same famous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, and eat the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheeses</ENAMEX> and pat√©s on baguettes just as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crustily delicious</ENAMEX> as those
        turned out by every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bakery</ENAMEX> in the m√©tropole. And yet, despite the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flocks of</ENAMEX> familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> with yellow headlights, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">francs</ENAMEX> and centimes, the gendarmes, caf√©s, and just-like-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll sense immediately that this is not, nor could it ever be,
        metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>.
        The atmosphere is richer, more exotic: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Africans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asians</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> of various origins have become absorbed and
        transformed into the fascinating culture known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX>. By world
        standards, this racially varied society is a model of harmony.
        What will strike you first is the marvelous range of subtly
        different skin tones and facial features. The famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        inevitably wearing bright earrings and flashing colors, manage to be
        both graceful and sensuous as they walk. This is true even when they
        glide along country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> with large bundles balanced on their heads.
        Little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> learn this sure-fire posture-improver very early in
        life.
        In these already overpopulated islands, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX> is the predominant religion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> provides an
        initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lump</ENAMEX> sum for each birth and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> support grant, allocation
        familiale, for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Because of the male exodus to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and
        elsewhere in search of jobs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> continue to outnumber <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. More than
        half of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native islanders</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is
        traditionally responsible for bringing them up, handling the money, and
        making key domestic decisions.
        Everyone agrees there‚Äôs a special magic to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>.
        Smiling readily but somewhat shy about making the first approach, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> will often overwhelm you with kindness once contact is made.
        Honesty is taken for granted. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a simplicity, a lack of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complication</ENAMEX>, about many local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, yet something, too, of the
        sophistication associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.
        Away from tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> and shopping areas, rarely will
        any language be spoken except <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and the mystifying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole patois</ENAMEX>,
        which, though based on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, is almost incomprehensible to anyone not
        used to it‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeven non-initiated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of all ages
        will invariably go out of their way to help a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX>. The biggest
        marque d‚Äôattention a tourist can receive is to be invited to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> soon notice how easy it is to get a cheerful early
        start on these islands. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Punch</ENAMEX>, the ubiquitous drink of local <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX>,
        sugarcane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syrup</ENAMEX>, and lime, is popular from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn to dusk</TIMEX>. And along with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">punch</ENAMEX>, gossiping is a favorite pastime in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and girls
        washing clothes along the river <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> are probably doing so if they‚Äôre
        not singing. And it‚Äôs a safe bet that in the open-air markets, the
        sales-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> under the big straw hats are gossiping too‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbetween
        transactions involving such prized local items as guavas, tamarinds,
        red pimentos, and plantains.
        While tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> abound, along with a
        satisfying variety of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> is imported,
        primarily from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. Nowhere else in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> can you eat as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imaginatively</ENAMEX> or as well. Traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> dishes are as highly
        esteemed as the spicy specialties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> cuisine.
        As on most tropical islands, the pace of life tends to be
        lazy. During the hottest <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>, things come to a virtual standstill,
        though the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> siesta is an hour or two shorter than its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>. It would be folly for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to expect
        American-style efficiency or speedy service; it would be wisest to slip
        into the casual drift of things <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Indian</ENAMEX>. Whether eating, touring,
        or shopping, taking your time will always be rewarding.
        But when the sun goes down and the music starts up, there‚Äôs
        nothing lazy about the dancing. This is where the biguine began and
        still belongs, along with all manner of other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> rhythms just as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">popular</ENAMEX> and even more frenzied. They say that if you can understand
        their dancing, you‚Äôll have begun to understand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs
        certainly worth trying.
        Not fully ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù and certainly unspoiled, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative newcomers</ENAMEX> on the world tourist scene. Though their economic
        well-being is about the most precarious of any part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, these
        basically agricultural islands can and do provide the scenery, the sun,
        the sea, and the sand in sufficient quantity to attract rapidly growing
        numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> looking for fun, relaxation, and... something
        different.
