        Guadeloupe
        Proudly styling itself the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean‚Äôs ‚Äúemerald isle</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> is actually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands linked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">drawbridges</ENAMEX> across the
        narrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-water <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sal√©e River</ENAMEX>. Guadeloupe, from the air or on a map,
        resembles a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX>.
        This largest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> spreads its wings midway along the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lesser Antilles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>. Its major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> are volcano-devastated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antigua</ENAMEX> to the north and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominica</ENAMEX> to the south, the
        latter separating it from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus</ENAMEX> named it after his favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadaloupe</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estremadura</ENAMEX>. To the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carib Indians</ENAMEX> then living
        here, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karukera</ENAMEX>, island of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll see why.
        Between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> world wars, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Roosevelt</ENAMEX>
        stopped by, was entranced by ‚Äúthe beautiful countryside and friendly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe,‚Äù</ENAMEX> and predicted that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> would soon be visiting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each winter</TIMEX>. It took the advent of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jetliners</ENAMEX> and cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> for that to happen.
        Less conservative than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique, Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> of late seems
        to be bidding to become the nudist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Several
        of its beaches are officially designated for nudism (known locally as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">naturisme)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> most popular being <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe Tarare‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> a functionary
        who is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevalier de la L√</ENAMEX>©gion d‚ÄôHonneur has been appointed to
        supervise all aspects of sunning in the buff.
        Guadeloupe‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> component islands are notably dissimilar
        and confusingly named. Grande-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Land</ENAMEX>) is smaller (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">565 sq</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">km/218 sq miles</NUMEX>), drier, flatter, and more important because it has
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs commercial center and largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Low Land</ENAMEX>), is higher, bigger (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">808 sq km/312 sq miles</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">greener</ENAMEX>, and has the political capital, also called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX>, which
        is near the famous will-it-or-won‚Äôt-it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Soufri√</ENAMEX>®re volcano. The islands‚Äô
        names refer to the different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> winds hitting them, not their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topography</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 410,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 40,000</NUMEX> on
        its administrative dependencies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Barth√©lemy</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Galante</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Saintes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√©sirade</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two-thirds</NUMEX> are classified as
        mulattoes, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 16,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian Indians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> form <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 percent</NUMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> born here <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 50%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is still under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years of age</TIMEX>. The high population
        density constitutes a real problem.
        Scattered around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 50</NUMEX> stately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation homes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> and stone, recalling the distant
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> prosperity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôre</ENAMEX> also likely to see modest modern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> being transported from place to place on flat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>.
        Guadeloupeans, who don‚Äôt always own land, like to move around.
        Sightseeing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> is most rewarding by rental car,
        boat, or both. Otherwise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> offer guided tours to scenic points.
        Small local <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> or collective <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX> are inexpensive and useful for
        point-to-point travel (complete with transistor music and an abundance
        of happy humanity), but not for general touring. Guadeloupe‚Äôs ordinary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">taxis</ENAMEX> may also be hired, but are extremely expensive.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>
        When this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was only a tiny fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> three
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries ago</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutchman</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter</ENAMEX> is said to have been the most
        popular fish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peddler</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> on the waterfront. Even though he
        wasn‚Äôt <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pieter</ENAMEX> the name <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pointe</ENAMEX>-a-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitre</ENAMEX> was eventually
        derived.
        Today, weathered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schooners</ENAMEX> chug past yachts and
        gargantuan passenger liners to dock in this curious tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">port</ENAMEX>,
        which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and gateway to the world. A
        formless amalgam of wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shacks</ENAMEX> and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment buildings</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oriental</ENAMEX>-style bazaars and shopping-center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarkets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pointe-√†</ENAMEX>-Pitre
        betrays little of its turbulent past. The traffic jams seem
        incongruous, but they‚Äôre authentic. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> should allow the tourist
        ample time for city sightseeing and shopping.
        Don‚Äôt miss the open-air market close by the wharves. This
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX> at their most colorful. Aside from exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX>,
        strange roots, land crabs, dried <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, and nuts, you can pick
        up ‚Äúspiritual spray‚Äù for your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, ointments designed to bring you
        money, lotions and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powders</ENAMEX> for your ailments, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby pig</ENAMEX>. Some of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> under the bright umbrellas are real herbalists‚Äô heavens, but
        even if you can understand the patois, it‚Äôs difficult to learn the
        precise uses for certain mysterious-looking items.
        Close by (nothing that matters in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX> is far
        away) is the center of youthful social <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Äúaction‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Place de la</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victoire</ENAMEX>, sprawling in the shade of sandbox <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. During <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> phase of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Revolution</ENAMEX>, a guillotine shortened many lives here, though
        the fact is deliberately forgotten by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> eyeing the girls
        pretending to ignore the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>. Just off this pleasant main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find the useful state tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office du</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourisme</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre‚Äôs cathedral</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basilique Saint-Pierre et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Paul</ENAMEX>, features unusual metal columns and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>. It was the
        creation, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>, of a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monsieur Trouille</ENAMEX> (Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúJitters‚Äù</ENAMEX>).
        Destroyed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hurricanes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX> and rebuilt each time,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is now said to be almost entirely constructed of pieces of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iron</ENAMEX>. Its simple beauty is enhanced by locally designed stained-glass
        windows in red, blue, orange, and yellow. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is on Place
        Gourbeyre, opposite the modest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palais de Justice</ENAMEX> and just a few steps
        from the city‚Äôs main shopping district, which embraces rues <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nozi√®res</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fr√©bault</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schoelcher</ENAMEX>.
        Wandering in these fascinating little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> is best in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> and heat are
        reduced. You‚Äôll see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of iron-grilled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> reminiscent of
        that other former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>.
        The almost midtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massabielle</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> (faubourg de
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massabielle</ENAMEX>), is sometimes described as the most ‚Äúpicturesque‚Äù in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a warren of wooden and corrugated-iron cabins, housing a
        remarkable number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Discretion when using your camera is
        advisable here.
        Around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grande</ENAMEX>-Terre
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> formidable cannon greet you at the wooden drawbridge
        entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Fleur</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôEp√©e, which commands access to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre‚Äôs harbor</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10-minute</TIMEX> drive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        Late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> fought
        bloody hand-to-hand battles for this strategic hill, considered the key
        to the defense of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>. Today <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> chirp in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> at
        this totally tranquil spot. In the dungeon-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> of the fort‚Äôs
        lower reaches, relics and documents relating to the war were kept in a
        decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> until the humidity destroyed them, and it was then
        closed to the public. Now it is reopened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
        A little past the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> built for local dramatic
        performances, there‚Äôs a fine view across the bay to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few miles</NUMEX> down the coast at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gosier</ENAMEX>, although it‚Äôs
        difficult to imagine, contingents of fierce invaders used to put
        ashore. Today this is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Guadeloupe‚Äôs ‚ÄúRiviera</ENAMEX>,‚Äù with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> strung
        along the beaches and tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> laid out among the coconut
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
        To reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gosier‚</ENAMEX>Äôs attractive offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">islet</ENAMEX> requires a
        challenging swim or an easy boat ride. Beneath the small lighthouse on
        this uninhabited speck of sand and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, picnicking and nude bathing
        are popular pastimes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windsurfers</ENAMEX> and sailboats on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aquamarine</ENAMEX>
        waters make a memorable <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> snapshot (best from the hillside
        village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gosier</ENAMEX> itself). Here, in the heart of the island‚Äôs tourist
        area, you‚Äôll find a number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and a few discotheques.
        Near the pleasant seaside village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sainte-Anne</ENAMEX> farther
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> is what is generally considered to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best beach. If
        you land by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caravelle</ENAMEX> beach is yours for the using; otherwise
        you‚Äôll have to pay a nominal charge to the vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club</ENAMEX> that owns the
        acreage. A sizable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> of this long curving beach of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> is
        devoted to naturisme; almost everywhere else on the entire strand,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toplessness</ENAMEX> holds sway in the current <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fashion, but nobody
        insists on it.
        Sainte-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> itself has a long, broad beach used not only by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> in vividly painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, but also by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> was named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis XIII</ENAMEX>,
        Queen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>.
        Inland from both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gosier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sainte-Anne</ENAMEX> is a peaceful
        region of green hills, or mornes, as they‚Äôre known in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>.
        Few of the tiny settlements identify themselves with signs; <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> are
        generally unmarked, and it can therefore be somewhat bewildering. But
        you can‚Äôt get lost for long, and in perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</TIMEX> of driving
        around this area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grands Fonds</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll get a real feeling for the
        pastoral simplicity that‚Äôs typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>. On the narrow roads
        that tend to twist without warning, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">you‚Äôll encounter cows</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sugarcane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagons</ENAMEX>, and little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        Back on the coast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Fran√</ENAMEX>ßois is a delightful fishing
        village. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any hour of the day</TIMEX> you‚Äôll see lobster traps being put
        together and nets being mended along the shore. An even more
        picturesque scene occurs when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> come in and jostling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewives</ENAMEX>
        buy the day‚Äôs catch direct from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>. More recently,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Fran√ßois</ENAMEX> has grown to be a major tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Fran√ßois</ENAMEX>, an excessively narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> heads
        straight to the easternmost point of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 km/30 miles</NUMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>) and one of the scenic highlights of the entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. This is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pointe des Ch√¢teaux</ENAMEX>, a wildly beautiful cliff
        formation with rocks shaped like castles, lashed and eroded by the
        Atlantic‚Äôs waves. You may well get sprinkled by sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> as you walk
        along the rocky bluff to the large cement cross erected (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1947</TIMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>) at the summit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> fail to go all the way. From this
        spectacular point, the view is outstanding. The large island in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La D√©sirade</ENAMEX>, the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Petite-Terre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">islets</ENAMEX> are much
        closer.
        A short distance away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pointe</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des Ch√¢teaux</ENAMEX>, the long <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tarare</ENAMEX> beach is another favorite with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nudists</ENAMEX>.
        A pre-columbian <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arawak Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> has been unearthed
        near the once-flourishing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Moule</ENAMEX>. Resort <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> in the
        area take advantage of several sandy beaches protected by breakwaters
        from the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> surf that pounds most of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grande¬≠-Terre‚Äôs</ENAMEX> east
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>. Most dramatic is the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Porte</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôEnfer (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate of Hell</ENAMEX>),
        where the waves have sliced a huge chasm into the limestone shoreline.
        At the innermost point, where the ocean‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> is completely spent but
        the booming waves can still be heard, is a small beach with shaded
        picnic area adjoining it.
        The sparsely inhabited northern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande-Terre</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sugarcane</ENAMEX> and cattle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice the</ENAMEX> windmills, mostly in ruins,
        that once ground <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane</ENAMEX>.
        At the end of a bumpy dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> as far north as you can go
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> is the magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pointe de la Grande Vigie</ENAMEX>. This spot
        is unbeatable for a picnic, or simply to contemplate nature‚Äôs wonders.
        Follow the signs to the sightseeing point where, on the predictably
        clear day, you can see across <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48‚Äàkm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) of blue ocean to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D√©sirade</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">67‚Äàkm</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 miles</NUMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antigua</ENAMEX>, and even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77‚</NUMEX>Äàkm (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 miles</NUMEX>) to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ash</ENAMEX>-covered peaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX>. Below, you‚Äôll hear the waves crashing
        into caves worn into the cliff-sides. This is a place where you‚Äôll
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exult</ENAMEX> in being alive.
        On a spur-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> just a little north of the sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anse-Bertrand</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anse Laborde</ENAMEX>, a public beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tan sand</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gorgeous turquoise waters</ENAMEX> and good snorkeling off rocky promontories.
        Farther south at the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Louis</ENAMEX> you can drive right
        to one of the island‚Äôs best beaches, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anse du Souffleur</ENAMEX>.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port-Louis</ENAMEX> all the way down <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grande Terre‚Äôs west</ENAMEX> coast
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX> there extend vast mangrove swamps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">They‚Äôre</ENAMEX> almost
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unreachable</ENAMEX> except by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, but rewarding for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> south passes through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of Petit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Morne-√†-l‚ÄôEau</ENAMEX>, both characteristic of rural, agricultural
        Guadeloupe, and through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs heavily populated satellite
        district of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Abymes</ENAMEX>.
        Around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse</ENAMEX>-Terre
        An undulating coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> completely encircles this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountainous</ENAMEX> and densely forested <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, but it‚Äôs much too long a trip
        to make comfortably in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>. Among the best excursions is one over
        another good <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, D <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>, directly through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Park</ENAMEX> which
        covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 74,000 acres</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs interior. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcross-country highway‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Travers√©e</ENAMEX>) continues west just beyond the
        breezy hilltop village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernou</ENAMEX>. Here, overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√</ENAMEX>©zarde river
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">valley</ENAMEX> with its swaying sugarcane, are elaborate secluded villas which
        seem a universe apart from the small sheds in which most Guadeloupeans
        live. As you drive along the winding road up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernou</ENAMEX>, notice the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> with huge, strange roots.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadeloupe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tropical rain forest, it‚Äôs worth stopping
        each time a wooden sign announces a particular attraction. The rustic
        Bras-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> picnic area, for example, is set alongside a burbling
        stream. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of the Forest</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Maison de la For√™t</ENAMEX>), there‚Äôs an
        audiovisual exhibit (in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> only), and you can take any of three
        guided walks along ‚Äúdiscovery trails‚Äù (sentiers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la d√©couverte</ENAMEX>)
        lasting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 20</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX>. For serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>, there are other
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
        It‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few hundred yards</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> along a
        fern-lined path to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crayfish Falls</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cascade</ENAMEX> aux <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecrevisses</ENAMEX>), a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">paradisiacal ‚Äúswimming hole‚Äù</ENAMEX> to splash around in. If you‚Äôre lucky,
        nobody else will be there to enjoy the waterfall, the rocks and ferns,
        and the picnic site. You‚Äôll see a sign announcing that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX>
        types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> and just off the road you‚Äôll find a
        nursery that sells specimens.
        Reassuring note: Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique, Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> has no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">poisonous snakes</ENAMEX> or other harmful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        On this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, the highest point comes at the Pass of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Breasts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LeCol des Mamelles</ENAMEX>), altitude <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">600 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,969 ft</NUMEX>), where it‚Äôs
        worth stopping for the view. For more sweeping panoramas, you can hike
        for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than an hour</TIMEX> to either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">summit‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇPetit</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourg</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">716 m/2,349 ft</NUMEX>)
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pigeon</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">770 m/2,526 ft</NUMEX>).
        For those not spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the entire day</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs
        possible to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX> by circling the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> section
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse</ENAMEX>-Terre along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. On the leeward coast, underwater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sportsmen</ENAMEX> can head for the simple fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pigeon</ENAMEX> to pick up
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to the tiny √Ælet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Pigeon</ENAMEX>. Otherwise, you drive north through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-Noire</ENAMEX> (named for its black volcanic hillsides) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deshaies</ENAMEX>, an
        unexceptional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on a very beautiful bay. Continuing on, you‚Äôll reach
        the much-admired surfing beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Anse</ENAMEX>, where fine brown sand
        slopes away from palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> to green-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. If you‚Äôve brought
        lunch, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grande Anse</ENAMEX> has pleasant shoreside picnic spots.
        Farther on you come to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sainte-Rose</ENAMEX>. Here in the 17th
        century the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> landing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duplessis</ENAMEX> ran into violent
        and unfriendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribs</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it‚Äôs a drowsily peaceful fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.
        On its outskirts the road crosses a river where you may see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        fishing or swimming off flat rocks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> washing clothes
        as they do in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs major rivers.
        While traveling on your way back through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamentin</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">expressway</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll pass seemingly endless fields of
        unusually tall sugarcane.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soufri√</ENAMEX>®re
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>, thick groves of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> (with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX> protected from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> by transparent bags) and fields of
        sugarcane stretch away from the southbound coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petit-Bourg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goyave</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">You‚Äôre</ENAMEX> now approaching the spot where Europeans
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> encountered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late in the 15th century</TIMEX>. But if you‚Äôre
        not watching close ly, you may miss the unprepossessing bust of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> perched atop a column in a little roadside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sainte-Marie</ENAMEX>, named by the explorer when he landed on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4‚</NUMEX>ÄÇNovember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>, attracted by the waterfalls and river he could see
        flowing down the green inland mountains. On the base of the white bust
        erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1916</TIMEX>, there‚Äôs a declaration in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> that it was here that
        Karukera became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>.
        Those curious enough to walk down the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seacoast</ENAMEX> will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, but no likely
        looking landing place for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. Locals shrug and suggest that the
        shoreline‚Äôs topography must have changed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 500 years</TIMEX> since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>.
        Just past the attractive farming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capesterre</ENAMEX>, the
        highway becomes, for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 21‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>), the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">All√</ENAMEX>©e
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dumanoir</ENAMEX>. Twin rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">majestic royal palm trees</ENAMEX> line the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Behind
        them are vast groves of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
        A bit farther along, you‚Äôll certainly want to turn off the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and head up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbet</ENAMEX> falls. First you wind through
        dense banana <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>, then ferns and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree vines</ENAMEX>, and then, as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> narrows to a cement track, the tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foliage</ENAMEX> closes in.
        Civilization here seems very distant. To reach any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Carbet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">falls</ENAMEX>, you must continue walking after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> come to an end for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> respectively. Signs direct you to
        these great waterfalls, which are among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Guadeloupe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest, if least
        visited, scenic attractions.
        Just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">D4</NUMEX>) to the falls is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand-Etang</ENAMEX>, a
        placid lake surrounded by forest with silence broken only by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that occasionally flip out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. It takes
        less than an hour to stroll all the way round the pleasant path
        surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        Back on the coastal highway you won‚Äôt wonder why the
        village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bananier</ENAMEX> has its name. From here to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trois-Rivi√</ENAMEX>®res is one of
        the loveliest drives in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX>. At the lookout point, pull over for an
        inviting panorama of the offshore islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Saintes</ENAMEX>.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trois-Rivi√®res</ENAMEX>, stop to see fascinating rock engravings
        believed carved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,600 years ago</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arawak Indians</ENAMEX>. A delightful
        archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> has been created on the hillside around these huge,
        mysterious rocks. The inscriptions seem to be more than casual
        etchings, but their significance isn‚Äôt known. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> rocks have been
        removed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>; others in the
        Trois-Rivi√®res area outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> have not yet been classified as
        historical monuments by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> will
        tell you where to find them. Brochures in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, available without
        charge, describe the rocks and vegetation.
        Down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">archaeological park</ENAMEX> is a lively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">covered fish</ENAMEX> and vegetable market. From the cement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> here, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>
        leave <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early every morning</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Saintes</ENAMEX>.
        Guadeloupe‚Äôs political capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX>, is much
        smaller and sleepier than <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>. Just passing through, you may
        be reminded of a minor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>, except for its
        magnificent seaside setting at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Soufri√®re‚</ENAMEX>Äôs green
        slopes. The mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Saint-Charles</ENAMEX> dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1645</TIMEX> (since renamed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Louis Delgr√®s</ENAMEX>). If you do stop in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX>, you might like to
        spend some time at the large market just off the capital‚Äôs broad
        shoreline drive.
        From here it‚Äôs all up: through the charming hillside
        village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude</ENAMEX>, with its upper-income <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, and on toward the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summit‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇor</ENAMEX> as far as the gendarmes are allowing traffic to proceed
        that day. The higher you go, the more sulphur you‚Äôll smell; it emanates
        from bubbling fissures in the eerily beautiful landscape. A scenic but
        rather narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> skirts <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Soufri√®re‚Äôs cone and the Carbet</ENAMEX> falls on the
        other side of the volcano. You can drive almost to the crater, but you
        have to climb the final <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">305 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 ft</NUMEX>) to the top (don‚Äôt forget to
        bring along a sweater). On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cloudless days</TIMEX>, a spectacular panorama
        awaits you. But wherever you are on the mountain‚Äôs upper reaches, the
        views are glorious. To appreciate the hiking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> here, an excellent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park</ENAMEX> booklet available in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> can be obtained from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vacillating Volcano</ENAMEX>
        It huffs, puffs, and occasionally even blows a bit. No one
        gets hurt. Practically all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are far out
        of range. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Soufri√®re</ENAMEX>, temperamental and magnificent even if its peak
        is almost always shrouded in clouds, is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äúsemi-active‚</NUMEX>Äù volcano. At
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,467 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4,813 ft</NUMEX>) it dominates the lush and rugged south of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terre</ENAMEX>. When it began acting up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">low-grade ‚Äúvapor explosions‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 1976</TIMEX>, alarming headlines appeared in papers worldwide. Some
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72,000</NUMEX> volcano-zone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> were evacuated at great cost to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. But nothing more happened, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gradually
        returned home. Soufri√®re is a splendid and perfectly safe place to
        visit otherwise the monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> wouldn‚Äôt let you go.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX> north, the leeward coast (c√¥te sous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">le</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vent</ENAMEX>) has a few small beaches of black volcanic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and some
        picturesque paraphernalia of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> who favor these waters.
        Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baillif</ENAMEX> is the best preserved of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>-mill watchtowers
        erected by the famous militant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√®re Labat</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>). It saw
        bloody fighting between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at the beginning of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs prettiest bays is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anse √† la Barque</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boat Cove</ENAMEX>) so-named because fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> have long ridden out storms
        in its protected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anchorage</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Saintes</ENAMEX>
        You might pack a toothbrush as well as your bathing suit if
        you decide on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> excursion to this cluster of little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">islands‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthey‚Äôre</ENAMEX> hard to leave. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">des</ENAMEX>
        Saintes are inhabited, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terre-de-Bas</ENAMEX>, just barely. You‚Äôll land
        at the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terre-de-Haut</ENAMEX>, after a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-minute</TIMEX> small-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> flight
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferries</ENAMEX> also go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terre-de-Bas</ENAMEX>, leaving from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">St-Fran√ßois, Trois-Rivi√®res</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> here, dotted with yachts and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, is

        treat for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">franc</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. And everybody seems to be smiling.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> soon notice that this is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and foremost a
        fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">island‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnets</ENAMEX>, lobster traps, gutting knives, rods, and lines
        are everywhere; it‚Äôs no surprise to learn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, mostly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bretons</ENAMEX> who settled here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years ago</TIMEX>, are considered
        the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX>. Both they and their long bright
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saintois</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> often wear a distinctively
        flat hat known as a salako and don‚Äôt mind being photographed by polite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
        To begin with, you can take a guided minibus tour (local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> generally speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> only), that covers all <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) of
        road on the island. It includes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop Fort Napol√©on</ENAMEX>, unscathed since
        it was built after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Anglo-French</ENAMEX> warfare in the region.
        (Some modern art work is displayed inside. ) On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabrit</ENAMEX> islet across
        the way you‚Äôll see a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> named, inevitably, after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empress Josephine</ENAMEX>.
        After strolling for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> it takes to examine
        the little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, wise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists head</ENAMEX> directly for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pompierre</ENAMEX> beach.
        This might be your idea of paradise: a semicircular sandy strip backed
        by sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>, gentle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aquamarine surf</ENAMEX>, a coral reef
        close to shore, plus some rocks and seaweed for rewarding snorkeling
        and a view out to some huge ‚Äúpierced rocks‚Äù (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roches perc√©es</NUMEX>) that
        partly shelter the entrance to the cove.
        There‚Äôs more shade, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">coconut trees</ENAMEX>, at the delightful
        unnamed beach on the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pain de Sucre</ENAMEX> peninsula across the island.
        Among other beach possibilities is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anse Crawen</ENAMEX>, which is a naturisme
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">haunt</ENAMEX> and said to offer the best off-the-beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">snorkeling</ENAMEX> and skin
        diving. Underwater exploring in the transparent depths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX>
        Saintes archipelago ranges from good to outstanding. For a negotiable
        sum boatmen will take you around the isles, pointing out where the
        great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1782</TIMEX> naval encounter occurred between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleets</ENAMEX>,
        known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Saintes</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terre de Haut</ENAMEX> has several places to stay, but book ahead,
        particularly on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. At the handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, the fare
        unfailingly features the freshest possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>.
        Note: It costs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> times as much to fly to and from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Saintes</ENAMEX> as to make the round-trip sea journey. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boats</ENAMEX> set sail from
        Trois-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rivi√®res</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 km/30 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basse-Terre</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Galante</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La D√</ENAMEX>©sirade
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> won‚Äôt want to take time on a limited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation</TIMEX>
        to visit these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> dependencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>. There are, however,
        regular small-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> flights to both islands and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> by large
        rapid catamarans.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie-Galante</ENAMEX>, large and round and noted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum</ENAMEX> from
        its extensive sugarcane fields, was named by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> after the ship
        that brought him across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> on his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> voyage. The island
        has a number of fine white-sand beaches, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Feuill√®re</ENAMEX> near
        Capesterre, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vieux Fort</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Folle Anse</ENAMEX>. There is also an attractive
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ch√¢teau Murat</ENAMEX>.
        The atmosphere is simple and relaxed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> very kind,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> food excellent (try b√<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">©b√©l√©</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> of
        many ingredients including breadfruit, crabs, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX>).
        Beautiful beaches lure the determined few off the beaten
        path to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La D√©sirade</ENAMEX>, its name signifying yearned-for land. This was the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX> spotted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>. If you like early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nights</ENAMEX> and lazy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, you‚Äôll enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La D√©sirade</ENAMEX>, home to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, but just a few hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>.
        MARTINIQUE
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> called it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madinina</ENAMEX>, island of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and they
        were right: hibiscus and bougainvillaea, magnolia and oleander,
        anthurium, poinsettia, and more, all compete to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinique</ENAMEX> one of
        the most colorful tropical gardens on earth. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> discovered
        the island late in his career, he called it ‚Äúthe best, the most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertile</ENAMEX>, the sweetest, the most charming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the world‚Äù and
        named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">it Matinino</ENAMEX>, probably after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Martin</ENAMEX> (or, some say, as an
        approximation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madinina</ENAMEX>), a name which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> later adapted to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX>.
        This southernmost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies</ENAMEX> lies between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">English-speaking Dominica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Lucia</ENAMEX>. Its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,101 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">425 sq</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) are crowded with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 400,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vibrant</ENAMEX>, generous, and passionate: the loveliness of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique‚Äôs</ENAMEX> women
        is legendary, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> impressive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Empress</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX>, was born here.
        Today, as always, the time-honored occupations of fishing
        and farming support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fragile <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">existence‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe delicious rum</ENAMEX>
        also helps. But as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>, the economic outlook rarely inspires
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complacency</ENAMEX>, even with increasing tourism.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> will most appreciate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> by exploring in
        a rented <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, or, if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> share the cost, a tour by
        regular taxi becomes a reasonable proposition. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>
        and for cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, there are also guided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> excursions
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> attractions by minibus or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort-de-France</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinging</ENAMEX> to its superb harbor, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique‚Äôs</ENAMEX> capital is
        sometimes bustling, sometimes drowsy, but always captivating. Awesome
        green mountains form the backdrop while strikingly tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palm trees</ENAMEX>
        dwarf all but a very few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
        In the great bay where flying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> rise at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk</TIMEX>, sloops and
        ketches, ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">freighters</ENAMEX>, cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>
        never have a parking problem. Ashore it‚Äôs another matter, with
        peak<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-hour</TIMEX> traffic jams and midtown parking woes.
        This is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to savor on foot. Best is the teeming
        shopping area centered on the rue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isambert</ENAMEX> market. In this cavernous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emporium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">you‚</ENAMEX>Äôll have your pick of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Martinique pineapples</ENAMEX>, coconut
        slices, or the pungent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby limes</ENAMEX> so loved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>. Among
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes you‚</ENAMEX>Äôll find bottles of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">old-time</ENAMEX> patent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> for sale. This delightful marketplace has its
        own snack bar featuring a fresh vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">repas</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">meal</TIMEX>) for a relatively
        modest amount by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies</ENAMEX> standards.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> nearby are filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling bright
        material, including the madras prints so typical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX>, ready-made
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clothing</ENAMEX>, shoes, and jewelry. Bargaining here could well be
        worthwhile.
        When you reach the ‚Äúcanal,‚Äù technically the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Levassor River</ENAMEX>
        (the propeller, or h√©lice, was invented by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martiniquais</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX>
        Canque, and tested for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in this rather murky stream),
        you‚Äôll want to cross over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone footbridge</ENAMEX>. Small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> tie up here
        with batches of crayfish, fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and eel, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewives</ENAMEX> clamor
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> to weigh their choices on rudimentary scales. The
        formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> market is farther along the fascinating canalside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All√®gre.</ENAMEX> In this enclosed but airy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> with
        large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machetes</ENAMEX> expertly chopping off hunks of kingfish, tuna, or shark
        for eager <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tourists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Martiniquais</ENAMEX> alike tend to gravitate toward
        the landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Savane</ENAMEX> near the water‚Äôs edge in the heart
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Beyond the outdoor shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilions</ENAMEX> here, you‚Äôll come
        across a white marble statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine</ENAMEX>, holding a rose
        and facing the direction of her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> across the bay. The statue
        was beheaded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX>, who blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine</ENAMEX> for
        her role in the slavery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Belain</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôEsnambuc, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> adventurer who first
        claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, also has a statue here, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">regal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>. Though you‚Äôd never guess it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fought bloody
        battles on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Savane</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>. Near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, note
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX>-style iron grillwork on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
        Alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Savane</ENAMEX> runs rue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Libert√©</ENAMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">No. 9</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Martinique‚Äôs excellent Mus√©e d√©partemental</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stories of
        this little air-conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> you can see displays of prehistoric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> artifacts, skeletal bones found locally, and a wealth of items
        chosen to evoke a feeling for the island‚Äôs history over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine</ENAMEX> get top billing, of course, as does
        the eruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Pel√©e</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>). There are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> irons,
        traditional island costumes, and an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> map of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1778</TIMEX>
        showing the th√©√¢tre <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> guerre (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> of war) between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is open from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9am</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1pm and 2 to 5pm Monday</TIMEX>
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> (with audio-visual shows in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX>), and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>.
        Farther along <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Libert√</ENAMEX>© is the startling Schoelcher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">biblioth√®que</ENAMEX>). This odd but attractive town-house, with its
        collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arawak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carib</ENAMEX> relics, was on display at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Exposition</ENAMEX>, then dismantled, brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinique</ENAMEX>, and reconstructed.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Schoelcher</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">philanthropist</ENAMEX> who donated most of the library‚Äôs
        books, is credited with abolishing slavery here. Another midtown
        landmark in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint-Louis Cathedral</ENAMEX>, which
        dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>.
        You‚Äôll have to confine your viewing to the outside of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old citadel</ENAMEX> in the harbor, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Saint-Louis</ENAMEX>, unless you‚Äôre able to
        obtain special visitor‚Äôs permission from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> military (true of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">infrequent‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚</ENAMEX>Äúvisiting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. ‚Äù In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> this fort was all
        there was to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX> were gradually built up around it
        on reclaimed marshland. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, which held off a savage <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> attack
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1674</TIMEX>, was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>, later corrupted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foyal</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> named it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and that name was taken over for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>. Fires and hurricanes during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last century</TIMEX> subsequently reduced
        its importance. Had it not been for the volcanic disaster that all but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wiped Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX> off the map in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> would never have
        become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique‚</ENAMEX>Äôs leading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        Venture Into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior</ENAMEX>
        If you have time for only one road trip on the island, be
        sure it includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Route de la Trace</ENAMEX>, more prosaically known as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Route</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Nationale 3</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Trace</ENAMEX> is one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, with
        gorgeous views down into ravines and up at the deep green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbet</ENAMEX> peaks
        that dominate north-central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX>. Along the way, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Donis</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nurseries</ENAMEX> which sell local foliage

        Caution: Unlike other islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> has poisonous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, and walking off a marked forest trail
        is not recommended.
        For that out-of-this-world feeling and superior tropical
        mountain scenery, try first gear on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fond Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denis</ENAMEX>.
        Precipitous turns lead to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Paris</ENAMEX>,
        strategically perched to monitor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pel√</ENAMEX>©e volcano. To visit this
        establishment, which resembles a private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. you must make
        arrangements <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> in advance. Up here, gazing out at strikingly
        lush mountains, you may find yourself higher than the clouds, which
        adds to the extraordinarily eerie atmosphere of the place.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volcano</ENAMEX>
        It was a lovely seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> settlement
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX>, and, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1902</TIMEX>, so culturally and economically
        thriving that it was nicknamed the ‚ÄúParis of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù When
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,397-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,584</NUMEX>-ft) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Pel√©e</ENAMEX> began belching smoke and cinders far
        above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late April</TIMEX>, which it had done harmlessly before,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> professed no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. Evacuation was unthinkable since an
        election was coming up.
        On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4‚Äì5</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> a mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> and rocks was swept down by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pel√©e‚Äôs White River</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rivi√®re Blanche</ENAMEX>) over a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. At the same time, a tidal wave lashed the shores near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX>. Flames began spouting from the mountain‚Äôs peak. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> May
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinique</ENAMEX> arrived with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> to calm the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">residents‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇSaint-Pierre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30,000</NUMEX>.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:02am</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8 May</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pel√</ENAMEX>©e erupted titanically. A vast
        burning cloud of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and steam bearing rocks and ashes roared down the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mountainside</ENAMEX> onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just three minutes</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX> was
        totally wiped out. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> in a thick-walled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dungeon</ENAMEX>, who for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> afterwards was displayed abroad as a circus
        attraction. He didn‚Äôt die until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>.
        The eruption of the volcano is documented in the excellent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franck Perret</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Perret</ENAMEX> lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929 to 1943</TIMEX>.
        Perched near the crater during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1929</TIMEX> eruption, he studied the
        composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Pel√©e‚Äôs volcanic gases</ENAMEX>, then founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> that he
        donated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">municipality</ENAMEX>. He died in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> shortly after leaving
        the island.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>-, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spanish-speaking</ENAMEX> guides at the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> help explain the sobering display of relics of the once
        lively <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Particularly graphic are blown-up old photographs, a
        burned and twisted sewing machine, and a mass of scissors soldered
        together by the intense heat. One curiosity is a charred electric light
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fixture</ENAMEX> and bulb that somehow continued to work for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62 years</TIMEX> until it
        suddenly stopped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day in 1964</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
        (including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX>) from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9am</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5pm</TIMEX>.
        Just outside, glance over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon parapet</ENAMEX> for a view of
        the remains of devastated beachside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 915</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 yards</NUMEX>)
        up the street you‚Äôll see the ruins of what was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Pierre‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">glittering</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> and, nearby, the rubble of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX>.
        Today <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX> is a little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 6,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
        If you ask, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> will probably concede that they always worry a
        little about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúthat mountain‚Äù</ENAMEX> up there, but since the minor eruption in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX> there has been no smoke and only occasional earth rumblings.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far North</ENAMEX>
        History <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> will have to ask along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> north of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX> for the unmarked location of the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúCaribs‚Äô‚</ENAMEX>Äô
        Grave,‚Äù where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> pursued by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonists</ENAMEX> hurled themselves
        from a cliff in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>, vowing that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Pel√</ENAMEX>©e would avenge
        their deaths. Farther on is the unassuming village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Pr√™cheur</ENAMEX>,
        where another island <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> who made good spent her childhood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">years‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇMadame de Maintenon</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX>. Beyond Le
        Pr√™cheur you‚Äôll go through the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anse Belleville</ENAMEX> with a
        remarkably tall, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fig tree</ENAMEX> and a nice little beach.
        The coast here is all but uninhabited. Normally you‚Äôll
        find no one at all on the delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">volcanic sand</ENAMEX> beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anse C√©ron.</ENAMEX>
        This idyllic spot is as far as you should attempt to drive‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe
        tropical track ahead will defeat most <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>.
        Instead, to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique‚</ENAMEX>Äôs northernmost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand-Rivi√®re</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macouba</ENAMEX>, drive inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre</ENAMEX>, skirting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Pel√©e.</ENAMEX> This route takes you through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morne Rouge</ENAMEX> and Ajoupa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bouillon</ENAMEX>. Driving in this region, as elsewhere, you may be surprised to
        see brightly painted tires hanging outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. These are only for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decoration</ENAMEX> and not intended to ward off ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Äúevil spirits‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇvolcanic</ENAMEX> or
        otherwise. For such purposes, some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Martiniquais</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> to different
        means.
        As you reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll become almost
        engulfed in vast groves of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, with bunches hanging
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temptingly</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. But it‚Äôs best to steer clear of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groves</ENAMEX> because they harbor a poisonous snake called the fer de
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lance</ENAMEX>.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macouba</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs worth stopping at the simple cliffside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P√®re Labat</ENAMEX> spent some time, to examine its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>
        jutting out over the ocean. The lively little fishing settlement far
        below on the water‚Äôs edge is an easy walk down, but very tiring coming
        back up on a hot day. If you do descend, you‚Äôll see some rather curious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caverns</ENAMEX> in the limestone cliffs where, on occasion, local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sing
        and dance to stringed instruments.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persevering</ENAMEX> along the bumpy cobblestone road with its
        hairpin bends <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> cross <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> green, modern, metal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>. Then you
        arrive at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand-Rivi√®re</ENAMEX>. This end-of-the-road <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is famed for its
        skilled and dauntless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> probably see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> surfing the
        high, somewhat dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> waves on the smooth trunks of balsa
        (langue de b≈ìuf) <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. This lightweight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, cut to the size of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy intending</ENAMEX> to use it, makes unexpectedly good surfboards.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Pierre</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
        Just off the gray sand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anse Turin</ENAMEX> beach near Le <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carbet</ENAMEX>, a
        roadside sign reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gauguin</ENAMEX> sojourned here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l887</TIMEX>. The
        sign points through an arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX> of crumbling stone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√</ENAMEX>©e
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gauguin</ENAMEX>, displaying some original works by the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>,
        though only copies of his paintings. Also in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Carbet</ENAMEX>: the Amazona
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Zoological Garden</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alligator</ENAMEX>-like caimans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">armadillos</ENAMEX>, and
        other delights.
        Farther down the coast road you‚Äôll come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        most-photographed fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bellefontaine</ENAMEX>, with a beach
        cluttered with nets and the distinctive gommier fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> invented
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carib Indians</ENAMEX>. Schoelcher, formerly a small fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> just
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north of Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, has expanded to become an extension of the
        capital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Named after the abolitionist, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schoelcher</ENAMEX> is proud of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstructed Benedictine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">inland road</ENAMEX> through the
        agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gros Morne</ENAMEX> meanders over hills
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thickly</ENAMEX> planted with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pineapple</ENAMEX>, and sugarcane. You won‚Äôt envy
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> you see working in the fields under the blazing sun,
        but they‚Äôre never too tired to return your wave with a smile. At
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Joseph</ENAMEX> ask to be shown a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútraveler‚Äôs tree‚Äù</ENAMEX> (arbre du voyageur)
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madagascar</ENAMEX>, which has a reserve supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> within its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trunk</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South</ENAMEX> Along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
        By any standards, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trois-Ilets</ENAMEX> seems an unlikely hometown
        for an empress. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is named after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small islands it
        overlooks in a corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort-de-France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs huge bay. Don‚Äôt miss the
        neatly white-washed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> with a pale blue ceiling above its cool
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX>. Here Josephine‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were married and she was baptized,
        though the plaque notes merely that the village celebrated the 100th
        anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 May 1921</TIMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> away in the unspoiled countryside,
        you‚Äôll jolt over the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 rockiest yards</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique</ENAMEX> to get to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mus√©e de la Pagerie</ENAMEX>. Contained in the restored <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and prayer
        room of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Josephine‚Äôs</ENAMEX> family estate, the tidy little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is a shrine
        to the one-time empress. You‚Äôll see period furniture, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>, and
        old paintings, but the greatest attractions are a photocopy of Napoleon
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Josephine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs wedding certificate and an emotional love letter he
        wrote her in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1796</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> (an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> translation is displayed).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX> will shyly tell you that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to this out-of-the-way
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memorial</ENAMEX> have included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Margrethe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leopold</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady Clementine Churchill</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</ENAMEX>.
        (Also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trois</ENAMEX>-Ilets: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sugarcane Museum</ENAMEX>. )
        Just down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> lie the rolling
        fairways of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Martinique‚Äôs 18-hole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>, and a little farther on,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">du</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bout</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> with its cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, beaches, and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marina</ENAMEX>. If you continue by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> around this most attractive peninsula,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> notice several secluded little coves scooped out of the often
        steep coastline. By <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or ferry from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, you can reach
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Anse √† l‚ÄôAne</ENAMEX> which has a pleasant brown-sand beach with sea grapes
        providing shade, plus picnic tables, children‚Äôs slides, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        Even better is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Anses-d‚ÄôArlet</ENAMEX>, as delightful a village
        as there is anywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies</ENAMEX>. You may have to share
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fine little beaches with a few cheerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> here is usually placid and always inviting, and the
        atmosphere is utterly relaxed, the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> quiet and clean.
        Motorboats from the capital will bring you out here in record time.
        After a stop to contemplate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Diamond Rock</ENAMEX> (see box below),
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> continue south over winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sainte</ENAMEX>-Luce,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivi√®re-Pilote</ENAMEX>, and Le <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marin</ENAMEX> without stopping until they reach
        Sainte-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX>. The best beach, one of the best on the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, is
        nearby, fronting a private vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club</ENAMEX>. The beach is public property,
        but anyone can simply walk there from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sainte-Anne</ENAMEX>. The neighboring
        public beach, perfectly acceptable, has, unfortunately, very little
        shade. (Though the equator is only a mite closer here in the rather
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arid</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX>, the sun does seem hotter. )
        Having reached <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sainte-Anne</ENAMEX>, you should certainly drive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX> for perhaps <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX>, as far as the road permits, to the
        string of beautiful, deserted beaches known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Salines</ENAMEX>. Take your
        lunch; this is wild, far-out <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> with no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> of any kind, although some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> keep <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> here
        permanently for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> camping. The area is named after the large salt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pond</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll see.
        This is also the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">strange‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut</ENAMEX> a little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disappointing‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚Äúpetrified savanna forest‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la savanne des</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p√©trifications</ENAMEX>), rather difficult to reach over rutted automobile
        trails of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> and sand. Here, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far</NUMEX> south as you can go on
        Martinique, the landscape is desolate. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cacti</ENAMEX> seem able to grow
        amid bleak rocks that on inspection turn out to be petrified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs
        speculated that aeons ago this may have been a forest extinguished by
        the eruption of some volcano now deep under the sea.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Coast</ENAMEX>
        Much of the rugged windward coast is accessible only by
        boat. The only worthwhile beach area is near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tartane</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX>island
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caravelle</ENAMEX> peninsula, where there‚Äôs also a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with walking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>.
        You‚Äôll enjoy visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Vauclin</ENAMEX>, a consummate fishing
        village with more than its share of friendly, weatherbeaten <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
        Much evidence of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carib Indian</ENAMEX> settlement has been unearthed in
        this region.
        The views of the whole of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Martinique</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount</ENAMEX>
        Vauclin are spectacular.
        Up the coast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Fran√</ENAMEX>ßois is a curious blend of typical
        wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment buildings</ENAMEX> spreading down toward a
        pretty bay and a lazy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX>. The nearby, historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhum Cl√</ENAMEX>©ment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distillery</ENAMEX> offers tours and tastings.
        Sainte-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marie</ENAMEX> houses a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rum Museum</ENAMEX> with documents and
        equipment going back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1765</TIMEX>, as well as a fascinating new ‚ÄúBanana
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Martin</ENAMEX>
        It‚Äôs an island with a dual personality, each side trying
        to outsmile the other. Whatever you call it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        do, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sint Maarten</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, it is part of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> West
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indies</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands‚Äô Antilles</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbus</ENAMEX> named the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Martin</ENAMEX> on that saint‚Äôs
        feast day in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>, or did he? Given the inexact state of the geography
        along the confusing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antilles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> suggest that he
        actually gave the name to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nevis</ENAMEX>, an island to the south, and that
        subsequent cartographers somehow awarded it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX>. The
        similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Matinino‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇMartinique‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇonly confuses things more.
        Certainly this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> can qualify as having one of the
        world‚Äôs longest-running governmental love affairs: since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1648</TIMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> have shared sovereignty in almost total harmony.
        When the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> divided it up, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> got <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">54 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 sq miles</NUMEX>)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> agreed to take just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">41 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 sq miles</NUMEX>), but that
        included the important salt pond near the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> capital of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philipsburg</ENAMEX>.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> was accomplished by
        having a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frenchman</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dutchman</ENAMEX> start back to back pacing off
        territory: some say the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frenchman</ENAMEX> got more of the island because he had
        a longer stride, or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutchman</ENAMEX> stopped too often for a snort of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>. )
        Another thing those early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> agreed
        upon was that their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> should be free of levies on any imported
        goods. That still means completely duty-free shopping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and
        therefore, together with nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saint-Barth√©lemy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caribbean‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        lowest prices for many items (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX>).
        Theoretically there should be a frontier hut, but there
        isn‚Äôt a single customs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> and the border has been unguarded for
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years</TIMEX>. On the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll know you‚Äôve passed crossed
        over by a stone monument commemorating the partition and signs reading
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bienvenue Partie Fran√</ENAMEX>ßaise in one direction, ‚ÄúWelcome to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sint Maarten‚</ENAMEX>Äô‚Äô
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">other‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthat‚</ENAMEX>Äôs all. (Before the island‚Äôs telephone service was
        boldly upgraded, it used to be easier to drive across the border than
        to put through a call to the other side. ) So near, yet worlds apart,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> maintain their separate identities: the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> side,
        despite such hold-outs as thin cigars, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rijstafel</ENAMEX>,
        has begun to resemble an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> beachhead, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of landings by
        hordes of cruise-ship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>.
        On the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> side of the island, a sub-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">prefecture</ENAMEX> of
        Guadeloupe, every schoolchild learns the mother tongue. There is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Creole patois</ENAMEX>, heavily influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX>, but it‚Äôs
        essentially based on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. Here, on the northernmost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find such familiar trappings as boulangeries, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
        featuring delicate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine sauces</ENAMEX>, and gendarmes (if only a mere handful).
        Around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> side, the same amount on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch</ENAMEX>.
        Marigot
        Whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch Sint Maarten</ENAMEX> is one of the more upbeat
        places in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> side‚Äôs charm is that it
        seems content to slumber in the sun. Marigot, the modest capital on its
        wide bay, is so quiet that very large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX> in surprisingly
        close to shore. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also see plenty of yachts, but cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>
        rarely enter; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philipsburg</ENAMEX> gets nearly all of them.
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marigot</ENAMEX> livens up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the day</TIMEX> at the quayside,
        you‚Äôll want to be there. Like their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupean</ENAMEX> and Martiniquais
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Martin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> invariably chug <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with their
        catches to a clamorous welcome. Nearby, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> with broad smiles sit on
        little stools selling breadfruit and cinnamon. Things become almost
        chaotic, by Marigot standards, when an inter-island cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">scow</ENAMEX> arrives
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">haphazardly tethered livestock</ENAMEX> and straw-hatted voyagers.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> hav e a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fort</ENAMEX>, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> have a fort. For the
        view over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marigot Bay</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs worth the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four-minute</TIMEX> climb up to deserted
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Saint-Louis</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 17th-century</TIMEX> bastion looks its age and then
        some. Sheep graze alongside a rusty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disused cannon</ENAMEX>, standard armament
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FWI</ENAMEX> forts.
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A few minutes</TIMEX> up and over the hill by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Case</ENAMEX>, a
        delightful village strung unpretentiously along a long, curving beach.
        Much smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marigot</ENAMEX> and even lower-key, it has numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> and places to stay. At salt flats nearby is tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esp√</ENAMEX>©rance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">airport</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-strip, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-shed affair used for flights to and from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pointe-√†-Pitre and Saint-Barth√©lemy</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaches</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX>
        Counting little coves you‚Äôll reach only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint-Martin</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> beaches of fine, sometimes dazzling white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> located on some of the best. Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde lead</ENAMEX> of
        big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> has introduced a nudist beach.
        Elsewhere on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> side of the island, toplessness is
        optional.
        Churning or serene, deep blue or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aquamarine</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is
        clear and clean. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkeling</ENAMEX> and skin diving are particularly rewarding
        at a number of isolated inlets and nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">islets</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> to take you
        there are readily available. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1801</TIMEX> wreck of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> warship on a
        reef <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) offshore is a diver‚Äôs dream: for the non-scuba set
        there‚Äôs a glass-bottomed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> you can take to see big groupers and
        perhaps sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> swimming around the sunken <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cannon</ENAMEX>.
        Sailboats of various sizes are offered for rent around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beginners</ENAMEX> appreciate the calm waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Simson Bay</ENAMEX>, the largest
        lagoon in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>. Old salts may want to skipper their charter
        craft across open sea to the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sint Eustatius</ENAMEX> or
        Saba, or to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Saint-Barth√©lemy.</ENAMEX> If you don‚Äôt ‚Äúdo-it-yourself‚Äù
        there‚Äôs a choice of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> group excursions by motor launch or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sailboat</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotels</ENAMEX> will be able to arrange for deep-sea fishing and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waterskiing</ENAMEX>.
        Touring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Island</ENAMEX>
        Without seriously disrupting the leisurely pace of your
        vacation, you can see the highlights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Martin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>,
        breaking for a swim and a relaxed lunch. There‚Äôs a great deal of
        pastureland with stone walls. Traffic can be heavy, though; count on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marigot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philipsburg</ENAMEX>. Rental car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> offer
        descriptive tape cassettes for your own guided tour; otherwise,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> run bus tours and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are pleased to drive you
        around.
        Probably the most exciting things to see on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> are
        other islands. Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philipsburg</ENAMEX> from a roadside lookout point you‚Äôll
        make out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> islands rising out of the sea in the distance: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        Kitts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sint Eustatius</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saba</ENAMEX>. More dramatically, from the high,
        serpentine road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oyster Pond</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philipsburg</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll be stunned by
        the beauty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Barth√©lemy</ENAMEX> across a royal blue swath of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint-Barth√</ENAMEX>©lemy
        This just might be the best piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> anywhere.
        Known fondly as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúSt</ENAMEX>. Barts,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">‚Äù Columbus</ENAMEX> bestowed his brother‚Äôs name,
        Bartholomew, on the island when he sailed past in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>. It‚Äôs an
        absolutely peaceful, absolutely beautiful little island of roller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coaster hills</ENAMEX>, rocky coves, and powdery beaches lining a limpid,
        emerald sea.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twittering</ENAMEX> in the shrubbery of its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 sq miles</NUMEX>)
        are countless <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of yellow-breasts, red-throats, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hummingbirds</ENAMEX>. They greatly outnumber the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,500</NUMEX>-odd human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhabitants‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmostly</ENAMEX> white, many the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Huguenots‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇfrom
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brittany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy</ENAMEX>.
        These unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Frenchmen</ENAMEX> and the relative handful of black
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that have also lived here for generations strike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> as
        extremely kind, open, and simple. Among themselves they speak a nasal,
        old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, accented in a way that reminds visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parisians</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> speech. Sprinkled through it are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">bits</NUMEX> of English and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX>. (For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century</TIMEX>, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1878</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Barts</ENAMEX> was the only
        possession <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> ever had in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>. ) The result
        is a patois baffling to anyone not brought up on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Barts</ENAMEX>.
        Now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has a modern international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are making their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Barts</ENAMEX> in ever-increasing numbers.
        Swelling the ranks of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> are trendy young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frenchmen</ENAMEX>
        from the m√©tropole. They like the relaxed, low-key atmosphere and
        Gallic flair of the place. The tourist influx has triggered a building
        boom around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and in the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gustavia</ENAMEX>, situated on
        a picture-postcard harbor. Some new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have opened, but so far, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barts</ENAMEX> has lost little of its former charm.
        The most popular way to get there is by scheduled flight
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX>. Unless you arrive by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX>, the other
        option is a motor-launch ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</NUMEX>ÄÇsometimes very
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">choppy‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnautical miles</NUMEX> away.
        Gustavia
        When you see it, you‚Äôll understand why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gustavia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        rectangular harbor is a favorite with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> yachting set. From
        this ideal anchorage you can rent small excursion or fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Caution: Owing</ENAMEX> to the risk of ciguatera in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</NUMEX>), you‚Äôd be wise to check with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> before eating any fish
        you catch in offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</TIMEX> you can get to know just about everybody in
        this unassuming island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedes</ENAMEX> named it after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gustav</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1785</TIMEX>, declared it the free <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> that it remains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX> is therefore duty-free, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86</NUMEX>).
        Liquor and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> are good buys. There are also several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>
        boutiques that stock merchandise from the Continent, though the
        selection of items for sale is rather limited.
        When sightseeing, you‚Äôll find the two thriving churches
        somewhat more interesting than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ruined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forts</ENAMEX> overlooking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gustavia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Barts</ENAMEX>, of course, is completely undefended. But then this
        very particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is hardly in danger of being invaded except, of
        course, by tourism.
        Around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Island</ENAMEX>
        Sightseers have their choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> or rental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>,
        including the ubiquitous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minimoke</ENAMEX> and beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buggy</ENAMEX>, ideal for local
        conditions. To spend more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> covering every paved and
        unpaved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, most of which terminate in unannounced dead ends, would
        be a difficult task. If you‚Äôre stranded anywhere, hitch-hiking is
        accepted behavior and you‚Äôll surely get a ride. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> the
        number of motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Barts</ENAMEX> has escalated to something like
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> per inhabitant.
        The seascapes and panoramas on this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> are enough to
        tempt any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> to glance away from the serviceable but
        never-wide-enough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. From the highest point on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vitet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>,
        you‚Äôll want to stop to take in the sweeping view over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bay</ENAMEX> called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grand-Cul-de-Sac</ENAMEX>, which is favored by windsurfers, and out to Tortue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">islet</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. Not far away is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pointe Milou</ENAMEX>, a wild,
        breathtaking headland from which on a clear day you can count <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isles</ENAMEX> or rocks in the sea. The strange cactus-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> growing here
        in great profusion are called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T√™te-√†-l‚ÄôAnglais</ENAMEX>. They have prominent red
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protuberances</ENAMEX> and may have been named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> redcoats.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French West Indies</ENAMEX> may be matriarchal, but on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        Barts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Practically everyone goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> either on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, when mass
        is celebrated at different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worth going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> or
        visiting the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corossol</ENAMEX> just to see the ladies wearing
        the starched white bonnets called quichenottes, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Barts‚Äô</ENAMEX> trademark
        that dates back to the time of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Huguenot</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX>.
        Beaches
        The very best are difficult to get to, as is often the
        case with superior beaches in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Coconut trees</ENAMEX> and sloping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cliffs</ENAMEX> ring the tranquil waters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Grand Colombier</ENAMEX>. This northern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beach</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">magnificent tan sand</ENAMEX> is most agreeably reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>.
        Otherwise, if the road gives out, you‚Äôll have to walk for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> an
        hour to this paradise bay, which a noted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">David</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX>, chose as the site of his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> also took up residence nearby.
        Very bumpy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> will take you almost as far as the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-best beaches, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gouverneur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grande Saline</ENAMEX>, in
        neighboring coves on the south coast. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> provide
        little shade here, but otherwise you should find no fault with either
        of these shores. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that treasure lies buried hereabouts,
        hidden away by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buccaneer</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Montbars the Exterminator</ENAMEX>.
        Access to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Baie de Saint-Jean</ENAMEX>, the most-photographed of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saint-Barth√©lemy‚Äôs 22</ENAMEX> beaches, is quite easy. There are actually two
        shimmering crescents of pale <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> here, separated by a small rocky
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promontory</ENAMEX>.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corossol, Anse des Cayes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anse de Lorient</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll
        share the shore with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> who set out to sea in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gaily</TIMEX> painted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boats</ENAMEX>.
        Currents can be surprisingly strong at the attractive
        Flamands <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beach‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnot</ENAMEX> recommended for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or poor swimmers. At many
        points around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Barts</ENAMEX> and its small rocky offshore islets, there is
        fine reef snorkeling.
