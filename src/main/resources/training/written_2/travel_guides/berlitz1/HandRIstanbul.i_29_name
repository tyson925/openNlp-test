        Finding accommodation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX> is rarely a problem, as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has recently seen a boom in the hotel business. However, if
        you want a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, it is best to book, especially
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> areas are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laleli, Aksaray</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sultanahmet</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old City</ENAMEX>, and around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taksim Square</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beyoâ€˜lu.</ENAMEX>
        Intense competition among the middle-range <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> means that you can
        often bargain for a lower rate, especially if you plan to stay for more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two nights</TIMEX>.
        As a basic guide we have used the symbols below to indicate
        prices for a double <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with bath, including breakfast:
