        A mere speck in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>, Madeira
        has all the elements of a mysterious dream world. The volcanic island
        is thickly draped with vegetation, a colorful riot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and fruit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Rugged mountains peek through the clouds, and microclimates
        hover over isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. Spectacular cliffs crash <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of feet</NUMEX>
        below to the deep blue surf.
        Even though foreign invaders stormed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeira</ENAMEX> was discovered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only a few decades</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> made
        his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. Though part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> since the
        great expedition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> claimed it for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">King Jo√£o I</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearer</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>. It lies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">375 miles</NUMEX>) off
        the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 1,000 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
        Formed from volcanic eruptions many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>,
        Madeira, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>, is an archipelago. The land is like
        an iceberg; massive mountains poke through the clouds, forming the mere
        tip of a submerged mass. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhabited‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> little known, arid, and much flatter holiday hideaway
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Santo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Santo</ENAMEX> in the second
        half of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, marrying the local governor‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>.
        Few places on earth can rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs wealth of natural
        gifts, especially in so small an area. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is blanketed with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> of paradise, their beak-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> bright orange,
        blossom in open fields. Fragrant hydrangeas line walking paths skirting
        the edges of mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">terraces</ENAMEX>. Private and public gardens burst with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX>, bougainvillea, and jacarandas, while orchards heave with
        mangoes, passion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, watermelons, and avocados.
        In the mountains, water streams down from unseen springs: a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> walk might take you past <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> waterfalls. The cold
        waters around the island, once prime whaling territory, are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a
        marine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whales</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dolphins</ENAMEX>, and seals. And all of this in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">year-round</ENAMEX> sub-tropical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> weather with a southerly breeze and
        temperatures averaging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22¬∫</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">17¬∫ C</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> seems much larger than its diminutive size, just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 miles</NUMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 miles</NUMEX>) wide. The terrain is so
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountainous</ENAMEX>, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> so tortuous, that distances are magnified in
        terms of both time and effort. This can breed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insularity</ENAMEX>; some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> have never been as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> and the thought of making
        the long trip to the mainland is even more remote. Yet young and
        upwardly mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> do go off in search of fortune, and the most
        successful return from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> to build
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sumptuous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">villas</ENAMEX> overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay of Funchal</ENAMEX>.
        Madeira, alas, is no simple portrait of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gauguin</ENAMEX>-like
        tropical paradise. With a history of emigration and return, of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">welcoming</ENAMEX> visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and seafarers, and, during a brief period
        of occupation, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> are a
        cosmopolitan mix. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX> is an engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stew</ENAMEX> of dark North
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexions</ENAMEX> and blonde, blue-eyed northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>.
        Funchal, the island‚Äôs capital, major harbor, and only city
        of any note, merely hints at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs riches. The capital‚Äôs white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX> and tile roofs are clustered on picturesque hills sloping down
        to a steep bay, which makes for a pretty picture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is
        undeniably pleasant, but its noise and traffic don‚Äôt seem so far
        removed from the more conveniently located places most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come here
        to avoid. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">270,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live in Funchal
        (pronounced ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúfoon-shawl‚Äù</NUMEX>), and cruise-ship <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> stride ashore
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> for a frenzied flurry of sightseeing and shopping. Other visitors
        kick back in luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> crowding the city‚Äôs western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seafront</ENAMEX>. In
        recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> a gleaming new high-rise zona turista has sprung up to
        confront the old-world <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and distinguished quintas (rural estates)
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs more peaceful past.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> is less the sum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma¬≠deira</ENAMEX>, though, than a gateway
        to the rest of the island, whose real charms begin in the hillsides
        just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> outside of town. Spectac¬≠ular gardens, like the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Botanic Garden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Palheiro</ENAMEX>, are only a short bus or taxi
        ride from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
        Small-scale agriculture dominates the island‚Äôs land¬≠scape,
        employing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a fifth</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬≠De¬≠pend¬≠ing</ENAMEX> on the altitude and
        wheth¬≠er you happen to be on the warm south coast or the marginally
        cooler <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX>, you will see terraces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> and vines that
        produce the grapes for fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Madeira wine</ENAMEX>. There are windswept
        mountain peaks, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">craggy cliffs</ENAMEX> that plummet to the sea, and emerald
        valleys that could be stand-ins for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>. From
        strategically situated lookout points (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mira¬≠douros</ENAMEX>) you can take in
        these magical panoramas and look down upon <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> carved out of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountains</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> so isolated it only began to receive TV signals
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>.
        Driving a car along the hairpin curves on mountain roads
        and coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, getting sprayed by waterfalls and constantly
        rewarded with spectacular vistas can be an exhilarating experience, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> is best viewed by getting out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> and exploring
        on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two feet</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is heaven for anyone who enjoys being outside,
        whether your taste runs to gentle walks or hardcore hiking. Madeira‚Äôs
        system of irrigation channels, known as levadas, carries water down
        from the mountains on gentle gradients and provides a ready-made system
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">canals‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmore</ENAMEX> than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,300 miles</NUMEX> of them crisscross the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">island‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇhave level footpaths running along their entire length.
        Walkers of all ages and abilities need only find a levada to take in
        some of the finest countryside anywhere. Several of these walks, which
        will be discussed in this book, are among the highlights of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>.
        With such rapturous scenery and a climate that is
        consistently delightful, perhaps it would be unfair to expect nature to
        have bestowed the island with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of perfect sands as well. Madeira
        has no beaches to speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">of‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthough <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> when an enterprising hotel
        builds its own man-made beach can‚Äôt be too far off. In the meantime, if
        a lounge chair by the pool just can‚Äôt compare, you‚Äôll have to follow in
        the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> on the neighboring island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Santo</ENAMEX>,
        a popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> trip.
        The only other inhabited island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">archipelago</ENAMEX>, Porto
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santo</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9-km-long</NUMEX> beach running the length of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south coast</ENAMEX>, but
        few other attractions. While some surely would find the notion of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX> vacation with no beach time an unusual prospect indeed, perhaps
        it isn‚Äôt at all a tragedy that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Madeira‚Äôs</ENAMEX> shoreline crashes so violently
        into the ocean. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX> with sandy beaches and direct flights from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> and other points in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> (and beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2000</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America</ENAMEX>) would surely not have been capable of staving off the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX>-tourist market as it has thus far. Lack of sand has kept Madeira
        from modeling itself after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> has instead attracted a genteel, even
        anachronistic form of island tourism. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and black-tie
        dinners are still served at the most elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. The typical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visitor</ENAMEX> is still older and wealthier than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most holiday</TIMEX> destinations,
        but times are beginning to change‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇas they are across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, no
        longer the forgotten backwater of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Funchal‚Äôs new tourist zone
        testifies to local travel industry ambitions. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> Madeira is being
        discovered by younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> who might also indulge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spas</ENAMEX> and
        dining that world-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer, but are just as likely to seek
        out the modest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> up in the mountains and strap on their boots for
        serious hiking.
        Madeirans, like most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, are a generally quiet and
        reserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Add to this geographical isolation and the
        difficulties for most of a harsh agricultural existence (where few have
        the machinery to help in the tiny terraced fields), and you might
        forgive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> if they seemed less than welcoming.
        Instead you will find friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who, in spite of a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-month season</TIMEX> that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> has deposited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> from wealthier
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX> on their shores, are refreshingly hospitable. They are proud of
        the scenic beauty, delectable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, and exquisite hand embroidery that
        their tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has become rightly famous for.
        The tourism ante is being upped by hoteliers,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entre¬≠pren¬≠eurs</ENAMEX>, and government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> eager to broaden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        offerings and appeal. But the allure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> remains its absence of
        man-made attractions and abundance of natural ones. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still
        suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> is part of the lost continent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atlantis</ENAMEX>, and
        though it has become easier and easier to get there, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> still
        seems otherworldly.
