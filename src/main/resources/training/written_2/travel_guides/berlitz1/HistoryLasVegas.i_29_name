        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early Habitation</ENAMEX>
        The inhabited history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas Valley</ENAMEX> stretches to
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">23,000 b.c.</NUMEX> , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake.
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX>, the indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lived in caves, hunting the
        mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley
        changed dramatically over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 200 centuries</TIMEX>. The glaciers feeding
        the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure
        story of man‚Äôs slow and sporadic development.
        Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> b.c. , <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Archaic Indians</ENAMEX> began to develop a
        lasting hunting and gathering culture. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, the valley was in
        much the same geographic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> as it exists in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, with one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exception‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the
        surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams
        draining through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas Wash</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado River</ENAMEX>. The areas
        surrounding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the springs</TIMEX> were desert oases: sprawling collections of
        grasses, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX>. Many springs lay in areas that would
        eventually become the center of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> metropolis.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 4000 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaics</ENAMEX> thrived in a culture that
        included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advancement</ENAMEX> appeared halfway through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first millennium a.d.</TIMEX> , when
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anasazi Indians</ENAMEX> inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the
        Archaics, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anasazi</ENAMEX> utilized such formal agricultural techniques as
        irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anasazi</ENAMEX> to
        achieve a benchmark of advanced society‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe ability to live in
        permanent shelters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-round</TIMEX> without need to follow wildlife.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mysteriously</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anasazi</ENAMEX> vanished from the valley around a.d. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1150</TIMEX>,
        leaving it to be repopulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Paiutes</ENAMEX>, another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hunter</ENAMEX>-gatherer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>.
        Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the
        Anasazi, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paiutes</ENAMEX> were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> arrived, changing the nature of existence in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley</ENAMEX> forever.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mailmen</ENAMEX> to Mormons
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early nineteenth century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America‚</ENAMEX>Äôs western
        territories were still largely unexplored. It was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1829</TIMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Rivera</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scout</ENAMEX>, found a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>-fed valley and dubbed it
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Vegas‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Äî‚ÄÇa Spanish</ENAMEX> name that leaves many modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> wondering
        exactly where ‚Äúthe meadows‚Äù really lay.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifteen years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> was used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish Trail</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1844</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">explorer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Fremont</ENAMEX> parked his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Big Springs</ENAMEX>, and his report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> resulted in a
        mail route leading past the spot on its way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>. This put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its
        history.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1855</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormon</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham Young</ENAMEX> responded to promising
        reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> by sending <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> missionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> to the valley;
        they eventually built a fort not far from today‚Äôs Downtown. Surrounded
        by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of farmland hewn from the hard desert, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adobe fort</ENAMEX> became a
        focal point for the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next fifty years</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> struggled valiantly against the dictates of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desert</ENAMEX>, trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their
        circumstances and spread the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mormon</ENAMEX> faith. Additional pressures from
        arriving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">miners</ENAMEX> pushed the missionaries‚Äô plight beyond recovery. Their
        supplies scarce, their harvest meager, and their spirit broken, they
        abandoned the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1858</TIMEX>.
        Despite the fact that the local land was rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, by
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1865</TIMEX> most of the mining traffic through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> was of prospectors
        headed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Nevada</ENAMEX> in search of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. One
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opportunist</ENAMEX> who stayed was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Octavius Decatur Gass</ENAMEX>. Bestowed with plenty
        of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gass</ENAMEX> redirected his life by picking up where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mormons</ENAMEX> left
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">off‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇat least when it came to ranching and farming. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gass</ENAMEX> took over the
        abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mormon fort</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">640 acres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">260 hectares</NUMEX>) surrounding it,
        dubbing it the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ranch</ENAMEX>. He expanded the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> and irrigated the
        land so that it would support <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> had
        other results as well: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gass</ENAMEX> was named a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> of the peace and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">territorial legislator</ENAMEX>.
        Despite his ambition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gass‚</ENAMEX>Äô success was short-lived. In the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1870s</TIMEX>, he defaulted on a loan from rancher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archibald Stewart</ENAMEX>, so
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ranch</ENAMEX> for his own. True to wild-West
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stereotypes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> was slain by a neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>, leaving his
        strong-willed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen</ENAMEX>, to assume the duties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX>. Through
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1905</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Stewart</ENAMEX> expanded the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2000 acres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">810 hectares</NUMEX>),
        making quite a bit of money in the process.
        What happened next would mark the end of the successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vegas Ranch</ENAMEX> and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across
        almost all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western America</ENAMEX> to this day. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> was coming, and
        when it arrived, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> would never be the same again.
        Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tracks and Tracts</ENAMEX>
        At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the 19th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX>
        City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American West</ENAMEX>.
        Though the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> remained unlinked by rail, this was about to
        change quickly. When it did, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas Valley</ENAMEX> (which at the time
        had a non-native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 30</NUMEX>) would change as well.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Railroad</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, eager to secure a right-of-way for
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Angeles‚ÄìSalt Lake</ENAMEX> connection. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> would serve as a
        major stopover for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> rest and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> repair. For all this, the
        railroad needed land. As mapped, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> traveled directly through
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Stewart‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ranch</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> sold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.5 percent</NUMEX> of her ranch
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX>. The remainder she returned to the native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paiutes</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1905</TIMEX>, the route between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX>
        City was completed, and train <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> bore right down the center of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas Valley</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 May 1905</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> held a land sale‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa
        momentous step in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> history. Standing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">depot</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fremont</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> auctioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> lots they had
        subdivided from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> square blocks of desert scrub. Land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speculators</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad
        boomtown, and within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an afternoon</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80 percent</NUMEX> of the lots
        were sold.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> was no longer a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneer</ENAMEX> settlement. With
        rail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> in place and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">forty</ENAMEX> blocks of private property, it was
        ready to become a real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Businesses</ENAMEX> sprang up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>, and wooden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were erected to replace the tent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in which many of the early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settlers</ENAMEX> had lived. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One year</TIMEX> after the auction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> had ballooned to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, a portent of things to come for
        the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dam Good Luck</ENAMEX>
        From the beginning, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> was built to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> needed a way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> was the place. Growth
        continued for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> had telephones,
        round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmany of whom
        worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroad</ENAMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>. But such heady progress would soon
        come to a halt.
        The growing competition in rail transport resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> buying the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Angeles‚ÄìSalt Lake</ENAMEX> line. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Pacific</ENAMEX> then
        consolidated its operations, eliminating the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.
        Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> had been made a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevada‚</ENAMEX>Äôs new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clark</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> also outlawed gambling.
        These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> to the
        status of a small desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> that could no longer support its
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. But the southwest‚Äôs growing need for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, combined
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Vegas‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fortuitous proximity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado River</ENAMEX>, would give
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> chance to achieve prosperity.
        Construction on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hoover Dam</ENAMEX> (originally <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulder Dam</ENAMEX>,
        subsequently renamed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> who authorized the project)
        began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">canyon 45 miles</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 km</NUMEX>) southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>.
        Providing an influx of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$165 million</NUMEX> to the southwestern economy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dam</ENAMEX> played a major role in preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> from drying up, both
        financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also
        created <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Mead</ENAMEX>, the massive reservoir that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> provides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to
        all of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX>.
        More Government Help
        The construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hoover Dam</ENAMEX> did not single-handedly save
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, however. The state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> helped as well, by legalizing
        gambling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX> and thus solidifying the future of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, though
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> could never have known this at the time.
        The hordes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who attended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover Dam‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>
        dedication set the city‚Äôs now-formidable public relations machine into
        action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest
        citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn‚Äôt take long for the
        city to establish itself as a wild-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with an ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù
        attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal
        here, available <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any hour</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day</TIMEX> (or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>). Thus originated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX>
        Vegas‚Äôs reputation as an adult theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>.
        Additional catalysts for the valley‚Äôs growth came from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School</ENAMEX> (which became
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nellis Air Force Base</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nevada Test Site</ENAMEX>) in the north, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnesium</ENAMEX> in the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henderson</ENAMEX>, arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1940s</TIMEX>
        as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America‚Äôs</ENAMEX> war effort. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> had grown
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 20,000</NUMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">airmen</ENAMEX> moving in at a rapid pace.
        But this was not yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> of folklore.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobsters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rat Packers</ENAMEX>
        While many gambling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> opened Downtown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1940s</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> were built on the stretch of old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
        Highway that ultimately became the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Rancho Vegas</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>)
        was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, followed by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontier</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>). During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
        period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East Coast Syndicate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin ‚ÄúBugsy‚Äù Siegel</ENAMEX> earned a
        foothold as a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX>.
        By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX> had become one of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Vegas‚</ENAMEX>Äôs original
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visionaries</ENAMEX>, planning an opulent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> on the southern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX>
        Highway. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flamingo</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1946</TIMEX>, it did so with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> flair and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> flash. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bosses</ENAMEX> who
        financed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> were displeased with its performance; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siegel</ENAMEX> was
        murdered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1947</TIMEX>.
        Despite its initial failings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel‚Äôs Flamingo</ENAMEX> survived
        him, as did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob infiltration</ENAMEX> of casinos. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flamingo</ENAMEX> would
        launch over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX> of strong mob presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>. Freely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flowing ‚Äúcomps‚Äù</ENAMEX> (complimentary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, drink, and entertainment) were the
        order of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob bosses</ENAMEX> content to provide an environment of
        pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in.
        While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> was running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> were
        busily selling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> as a glamorous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> in the desert. From
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1940s</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1960s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> nurtured a growing sense that
        it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúEntertainment Capital of the World</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Emerging</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>, no
        longer content with playing small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX>, came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> with
        dreams of making it big. Many of them did. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sinatra</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne Newton</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Prima</ENAMEX> each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found
        themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were
        written. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rat Pack‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇoriginally <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Sinatra</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Martin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammy</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis Jr.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lawford</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey Bishop</ENAMEX>, all in town to film <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">11‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇlanded</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sands</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1960</TIMEX> for a legendary stay. Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> came as well, simply because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> was the place to
        be.
        As a result, more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> emerged along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thunderbird</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert Inn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sahara, Sands</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera hotels</ENAMEX> were erected
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX>, luring a curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX> drawn by tales of
        all-night partying, exclusive entertainment, and cheap accommodations.
        There was no longer any question: when you wanted some unbridled adult
        fun, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> was the place to be.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Legitimacy</ENAMEX>
        Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in
        its bid to control <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Las Vegas‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcorporate cash. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> had
        developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were
        made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, due primarily to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob infiltration</ENAMEX> and its inherent
        ties to illegal activities.
        That would change dramatically with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX> arrival of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">billionaire Howard Hughes</ENAMEX>. A legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> was
        nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>
        ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> immediately cloistered
        himself in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Desert Inn‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">penthouse</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several weeks later</TIMEX> he was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asked‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthen ordered‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇto</ENAMEX> vacate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to make room for high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rollers</ENAMEX>, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Thus began Hughes‚Äô legendary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300-million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Las</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> buying spree. When it was over, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> owned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX>, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">airport</ENAMEX>, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>, along with numerous plots of land stretching
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strip</ENAMEX> to the mountains.
        Hughes‚Äô actions would have beneficial repercussions, both
        immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> acquired
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes‚</ENAMEX>Äô investments, established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotels</ENAMEX>
        bought into the gaming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX>, and their influence helped draw a line
        in the desert sand between legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mob casinos</ENAMEX>, where
        illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the
        formation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevada Gaming Control Board</ENAMEX>, would signal the
        beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vision</ENAMEX>
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> moved in and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> was slowly pushed out,
        a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its
        increased legalization across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. What was once a sure thing became
        much more competitive. Casino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> had to reassess the nature of
        their business.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to really do so was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Wynn</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> and owner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Nugget</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wynn</ENAMEX> began
        plans to reinvigorate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> with a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. He bought several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strip properties‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Silver Slipper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castaways</ENAMEX> among them‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand
        demolished them to make way for a new kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">resort‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇMirage‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX> which
        became an instant success.
        Wynn‚Äôs demolition of the existing properties started a
        trend that, more than any other, describes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> at the end of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th century</TIMEX>: removal of old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> in exchange for the potential
        of new ones. This trend has led to many more demolitions, including the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunes</ENAMEX> (replaced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellagio</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aladdin</ENAMEX> (the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aladdin</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sands</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>.
        Wynn‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casinos</ENAMEX> have also set new standards. They can no
        longer be just a box filled with gaming tables, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and a
        showroom. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excalibur</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
        all followed <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mirage‚Äôs</ENAMEX> lead during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, offering themed
        environments and attractions for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
        As evidence of the ‚Äúever-faster‚Äù nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, by the
        middle of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> the new approach showed signs of backlash, with
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> criticizing the mediocrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> experience.
        The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>: the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. New <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> offer attractions and amenities
        modeled after those available in top resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> worldwide, including
        luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spas</ENAMEX>, signature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>.
        Additionally, a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">resorts‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsuch</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South-Seas</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">themed Mandalay Bay</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirage</ENAMEX>, and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Four Seasons‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare</ENAMEX> now
        catering exclusively to the luxury travel market. The cr√®me <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la</ENAMEX> cr√®me
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> deluxe is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Wynn‚Äôs Bellagio</ENAMEX>. The world‚Äôs most
        expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.6 billion</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellagio‚</ENAMEX>Äôs amenities include
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-star dining, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel</ENAMEX>-caliber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and a world-class collection
        of artistic masterworks. Perhaps more important, such high-end
        accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the
        mythology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Rat Pack</ENAMEX> era.
        As it changed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mob</ENAMEX> gam bling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to corporate gaming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">venue</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> skyrocketed. Over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> additional
        hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> have been added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few short years</TIMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summerlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Las Vegas</ENAMEX>. Recent business projections for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>
        predict challenges; tourism revenues must increase substantially to
        sustain what is already built, while actual figures show visitation as
        steady or declining. The growth that has characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century</TIMEX> may be facing a roadblock.
        Still, the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> is sure to be determined as
        much by the pioneering spirit that built the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> as by anything else.
        With its new look and new aim, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prospects</ENAMEX> are good despite the
        warnings. Inevitably, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will get burned in the process, but
        others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes.
        And that, more than anything, is the one constant that characterizes
        the past, present, and future of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>.
