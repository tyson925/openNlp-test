        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica</ENAMEX> will be near the top of the list for
        anyone planning an idyllic holiday getaway. With warm sunshine,
        beautiful beaches, lush tropical scenery, and fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, it is
        guaranteed to provide a little rest and relaxation. However, with a
        vibrant grassroots culture and the growing confidence of an independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>, it defies the advertising stereotype of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äúdeserted</ENAMEX> island. ‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> is not just a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">destination‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit</ENAMEX> is an experience.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, just south of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">233 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">145 miles</NUMEX>) in length and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">83 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">52 miles</NUMEX>)
        across at its widest point. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is aligned almost east-to-west
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> so that sunrise wakes the eastern tip, proceeds to caress
        the length of the island, and kisses the western tip ‚<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Äúgood night</TIMEX>. ‚Äù
        Geographically it is extremely diverse, with a central backbone of high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountains</ENAMEX> and hills blanketed with tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>-forest. These are
        surrounded by areas of limestone formations, scrub and grassland, coral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cliffs</ENAMEX>, and fine sand beaches. Fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from tropical storms feeds
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> rivers and some of the most celebrated waterfalls and cascades on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">earth</ENAMEX>.
        On land, there is a wealth of animal and bird life. Rare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterflies</ENAMEX> and delicate hummingbirds take to the air, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crocodiles</ENAMEX> and manatees still live in and around vast tracts of
        mangrove swamp in the south. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is surrounded by coral reefs
        and reef walls, which provide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of species of sea
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> and recreation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> and snorkelers.
        Temperatures here vary <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a few degrees</NUMEX> from about 27¬∞C
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">80¬∞F</NUMEX>), although the heat is tempered by the nearly continuous trade
        winds that blow across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. In the mountains and hills of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX>, the temperature drops with altitude and with the clouds that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wrap</ENAMEX> around the highest peaks.
        Much of the land is extremely fertile and produces a range
        of tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crops</ENAMEX>, providing ample <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and such lucrative cash <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four hundred</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> brought <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonists</ENAMEX> to rule the land and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> slaves to work it. The bitter taste of slavery is always in the
        background.
        Today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>, and a smattering of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese Jews</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Welsh</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scots</ENAMEX>. They have been melded together, giving rise
        to a fascinating national <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúidentity</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">independence in 1962</TIMEX>, the
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX> has worked to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> based on confidence from
        within, working on a principle of pride in oneself and in one‚Äôs roots.
        This is so important for the future of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that the national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motto</ENAMEX> is ‚ÄúOut of many‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        It says much about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that
        they have slightly changed the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> and his trip to the
        island in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1493</TIMEX>. He is not held in the same high esteem here as he is in
        other islands. As someone has said, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> only thought that he had
        discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX>. In actuality, it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> who
        discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">him‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇColumbus</ENAMEX> was really lost, thinking that he had found
        another route to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
        Vestiges of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> colonial legacy can still be found,
        not least in the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica‚Äôs</ENAMEX> official language: the
        popularity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> is another example. The thirteen regional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parishes</ENAMEX> and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> were originally named after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        settlements. You can find <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manchester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sheffield</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX>, to name but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>. However, these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> influences have,
        even from the earliest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of colonial rule, always been tempered and
        molded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaican</ENAMEX> style. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> has always had a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúunofficial‚Äù language</ENAMEX> developed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> of slavery. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">creole</ENAMEX>, a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> words and phrases,
        is still evolving and often indecipherable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outsider</ENAMEX>. Next to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> names derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll also find names such as ‚ÄúWait
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Awhile‚Äù and ‚ÄúFruitful Vale</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù</ENAMEX> derived from the function and activity of
        the everyday lives of ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaicans</ENAMEX>. And as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX> is
        concerned, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> have turned the tables on their colonial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mentors</ENAMEX> and now produce some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in the world, easily
        capable of soundly outplaying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brits</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> the influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has been
        much stronger than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaicans</ENAMEX> head to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">States</ENAMEX>
        for further education, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> economic influence on areas
        such as business investment and planning is growing. It‚Äôs no surprise
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> dollar is accepted as readily as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaican</ENAMEX> dollar to pay
        for goods.
        But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica</ENAMEX> is not simply turning blindly into a small
        version of its bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>. It still revels in its own identity,
        which is now internationally recognized through such influential
        cultural products as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rastafarian</ENAMEX> religion and reggae music. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rastafarianism</ENAMEX> (with their characteristic mane of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúdreadlocks‚Äù</ENAMEX>) originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX> and are still
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predominantly</ENAMEX> found here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Jamaican music‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇska</ENAMEX> and, especially,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">reggae‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhas</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> been exported and enjoyed around the
        world. The strong beat and earthy lyrics seem to symbolize and
        celebrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of this young and lively <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        Jamaicans are sociable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, living their lives out in
        the open and knowing everything about their neighbor‚Äôs business.
        There‚Äôs nothing they like better than having a good chat about the
        latest bit of gossip: who is doing what, where, and why. They are very
        direct in their dealings with each other, as you might discover if you
        come across a friendly conversation among a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. The loud,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">raucous Jamaican English</ENAMEX> dialect and the waving hands reflect the joy
        with which social relations are conducted here. They are equally direct
        in their dealings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, too, so don‚Äôt expect a shy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaican</ENAMEX>
        smile as you walk by. Instead, be prepared for a barrage of questions
        about your life, offers to supply anything you need, a host of jokes at
        your expense, and some serious flirting if you‚Äôre single. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaicans</ENAMEX> can
        definitely be ‚Äúin your face. ‚Äù But don‚Äôt feel intimidated, as their
        attitude is not personal. Having some lines ready to throw back at them
        induces guffaws of laughter and an appreciative slap on the back.
        The recreational pleasures that ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> enjoy
        have become synonymous with the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica</ENAMEX>: dancing to the heavily
        rhythmic musical beat; taking a little marijuana (or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúganja,‚Äù as it‚Äôs
        known here), which many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaicans</ENAMEX> view as a kind of medicinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">herb</ENAMEX>; or
        simply sitting back and chatting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> on a bench or street
        corner, where the situation is described as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúIrie‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe equivalent of
        ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs just fine! ‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaicans</ENAMEX> appear to worry little about the future;
        sometimes it seems that they worry little even about what happens in
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next few minutes</TIMEX>. The popular phrase ‚ÄúSoon come‚Äù indicates an
        apparent lack of concern about time and an unhurried attitude to daily
        tasks. Occasional hurricanes can spoil the idyllic climate and
        contribute to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">‚Äúlaid back‚Äù</ENAMEX> attitude: Jamaicans are aware that
        circumstances can suddenly alter dramatically and yet life will always
        carry on. To have to wait a while for something is not the worst
        problem in the world.
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">independence in 1962</TIMEX>, tourism has been Jamaica‚Äôs
        primary industry and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has become renowned as one of the prime
        destinations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. The best beaches have become home to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finest hotels</ENAMEX>, which supply almost everything needed for the perfect
        vacation. All-inclusive packages and large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort hotels</ENAMEX> offer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, sporting activities, entertainment, wide-screen sports
        channels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, shopping, and a guaranteed suntan. There is
        frequently a temptation never to tear oneself away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. Yet
        to do this is to miss the very essence of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is all about.
        Step out of the hotel and your senses will be bombarded by a range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sights</ENAMEX>, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures that let you know that you
        could only be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX>.
        Such sights include the colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äútams‚Äù</ENAMEX> (knitted hats worn
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jamaican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> to cover their mane of dreadlocks) and the red ackee
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX> that ripens at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the year</TIMEX>. Sample the taste of
        ackee cooked with saltfish, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica‚Äôs</ENAMEX> national dish, and the smell of
        hot jerk <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> cooked in a pit barbecue. Hear the songs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Marley</ENAMEX>
        booming from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> cranked-up car stereos or the chorus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">frogs</ENAMEX>
        that begin to call as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> descends. Feel the texture of a hand
        offered in greeting and try to fathom the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúJamaican handshake,‚Äù a</ENAMEX>
        ritual whose rules seem to be more complex than those of the game of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX>.
        Of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> has its palm-lined beaches and almost
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">endless</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rum drinks</ENAMEX>, and you can enjoy a wonderful resort-based break.
        But once you begin to look underneath this initial veneer of a
        ‚Äúdo-nothing-in-the-tropics‚Äù <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holiday</TIMEX>, it‚Äôs like peeling the layers of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">onion</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs an abundance of nature, history, art, and modern culture
        to be explored and enjoyed. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> is an island with a strong
        personality that doesn‚Äôt simply wait in the wings. It comes out to meet
        you.
