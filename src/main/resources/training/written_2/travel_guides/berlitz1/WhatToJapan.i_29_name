        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
        Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has embraced the consumer society to such an
        extent that shopping can be a full-time pursuit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        themselves (in the big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> at least) can be seen more often than not
        with some kind of shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bag‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthey</ENAMEX> make very large, sturdy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ones‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇjust</ENAMEX> on the off chance that they might want to buy something.
        You cannot get to know this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> properly, even if you don‚Äôt want to
        buy anything, without exploring the rich and varied range of
        traditional arts and crafts, the famous cornucopia of electronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gadgets</ENAMEX> and precision instruments, or the impressively awful selection
        of kitsch souvenirs in the major tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is notoriously expensive, so don‚Äôt expect fabulous
        bargains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has succeeded economically by fixing the best
        price it can get for everything, but the domestic market pays high
        prices because of a stiff sales tax and surprisingly convoluted and
        inefficient distribution systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> visiting other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are still shocked to find <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> consumer goods available
        for far less than they have to pay at home.
        Start by looking at the range of goods in the department
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the underground shopping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX> before going off to find better prices at discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
        Department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> generally offer superb selections of everything‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest prices.
        You might be tempted to do your shopping at the end of your
        trip so you won‚Äôt have to drag all that electronic equipment,
        lacquerware, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, or whatever around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with you.
        Instead, consider buying everything you want as you go along, using
        Japan‚Äôs remarkably efficient and inexpensive takkyubin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> delivery
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> (available at the ubiquitous convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>) to forward
        your larger purchases to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, where they will be waiting for you
        on your return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> or elsewhere. Given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs relatively low
        crime rates, you can be sure you‚Äôll be reunited with your precious
        souvenirs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hi-Tech Products</ENAMEX>
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, the place to go for every electronic and computer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">item imaginable‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand plenty</ENAMEX> that you didn‚Äôt even know existed‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis
        Akihabara, an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> devoted to specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> selling
        mountains of electronic equipment often at very low prices. The larger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> usually have a tax-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> offering a narrower range of
        products designed for use abroad. English-speaking sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> are
        often on hand, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> expect the same discount prices that are
        offered on the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>, despite the tax-free incentive.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> draw for visiting gadget <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freaks</ENAMEX> is being able to buy the
        very latest equipment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months ahead</TIMEX> of its sales launch abroad.
        However, cameras and electronic goods are rarely available at better
        prices than those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, still the world‚Äôs reigning discount
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. Those hunting for computer software and hardware should not
        expect to find anything other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese-language</ENAMEX> products for
        sale.
        Osaka‚Äôs equivalent hi-tech shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is
        Nipponbashi, a very poor relation to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akihabara</ENAMEX> with neither the range
        nor the prices available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
        Note that local electric current is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 volts/50</NUMEX> (or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60</NUMEX>)
        cycles, which is slightly different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and completely
        different from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Therefore, if you don‚Äôt want to bother with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">converters</ENAMEX>, stick to the top-floor tax-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> specializing in
        export goods designed for use around the world. Also note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        VCRs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVs</ENAMEX> are designed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSC</ENAMEX>, the same broadcast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> used in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America</ENAMEX>. If you plan to buy anything for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> or
        elsewhere (where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PAL</ENAMEX> is the main broadcast standard), make sure you
        purchase a multisystem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>; only these are compatible with the various
        broadcast standards in use around the globe.
        Cameras. As an exception to the general rule of not making
        big purchases until near the end of your visit, it makes sense to buy
        camera equipment as soon as possible so you can try it out during the
        trip. If a fault occurs, you can arrange to have it repaired or
        exchanged before you leave. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are good about exchanging
        faulty goods. Note, though, that warranties are often valid in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
        only, so check with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> for details of upgrading to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX> coverage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinjuku</ENAMEX> has Tokyo‚Äôs largest discount camera
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, although these rarely offer better prices than those available
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous mail-order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traditional Goods</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimono</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> silk kimono are magnificent but
        staggeringly expensive. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> save up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to buy
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and then often spend an equal amount of time in debt after making
        the investment. If you‚Äôre not among the world‚Äôs wealthiest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>,
        the good news is that new and nearly new kimono are usually sold for a
        tiny fraction of their new prices at the big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> markets held at
        temples, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, and other large communal sites. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are
        highly superstitious about acquiring second-hand goods, especially
        clothing. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, try <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> market at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harajuku</ENAMEX>, and check the
        English-language press for details of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> and temple markets.
        Kyoto‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> markets are held at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Toji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st</TIMEX> of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX>) and at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kitano Temmangu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25th</NUMEX>), but there are many
        others.
        Another alternative is the more modest but still elegant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yukata</ENAMEX> (light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton kimono</ENAMEX>), traditionally in indigo-blue and white
        and much, much cheaper than anything made of silk. Also look out for
        the silk obi sashes used to tie kimono. Some are magnificently
        decorative in their own right; if you don‚Äôt want to wear one, consider
        an obi as an original and unusual wall-hanging in a Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiques</ENAMEX>. For antique furniture and miscellaneous items,
        Kyoto‚Äôs famous geisha district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gion</ENAMEX> has one of the finest selections
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. Even if you‚Äôre just browsing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nawate-dori</ENAMEX>,
        Furomonzen-dori, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shinmonzen</ENAMEX>-dori offer a superb selection of
        antique furniture, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, masks, lacquerware, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        objects.
        Artwork. Attractively colorful ukiyo<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-e</ENAMEX> woodblock prints and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">scroll</ENAMEX> paintings can be found in antique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, second-hand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bookstores</ENAMEX>, and even temple markets. Prices vary enormously, so
        shopping around usually pays off handsomely.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pottery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>. These are very much a living
        tradition that has maintained its high standards. Most regions have
        their own distinct styles, varying from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ornate and highly
        glazed kiyomizu-yaki to the beautiful natural earthenware of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bizen</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okayama</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shigaraki</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mashiko</ENAMEX>, to the north
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, is well worth a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">day‚Äôs train</ENAMEX> excursion if you are interested
        in seeing how some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most celebrated pottery is made; the
        prices here are slightly better than back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. You can also stay
        for lessons.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lacquerware</ENAMEX>. You are least likely to go wrong in terms of
        uniformly high quality if you‚Äôre in the market for lacquerware. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Trays,</ENAMEX>
        plates, bowls, and jewelry boxes are superbly finished‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand not so
        heavy as to create problems of excess baggage.
        Paper goods. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Fans</ENAMEX>, dolls, and hand-made stationery are
        usually reasonably priced but produced with the same meticulous care as
        are objects made from more precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX>.
        Books. Tokyo‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kanda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is devoted almost entirely to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">second-hand</ENAMEX> books. The biggest neighborhood of its kind in the world,
        it sells books in most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> languages as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll
        also find excellent old maps and prints here, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> know
        the going price for everything; real bargains are few and far
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX>.
        Entertainment
        For information on all current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> theater programs and
        show times, consult free <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tokyo Weekender</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo Classified</ENAMEX>, which are available in your hotel and in the foreign
        book sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinokuniya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maruzen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bookstores</ENAMEX>.
        As one of the most vivid and important expressions of
        Japan‚Äôs traditional cultural heritage, theater is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX> in
        itself. Traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> drama, because of its stylization,
        extravagant gesture, and solemn or even bizarre intonation, might be
        difficult for Westerners. However, perseverance will be well rewarded
        once you get used to the conventions. The impact of the impassioned
        performances, aided by stunning costumes and elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">make-up</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masks</ENAMEX>, can be utterly seductive; many a skeptic has emerged an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX>.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> theater aims less at developing a coherent plot, in the
        Western manner, than at creating a particular tone, atmosphere, and
        emotional extremes.
        Noh
        This is the oldest theatrical form, strictly speaking, and
        also the most austere and demanding. Derived originally from ritual
        dances of the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> noh
        became a fully developed masked drama of chanting, dancing, and highly
        stylized acting. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> and just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> enact
        stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, historic battles, ghosts, unhappy love, and
        grief-stricken <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">insanity</ENAMEX>. The more somber themes alternate with kyogen
        farces about the life of the common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, which often feature a
        satirical element.
        The commentary is chanted by a chorus of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six to eight</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">narrators</ENAMEX> (reminiscent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chorus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> tragedy) who sit at the
        side of the stage, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> positioned at the back of the stage
        provide stark accompaniment with flute and drums. Contrasting with the
        resplendent costumes, the set has an austere simplicity: a backdrop
        (usually a permanent wall) of a large pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and some bamboo, with
        no curtain. The stage is framed by a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tiled</ENAMEX> roof
        making a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhouse‚Äù</ENAMEX> inside the theater.
        Male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX>, in masks, play all the roles. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Characters</ENAMEX> often
        take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX> to enter and exit the stage, moving painfully
        slowly in one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest examples of form over function. For
        aficionados, a noh performance is an eclectic nirvana. For many others,
        it is powerfully soporific. Look around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> and you‚Äôll see
        plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> nodding off unselfconsciously.
        Performances <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last several hours</TIMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as five</NUMEX> plays
        in a program. You can probably manage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least a couple</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>
        often provide a good buffet between plays. See the best ones at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Noh Theater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanze Kaikan</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shibuya</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚Äôs National Noh</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater</ENAMEX>. Other fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troupes</ENAMEX> perform in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanazawa</ENAMEX>.
        Kabuki
        Ever since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shoguns restricted performances to
        the samurai <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>, noh drama has had a rather elitist appeal. Kabuki,
        on the other hand, has proved much more popular. Equally stylized in
        its way, kabuki is filled with fantastic color, movement, action,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">drama</ENAMEX>, and comedy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> are folk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>, and the greatest of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">them‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdescendants</ENAMEX> of centuries-old dynasties of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">actors‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare</ENAMEX> declared
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúLiving National Treasures</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù Audience</ENAMEX> participation is at fever pitch,
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> yelling as their personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> enter: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúWe‚Äôve</ENAMEX> waited for
        you! ‚Äù or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúYou‚Äôre the greatest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>! ‚Äù
        Nothing is spared in the way of costumes and d√©cor; there
        is no such thing as ‚Äúover the top. ‚Äù Ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>,
        revolving stages and trapdoors have been employed for supernatural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> to rise to the stage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular</ENAMEX>, but art of the highest order,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kabuki</ENAMEX> tells stories of horror, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and thunder, and passionate love.
        Connoisseurs wait for the set pieces: the colorful parade of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtesan</ENAMEX>, a poignant seppuku suicide, the exciting fight scenes,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">and‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsummit</ENAMEX> of the art of kabuki‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe end of a love affair that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroine</ENAMEX> must break off, perhaps to save her lover‚Äôs honor, but never
        because she no longer loves him.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äú She‚</ENAMEX>Äù is in fact likely to be a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>. In the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early days</TIMEX> of kabuki, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 17th century</TIMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acclaimed Kyoto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> started to present increasingly erotic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lascivious</ENAMEX> performances. With the audience‚Äôs passionate loyalties to
        various star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> often leading to fights, the prudish Tokugawa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shogunate</ENAMEX> decided to ban female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX>, fearing a breakdown in
        all-important social order. However, they then found that the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>
        who took over the female roles were also attracting ardent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devotees</ENAMEX>
        among military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and even priests‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhomosexuality at that time
        was not yet frowned upon. So they were in turn replaced by older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.
        After years of study, these onnagata make an astoundingly subtle and
        delicate art of capturing the gestures and movements of both young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX> and old crones.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tokyo‚Äôs Kabuki-za Theater</ENAMEX>, you can rent headphones for
        the performance, providing simultaneous English-language translation of
        the important dialogue along with explanations of the action and
        conventions. Shows last up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX>, but you can buy cheaper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">balcony</ENAMEX> tickets for just part of the program. Kyoto‚Äôs kabuki <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troupe</ENAMEX>
        performs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>.
        Bunraku
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Japan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> celebrated puppet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> can be seen at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bunraku Theater</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Osaka‚Äôs Nipponbashi district</ENAMEX>, although
        performances are also put on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks each year</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Theater</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt be misled: bunraku is theater for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> rather
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, using the same dramatic themes, stories, and conventions
        as in noh and kabuki but achieving a unique impact with the almost
        life-sized, colorfully costumed puppets. The puppeteers, dressed all in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX>, are initially distractingly visible on stage, manipulating and
        walking around with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppets‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyet completely ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù</ENAMEX> from
        your perception as the magic of the drama sweeps you away. A detailed
        English explanation of the plot is always provided, and wireless
        recorded commentary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> are sometimes available.
        Bunraku‚Äôs heyday was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the 18th century</TIMEX>,
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playwright</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monzaemon Chikamatsu</ENAMEX> wrote works specifically for the
        puppets that are regarded as among the greatest achievements of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> literature. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heroism</ENAMEX> in battle and the noble values of the
        samurai tradition are the principal themes. It comes as quite a shock
        to watch a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> performing his final gesture of ritual suicide and
        realize that it‚Äôs only a puppet. The emotional effect is undiminished,
        and the gory effects are usually horribly creative.
        Film
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> industry is in lingering recession,
        with growing numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> preferring to watch videos at home.
        Don‚Äôt be surprised to see the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blockbusters</ENAMEX> on release.
        These attract bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> than do current local offerings, which
        seem tawdry and unoriginal after the towering creativity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX> like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurosawa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oshima</ENAMEX>. Despite occasional surprise international
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">successes</ENAMEX> (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unagi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shall We Dance</ENAMEX>? ), <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> will
        probably continue to be dominated by recycled ultraviolent gangster
        tales until it undergoes long-overdue industry reforms.
        Nightlife
        If you‚Äôd like to see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> handle Western-style
        popular music and dancing, you‚Äôll find good quality jazz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>,
        conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> (with, naturally, fantastic electronic equipment),
        and even country-and-western saloons, all in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cosmopolitan
        restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akasaka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roppongi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teenagers</ENAMEX> might like to
        join the open-air disco <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hordes</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harajuku</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yoyogi Park</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Festivals and Folklore</ENAMEX>
        Despite increasing urbanization and social change, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> retains its small, closely knit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> strongly dependent
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shinto gods</ENAMEX> to ensure good harvests for survival. Forget the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">karaoke</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet trains</ENAMEX>, and all those mobile phones for a moment.
        With such a highly developed sense of ritual and tradition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matsuri</ENAMEX> (festivals) are much more than just fun for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>: for
        many they remain integral to life itself. There is at least one
        festival happening somewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day of the year</TIMEX>.
        Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> has its own festivals or variations on the
        large national ones. Most honor either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shinto</ENAMEX> deities and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> or
        major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples. Buddhist festivals are usually fairly
        restrained affairs, often involving an important image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>
        that might be available for public viewing only on this occasion.
        The real drama is at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinto</ENAMEX> festivals. Some are austere
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> ceremonies involving traditional music, chanting, dance,
        and often fire. At the opposite extreme are massive, almost riotous
        processions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of bellowing, sweat-drenched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> fighting to
        carry a huge portable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to a symbolic
        destination. Such is their exuberance and rapture that real outbreaks
        of violence can occur. These events have to be seen to be believed:
        they demonstrate the perfect flip-side of the supposedly reserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> character.
        Festivals are where superficially modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> gives way to
        the old, where ancient traditions are upheld, especially in remote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>. But there is usually a strong commercial aspect to the
        celebrations. Some rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> devise small but colorful
        festivals to galvanize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community spirit</ENAMEX> and the local economy by
        attracting badly needed domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>.
        Many festivals, though, are so spectacular that it is worth
        planning your visit specifically so you can attend. Definitely check
        with your nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan National Tourist Office</ENAMEX> for information when
        planning your trip. Note that since many festivals follow the lunar
        calendar, the actual dates vary from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX>. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">festivals</ENAMEX> and ceremonies taking place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX>, this entire book
        wouldn‚Äôt provide enough space to describe them all. Instead, we offer a
        sampling of large and small festivals. But when planning a visit, some
        supplementary research will probably uncover unexpected nuggets.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Year‚Äôs Day</ENAMEX> is the big <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">festival</ENAMEX>,
        closest in spirit to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> in the West, the time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> pay visits to each other and to the local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>. New Year‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> is a quieter, more solemn affair than in the West, when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> flock to famous shrines to pray for good fortune for the
        coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> decorate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and even <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> with
        a bouquet of pine and bamboo, symbols of evergreen stability and
        upright behavior. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 January</TIMEX>, the inner grounds of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Palace</ENAMEX> are opened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> coming to pay
        their respects to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> and enjoy a closer peek at his palace
        than is possible during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the year</TIMEX>.
        Closet pyromaniacs shouldn‚Äôt miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nara‚Äôs Wakakusayama Turf</ENAMEX>
        Burning ceremony on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 January</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> dressed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> monks
        burn the entire hillside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Wakakusa</ENAMEX> after sunset, creating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
        the year‚Äôs most photographed spectacles, visible from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> around. The
        15th is also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coming-of-Age Day</ENAMEX> nationwide, a milestone event for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year-olds</TIMEX> attaining the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">majority</ENAMEX>. They attend special
        ceremonies at local community <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> dress in unusually
        opulent fur-trimmed kimono worn only on this special day.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. The important setsubun <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">festival</ENAMEX> marks the end of
        winter around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3‚Äì4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> represented by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> wearing fearsome masks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">onlookers</ENAMEX> throw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> to drive them
        away while shouting, ‚ÄúDemons out, good fortune in! ‚Äù The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3rd</NUMEX> and 4th
        are also one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> occasions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> when the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,000 lanterns</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kasuga Grand Shrine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nara</ENAMEX> are lit. (The event is repeated on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14‚Äì15</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. )
        Up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido, Sapporo</ENAMEX> holds its internationally popular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow Festival</ENAMEX> (during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first or second week of February</TIMEX>). The
        highlight is an ice sculpture competition at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Odori Park</ENAMEX>, with huge
        superbly detailed models of castles, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, and giant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> both
        traditional and modern. Throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> living in snowy
        areas look forward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Kamakura Festival</ENAMEX>, when they build
        igloo-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 March</TIMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hina Doll Festival</ENAMEX>, a special
        event for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exquisitely</ENAMEX> detailed dolls in ancient costumes
        representing the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> and other aristocrats are displayed
        for good luck. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> display <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of dolls brought by the
        faithful.
        Another annual highlight is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O-Mizu</ENAMEX>-tori
        Festival at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara‚Äôs Nigatsudo Temple</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Todaiji‚</ENAMEX>Äôs subtemples.
        Although the central event is a solemn and highly symbolic
        water-drawing ceremony, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> turn out in force for the more
        public and spectacular fire ceremonies. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every night</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1st</TIMEX> to the
        14th, in a highly dramatic display clearly designed to entertain,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> brandishing long poles with a flaming cedar ball at each
        end run along the front of the verandah, deliberately showering the
        large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> below with burning embers. (believed to bring good luck for
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coming year</TIMEX>, having burned away the transgressions from the
        previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>). In long-exposure photographs of this display, the entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> appears to be on fire. There is nothing like this anywhere.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photographers</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miss</ENAMEX> this at your peril!
        Another visual treat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> is the annual fertility
        festival held at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagata Jinja</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gifu Prefecture</ENAMEX>, north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX>. This
        amazing shrine celebrates an object that transcends borders and
        cultural barriers: the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">penis</ENAMEX>. Phalluses huge and humble, wooden
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> are enshrined and worshipped here. And on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 March each year</TIMEX>,
        the mightiest specimen, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.5 ft</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monster</ENAMEX> made of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> cypress
        and weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 270 kg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">600 pounds</NUMEX>) is slowly carried through this
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, bulging out of its portable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>. See it and you still
        won‚Äôt believe it.
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 March</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Dragon</ENAMEX> dance is held at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        Senso-ji <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asakusa</ENAMEX>), accompanied by a ceremonial carriage
        bearing several geisha playing traditional musical instruments.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚Äôs</ENAMEX> birthday is celebrated with flower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">festivals</ENAMEX> held throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. The best place to view the spring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">azaleas</ENAMEX> is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Azalea Festival</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week of April</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nezu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansai</ENAMEX> region, peony <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers head</ENAMEX> for Hasedera
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nara</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> is also cherry blossom <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>, with
        blossom-viewing picnics (hanami) held in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and temples throughout
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry-blossom ‚Äúfront‚Äù</ENAMEX> makes its steady progress
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">northward</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th and 15th</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takayama</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gifu Prefecture</ENAMEX>
        holds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest processions of large, colorful
        floats.
        May. From the end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> and into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early May</TIMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Week</ENAMEX>,
        the unofficial name for the conjunction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">holidays</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green Day</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constitution Day</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children‚Äôs Day</ENAMEX>). Since this
        is the only time many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> are permitted to take a vacation, it is
        the worst time to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, since every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, inn, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, and even
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plane</ENAMEX> is booked up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> in advance. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boys‚Äô Day</ENAMEX> was officially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">renamed Children‚Äôs Day</ENAMEX> to include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>, the reality is taking some
        time to catch on. This festival features giant carp <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">streamers</ENAMEX> flying
        from poles throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. The carp‚Äôs ability to struggle upstream
        against a strong current is regarded as a fit model for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>.
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 May</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> celebrates its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hollyhock Festival</ENAMEX> (Aoi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsuri</ENAMEX>). This ancient ritual is meant to pave the way for a good
        harvest, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of hollyhock to stave off thunder and
        earthquakes. The hollyhock decorates a big red oxcart, accompanied from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Gosho Palace</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> dressed in splendid
        Heian-period costumes.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> onward, ukai celebrates the ancient use of
        cormorant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> to catch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">aiyu</ENAMEX>, a popular river <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. The animal rights
        movement has yet to penetrate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> in any significant way: the
        cormorants‚Äô throats are constricted so they can‚Äôt swallow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> they
        catch underwater, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> retrieve the catch when the hapless
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds resurface</ENAMEX>. The various events held around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> are usually
        highly ceremonial, with blazing torches illuminating the
        proceedings.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>. Kyoto‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gion Festival</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17‚Äì24</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>) is the most
        elaborate procession of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, with its grandiose floats and glowing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lanterns</ENAMEX>. Originally, the festival invoked the help of the gods against
        a plague in medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>; highly commercialized imitations of it are
        now celebrated all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Immediately after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gion</ENAMEX>, on the
        24th and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">25th</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> holds its flamboyant and mammoth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenjin Matsuri</ENAMEX>,
        starting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Temmangu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>. It has fireworks, flaming torches,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gaily decorated</ENAMEX> floats on the central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okawa River</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. At the height of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> swelter in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-bon, a colorful and joyous national <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> festival
        honoring the spirits of deceased ancestors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> travel around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to clean their family tombs and gravestones. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagasaki</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mid-August</ENAMEX>, glowing lanterns decorate the graveyards, while other
        lanterns are put out to sea on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model boats</ENAMEX> to take the departed souls
        back to their other world. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Golden Week in April‚ÄìMay</ENAMEX>, this is a
        great time to avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> unless you relish competing for every train
        seat and hotel bed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of others. So bad is the traffic that
        many of the country‚Äôs expressways come to a virtual standstill.
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th and 15th of the month</TIMEX> is the year‚Äôs second
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lighting</ENAMEX>-up of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of lanterns at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kasuga Grand Shrine</ENAMEX> in

        When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> decide to do something, they seem to take
        a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äútotal-immersion‚</NUMEX>Äù route, buying the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfits</ENAMEX> and equipment so
        that they look like seasoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> before they take a single

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis</ENAMEX>. With land prices notoriously high, urban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are
        crowded and expensive, so your best bet is at the seaside or hot-spring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>. If necessary, get your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> to help you make
        reservations.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Golf</ENAMEX>. Unsurprisingly, golfing is prohibitively expensive.
        You will have to share the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> golfer‚Äôs manic obsession to want to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shell</ENAMEX> out green fees of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">well over US$100</NUMEX> at top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> during peak
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX>. The best way to enjoy a round of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> is as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> or business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX>.
        Swimming. Beaches close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> are crowded
        (except after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> has officially
        ended). So you are better off going south to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX>, around Shimabara
        and the more secluded of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amakusa Islands</ENAMEX> (for snorkeling and
        scuba-diving, too) or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibusuki</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water</ENAMEX> sports
        enthusiasts go south to the beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okinawa</ENAMEX>, the liveliest being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon Beach</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nakadomari</ENAMEX>.
        Fishing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the joys of fishing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is taking the
        catch back to your Japanese-style <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">inn</ENAMEX> and having the cook grill it for
        you or turn it into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sushi</ENAMEX> or sashimi (depending on your degree of faith
        in the cleanliness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highly polluted rivers). Freshwater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">angling‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfor bass</ENAMEX>, carp, or trout‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis good anywhere in the lakes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streams</ENAMEX>, best of all up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido</ENAMEX>, where you stand a decent chance of
        hooking a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">salmon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> bream and sea <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass</ENAMEX> are the most frequent catch in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> waters. Ask about license restrictions at the local tourist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.
        Skiing. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> has a number of excellent skiing areas, which
        quickly get very crowded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>. Winter sports are one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        main draws for domestic tourism, with popular ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia</ENAMEX> (outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sapporo</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Niseko</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiroro</ENAMEX>. Others are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zao</ENAMEX> (in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tohoku</ENAMEX>) and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Joshin</ENAMEX>-etsu <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kogen National Park</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan Alps</ENAMEX>, where there are now splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> thanks to the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Olympic Games</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagano</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Baseball</ENAMEX>. The game is at least as popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> as it is
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>. It was introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, together with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railways</ENAMEX>, cameras, and whisky. Today <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> is big business, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cheerleaders</ENAMEX>, balloons, and variations on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Major League</ENAMEX> hype. The major
        professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are owned by the biggest publishing empires or
        department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store chains</ENAMEX>, each combining their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> name with the
        time-honored <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> nicknames, the most famous being the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yomiuri</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> have happily adopted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> jargon
        of ‚ÄúStrike one, ball <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚Äúhome</ENAMEX> run,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù and ‚Äúpinch</ENAMEX> hit. ‚Äù In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> you
        can see games at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Korakuen Stadium</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissei</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumo</ENAMEX>. Of the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> sports, sumo wrestling is
        the most popular. This ancient sport originated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 15 centuries</TIMEX>
        ago in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Shinto</ENAMEX> ceremonies. Today, sumo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">champions‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> still
        allowed to wear the samurai <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior‚</ENAMEX>Äôs gleaming top-knot hairdo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare
        national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> and are much in demand for TV commercials. At the
        national level, there are a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">575</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestlers</ENAMEX> classed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
        divisions according to their win-loss ratio in the annual tournaments.
        The highest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> is the makuuchi, of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">champions</ENAMEX> are known
        as yokozuna. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX> weigh anything from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">165 kg</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200 to 350</NUMEX>
        pounds), yet they have grace, dignity, and suppleness that belie their
        massive bulk.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">dohyo-iri</ENAMEX> (ring entry) ceremony opening the tournament
        is a fascinating spectacle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX> strut into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">richly embroidered silk ‚Äúaprons‚Äù</ENAMEX> covering the solid band protecting
        their midriffs. In the dohyo, a raised mound of hard clay <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 4.6 m</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ft) in diameter under a large suspended Shinto-roof-style
        canopy,toss salt across the dohyo to purify it of evil spirits, swagger
        around, and commence the all-important ‚Äúpsyching-out‚Äù of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>.
        Pointedly avoiding each other‚Äôs eyes, they raise a massive leg into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX> (to a height that would do a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> proud), slam it
        down with a mighty thud, and lower themselves into the characteristic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">squat</ENAMEX>. This goes on for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">minutes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇall</ENAMEX> part of the great
        ritual buildup of tension before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestlers</ENAMEX> clash. Note that
        indulging in these highly stylized opening theatrics is a privilege of
        top-ranked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestlers</ENAMEX> only.
        The aim is for one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestler</ENAMEX> to force the other out of the
        ring or to make him touch the floor with anything other than his feet.
        The bout is usually over in one or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX>, sometimes mere <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>,
        but the intensity of the struggle and the sheer visual drama make for
        compelling entertainment.
        Sumo tournaments are held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuramae Kokugikan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fukuoka</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX>). The bouts commence in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, but the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> start arriving only in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX>. A
        little known secret is that a standing ticket (usually around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$12</NUMEX>)
        actually gives you the run of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arena</ENAMEX>: you can move around freely,
        sit in unoccupied <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seats</ENAMEX>, and even enjoy the action from the ringside
        until the actual ticket-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> arrive later on. If you can, go out of
        your way to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> of watching live sumo. There is simply
        nothing on earth like it.
        Martial arts. Most major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> have martial arts <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>,
        where you can watch kendo (fencing with bamboo staves) as well as the
        famed sports of judo and aikido. The latter is a highly spiritual art
        in which, unlike judo, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> do not grapple at the beginning of
        the bout. Instead, they maneuver and feint, applying the strength of
        their will (ki) rather than physical strength to overcome the
        other.
