        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> have always wanted to know what it means to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">a‚ÄÇFrench¬≠man.</ENAMEX> Their history has been a constant quest for national
        identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2000‚ÄÇb</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c. Celtic tribes ‚Äî</ENAMEX> probably from eastern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe ‚Äî</ENAMEX> came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now
        Franche-Comt√©, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alsace</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bur¬≠gundy.</ENAMEX> At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX> from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> were trickling into the south.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recorded settlement was the trading post set up by
        Phocaean <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massalia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mar¬≠seilles</ENAMEX>) around
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">600‚ÄÇb</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX> , followed by other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hy√®res</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antibes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nice</ENAMEX>. But
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX> in olives and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX>. When their
        position was threatened by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ligurian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> at sea and warlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>
        from inland, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marseilles</ENAMEX> called on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> for help.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
        In <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125‚ÄÇb</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> came in force, conquered the
        ‚ÄúGallic barbarians,‚Äù and set up a fortress at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquae</ENAMEX> Sextiae
        (Aix-en-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Provence</ENAMEX>). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Provincia (now Provence</ENAMEX>), stretching from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pyr√©n√©es</ENAMEX>, in
        order to guarantee communications between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. When this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius</ENAMEX> Caesar
        himself took charge, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conquering</ENAMEX> practically the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul</ENAMEX> by
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50‚ÄÇb</NUMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">c. Caesar</ENAMEX> drew <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul‚</ENAMEX>Äôs northeastern frontier at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhine</ENAMEX>, taking
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>, and warned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ger¬≠man¬≠ic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> across
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river ‚</ENAMEX>Äî the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franks</ENAMEX> (after whom <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is named), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alamans</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saxons ‚Äî</ENAMEX> would always threaten the security of the frontier.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romanization of Gaul</ENAMEX> sent the most energetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> to
        defend the outposts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> while their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> settled down to
        work the land or build <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arles</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N√Æmes</ENAMEX>,
        and the first <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">great highways</ENAMEX> between them. At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>
        built up a thriving trade with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. The
        pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> was thus
        established.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christianity</ENAMEX> was introduced into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaul</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a.d.</ENAMEX> , but was not really accepted until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late fourth century</TIMEX>, when
        it became the empire‚Äôs official religion. Large-scale conversions were
        led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin de Tours</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> turned cleric. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sword</ENAMEX> and cross were
        to form a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> history. ) The new religion soon
        cemented national solidarity in the face of more barbarian invasions,
        this time by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franks</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallic</ENAMEX> unity collapsed with the crumbling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. King
        Clovis, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franks</ENAMEX>, defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> at
        Sois¬≠sons in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">486</TIMEX> and won the allegiance of most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gallo-Romans</ENAMEX> by
        converting to Christianity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years later</TIMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> as his capital,
        he extended his rule to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Medi¬≠ter¬≠ra¬≠nean</ENAMEX>. The realm was divided up
        among his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heirs</ENAMEX> and progressively fragmented by the rivalries of the
        Merovingian dynasty that battled for power over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 300 years</TIMEX>.
        Despite this fragmentation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franks</ENAMEX> deeply impacted the
        cultural and linguistic heritage of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germanic</ENAMEX> traditions and
        language of the north became distinct from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gallo-Roman</ENAMEX> traditions
        longer preserved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Medi¬≠ter¬≠ra¬≠nean</ENAMEX> basin.
        Spain‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> exploited this disunity to sweep north
        across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaul</ENAMEX>, controlling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langue¬≠doc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dordogne</ENAMEX>, and a large part of
        Provence, before being defeated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poitiers</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">732</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Martel</ENAMEX>. Even the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlemagne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franks</ENAMEX> from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">768 to 814</TIMEX>, did not manage to create an enduring national unity; his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sons</ENAMEX> fought for the spoils of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normans</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scan¬≠di¬≠navia</ENAMEX> took advantage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolingian</ENAMEX> dynasty‚Äôs divided
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">kingdom</ENAMEX>, pillaging their way inland along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seine</ENAMEX>, and
        plundering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">845</TIMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saracens</ENAMEX> invaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proven√</ENAMEX>ßal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Magyar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lor¬≠raine</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bur¬≠gun¬≠dy.</ENAMEX> To keep the support of the nobles‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> had to
        give the nobles more and more land. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Con¬≠se¬≠quently</ENAMEX>, the realm broke up
        into the fiefdoms of the feudal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid¬</ENAMEX>≠dle <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ages</TIMEX>, precursors of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">country‚Äôs</NUMEX> classical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> ‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence, Bur¬≠gun¬≠dy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nor¬≠mandy</ENAMEX>,
        Brittany, and so forth.
        In the central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loire Valley</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugues Capet</ENAMEX> succeeded in achieving a precarious ascendancy, and was
        crowned the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">987</TIMEX>. As had happened at the fall of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Church</ENAMEX> provided the essential element
        of national unity. Hugues was anointed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reims</ENAMEX> with an oil said to
        have been brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> by the angels, thus establishing kingship by
        divine right for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Ages</ENAMEX>
        The alliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> served as the underpinning of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">regal</ENAMEX> authority. In exchange for the anointment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> was
        enriched with lands and the right of taxation by tithe, a percentage of
        the farmer‚Äôs seasonal produce.
        After the more sober spirituality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX>, the soaring Gothic cathedrals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chartres</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre-Dame</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bourges</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amiens</ENAMEX> were at once monuments to the glory
        of God and testimony to the sheer power, spiritual and temporal, of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic Church</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, dubbed by the pope ‚Äúeldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
        took the lead in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusades</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúinfidels‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>,
        stopping off on the way across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to massacre heretics and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infidels</ENAMEX>. Louis‚ÄÇIX of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, the ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> for the justice
        he handed down to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusades</ENAMEX> he led to the Holy
        Land, was sainted after his death in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tunis</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1270</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1309 to 1377</TIMEX>,
        Avignon was the papal seat.
        France‚Äôs other major preoccupation was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1066</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duc Guillaume</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy</ENAMEX> crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">English Channel</ENAMEX> in a successful
        military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campaign</ENAMEX> and became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Con¬≠queror.</ENAMEX> For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 400</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and French monarchs fought over the sovereignty of
        various parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> ‚Äî among them <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquitaine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touraine, Normandy</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flanders</ENAMEX>.
        Between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> ensued tangled marital alliances
        and military clashes more important to national morale than to
        resolving their perennial conflict ‚Äî such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bouvines</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1214</TIMEX>), a victory
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cr√©cy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">1346) and Agincourt</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1415</TIMEX>) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, a teenager from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorraine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeanne d‚ÄôArc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Joan of Arc</ENAMEX>), roused
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> to resist the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orl√©ans.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> captured her
        and burned her at the stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rouen</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1431</TIMEX>, but her martyrdom stirred
        national pride sufficiently to oust the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 20 years
        later.
        The disputes among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nobles</ENAMEX> were not the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of
        ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. To the common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, wars were just another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hardship</ENAMEX>, taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> to fight, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> ‚Äî
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as much as foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äî</ENAMEX> ravaged the land or pillaged the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>.
        During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">war</ENAMEX> and peace alike in this feudal age, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and the
        aristocracy continued to claim their respective portions of the
        peasants‚Äô labor, leaving barely enough for subsistence. All too
        frequently a cycle of drought, famine, and plague would decimate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        In any case, large portions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> were independently
        controlled by powerful dukes whose allegiance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> was only
        nominal. The modern unity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> was in the making.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ancien R√</ENAMEX>©gime
        Absolute power was the dominant feature of what
        post-Revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancien R√©gime.</ENAMEX> The monarchy made
        noticeable gains under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fran√ßois‚ÄÇI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1515‚Äì47</ENAMEX>). He strengthened central
        administration and abandoned an initially tolerant policy toward the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX>. A debonair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> of the arts, he
        introduced a grandiose style at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√ßois</ENAMEX> brought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX> to work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blois</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosso</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primaticcio</ENAMEX> to decorate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fontainebleau</ENAMEX>. He also commissioned
        paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titian</ENAMEX> for the royal collections that are now
        the pride of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Louvre</ENAMEX>. A new opulent architecture blossomed with the
        ch√¢teaux of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire</ENAMEX> and around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. In foreign affairs, after he
        had crushed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marignano</ENAMEX> and formed a showy
        alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry VIII of England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fran√ßois I‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> ambitions
        were halted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles‚ÄÇV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran√ßois</ENAMEX> even suffered the
        indignity of a year‚Äôs imprisonment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, following a resounding
        defeat at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pavia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1525</TIMEX>.
        The bloody <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> conflicts between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prot¬≠es¬≠tants</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> centered more on political and
        financial intrigue than on questions of theology. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Wars of
        Religion pitted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of the regent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine de M√</ENAMEX>©dicis
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huguenot</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri de Navarre</ENAMEX>.
        Their crisis came on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 August 1572</TIMEX> with the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bar¬≠thol¬≠o¬≠mew‚Äôs Day Massacre</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Henri‚Äôs wedding to Catherine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marguerite de Valois</ENAMEX>, were
        killed. The general massacre of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> spread to the countryside,
        and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> had lost their lives.
        The conciliatory policies that painfully emerged after the
        bloodshed brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navarre</ENAMEX> to the throne as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri‚ÄÇIV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1589‚Äì1610</ENAMEX>), but not before he promised to convert to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathol¬≠icism.</ENAMEX> The enormous personal popularity of this good-natured but
        tough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pyr√©n√©es</ENAMEX> proved vital for healing the wounds from
        the bitter wars. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edict of Nantes</ENAMEX> was signed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1598</TIMEX> to protect the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prot¬≠es¬≠tants</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years later</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX> were allowed back into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri</ENAMEX> maintained a reputation as a worthy and brave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> ‚Äî
        and at the same time as an incorrigible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">womanizer ‚Äî</ENAMEX> until his
        assassination in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1610</TIMEX> by a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">zealot</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> floundered in uncertainty under the regency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie de M√©dicis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Louis‚ÄÇXIII</ENAMEX>, until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardinal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richelieu</ENAMEX> took charge as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1624</TIMEX>. Directing national
        policy until his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1642</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richelieu</ENAMEX> reasserted the authority of
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> against both the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX> who surrounded the
        queen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that were fiercely defending the
        privileges granted them by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edict of Nantes</ENAMEX>. With his successful
        siege of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> stronghold at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Rochelle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX>
        neutralized the threat of their military strength while guaranteeing
        their freedom of worship.
        Richelieu‚Äôs major achievement was the greater
        centralization of royal power, laying the foundations of the strong
        sense of national identity that has characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> ever since. He
        tightened the king‚Äôs control over legislation and taxes, enraging the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> by daring to impose a new levy on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>. More powerful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stewards</ENAMEX> were sent out to diminish the autonomy of the regional
        parlements, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">councils</ENAMEX> with judicial rather than legislative functions,
        dominated by the high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> and the nobles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> also created
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1635</TIMEX> to ensure the purity and clarity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> language through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictionnaire</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grammaire</ENAMEX>.
        Promoting overseas trade and the founding of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richelieu</ENAMEX> also launched <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> with the
        colonization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinique</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of practical politics, was not above
        supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant Swedish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Danish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Thirty Years‚Äô War</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Austrians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. All that mattered was that it served <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France‚Äôs</ENAMEX> interests.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richelieu‚Äôs prot√©g√© Mazarin</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX>, took over
        the job of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> during the minority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXIV.</ENAMEX> The court
        and regional aristocracy were infuriated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>-born
        churchman‚Äôs intimate relationship with the king‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>. Nor did they like his astounding knack for amassing a vast
        personal fortune while managing, very efficiently, the affairs of
        state. But most of all, they despised the way he eroded the nobles‚Äô
        power and smoothed the path to an increasingly absolutist monarchy.
        The revolts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fronde</ENAMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazarin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy-king</ENAMEX> to flee from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1649</TIMEX>. However, the royal family‚Äôs
        triumphant return <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</TIMEX>, with the rebellious nobles
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crushed</ENAMEX>, saw the monarchy stronger than ever.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚ÄÇXIV</ENAMEX> drew his own conclusions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazarin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs careful
        coaching in affairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. When he began his personal rule in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1661</TIMEX>,
        at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age of 23</TIMEX>, there was no question of a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>
        impinging on the royal prerogative. Adopting the unequivocal emblem of
        the sun, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> was to be outshone by no one. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Counselors</ENAMEX> were wholly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subservient</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> never once called upon the parliamentary assembly of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Etats g√©n√©raux</ENAMEX>. He moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>, impoverished the
        nobility by forcing them to contribute to the incredible luxury of his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX>, and imposed as their sole function the support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of war.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX> was truly the shining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> by its
        architectural splendor, and most of all by the sheer hypnotic power of
        Louis‚ÄÇXIV‚Äôs cult of self-glorification. In his lifetime, many petty
        Euro¬≠pean princes tried to imitate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louis‚Äôs</ENAMEX> style with their own little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX>, complete with court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sycophants</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>
        was not without cost. It took <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> a long time to come to
        terms with the less attractive realities of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚</ENAMEX>Äôs style cost the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>.
        To enhance his glory, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun King</ENAMEX> turned to foreign
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conquest</ENAMEX>. The devastating military expedition he launched across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhineland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palatinate</ENAMEX>, and the series of largely fruitless wars with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> did not endear him to the European
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Moreover, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ventures</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚Äôs</ENAMEX> once-thriving economy in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ruins</ENAMEX>.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, his authoritarian rule required a brutal police
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>. Taxes soared to pay for his wars, and more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> had
        to abandon their fields when press-ganged into his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX>. Influenced
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> life by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">piety</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madame de Maintenon</ENAMEX>, his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mistress</ENAMEX> and subsequently secret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louis</ENAMEX> put an end to religious
        freedom for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX> by revoking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edict of Nantes</ENAMEX>. In the face of
        forced conversions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant Huguenots</ENAMEX> ‚Äî many of them the most
        talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bankers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, and artisans of their generation ‚Äî fled to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1715</TIMEX>. Having outlived his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grand¬≠children</ENAMEX>, he was succeeded by his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-grandson</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXV.</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was in the hands of the late king‚Äôs cultured,
        libertine, and atheist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans</ENAMEX>.
        After the morose twilight years of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun King</ENAMEX>, the
        societal tone changed with the satiric pen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voltaire</ENAMEX> and the erotic
        fantasies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watteau‚</ENAMEX>Äôs paintings and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Marivaux‚Äôs</ENAMEX> comedies. The court
        moved back from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. The generally lazy regent gave
        incompetent nobles too much of a say in the running of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        Regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parlements</ENAMEX> obtained the right to make protest, and the
        monarchy gradually weakened.
        The easy-going <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXV</ENAMEX> was called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bien-Aim√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beloved</ENAMEX>),
        at least in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half</TIMEX> of his reign. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> seemed more
        interested in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistresses</ENAMEX> than in running a tight ship of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        Despite this (or perhaps because of it) the economy recovered and the
        middle classes strengthened. The overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> expanded in the East
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX>, and arts and letters flourished in this age of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enlightenment</ENAMEX>.
        But the new voices were a clear threat to the established
        order. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diderot‚Äôs Encyclop√</ENAMEX>©die championed reason over traditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religion, Rousseau</ENAMEX> discoursed on the origins of inequality, Voltaire
        shot at everything that didn‚Äôt move.
        Revolution and Napoleon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚ÄÇXVI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXV</ENAMEX>, found himself attacked on
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>. The stubborn aristocracy and high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> were anxious to
        protect their ancient privileges; a burgeoning bourgeoisie longed for
        reforms that would give them greater opportunity; the peasantry was no
        longer prepared to bear the burden of feudal extortion; and a growing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX> of artisans groaned under intolerable hardships.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etats g√©n√©raux</ENAMEX> convened for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">175‚ÄÇyears</NUMEX>. It was clearly the king‚Äôs enduring absolutism rather than
        the throne itself that was under fire. For reactionary nobles, the king
        was the guarantor of their hereditary status. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Liberal reformers</ENAMEX> wanted
        a constitutional monarchy similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, not a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>. Even
        the grievances drawn up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">townspeople</ENAMEX> insisted on
        continuing devotion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> himself.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two months later</TIMEX>, the blindness of the king‚Äôs conservative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisors</ENAMEX> and the king‚Äôs own weakness and vacillation led to the
        explosion of centuries of frustration and rage ‚Äî which culminated in
        the storming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bastille</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">regime‚Äôs prison</ENAMEX>-fortress in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>. On
        that fateful day, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14‚</NUMEX>ÄÇJuly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> went hunting near his ch√¢teau
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis ‚Äî</ENAMEX> apparently oblivious to
        events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> ‚Äî wrote in his diary, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúRien‚Äù (‚ÄúNothing‚Äù</ENAMEX>).
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly</ENAMEX> voted a charter for liberty and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">equality</ENAMEX>, the great <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Citizen</ENAMEX>. The aristocracy‚Äôs feudal rights were abolished, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        massive land-holdings confiscated and sold off.
        Rather than compromise, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> fled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> in a vain
        effort to join up with armed forces hostile to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>. With
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austrian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> massing on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs frontiers and the forces
        of counter-revolution gathering inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, the militant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">revolutionary Jacobins</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max¬≠i¬≠milien de Robespierre</ENAMEX> saw the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">king‚Äôs</ENAMEX> flight as the ultimate betrayal. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> was declared in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1792</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXVI</ENAMEX> was guillotined in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1793</TIMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis‚ÄÇXVII</ENAMEX> died in
        obscure circumstances under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revolutionary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, probably in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1795</TIMEX>.
        Under pressure from the poorer classes, who did not want
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX> appropriated for the exclusive benefit of the
        bourgeoisie, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jacobin</ENAMEX>-led revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> ordered sweeping
        measures of economic and social reform, which were accompanied by a
        wave of mass executions, the Terror, aimed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderates</ENAMEX> as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aristocrats</ENAMEX>. Despite his attempts to quell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>, Robespierre
        was overthrown and guillotined in the counterattack of the propertied
        classes.
        During their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directoire</ENAMEX>, a new wave of executions ‚Äî the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX> (royalist) Terror ‚Äî decimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobins</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX>.
        But the bourgeoisie, fearing both the royalists and their foreign
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">backers</ENAMEX>, turned for salvation to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Corsican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldier</ENAMEX> triumphantly
        campaigning against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rev¬≠o¬≠lution‚Äôs</ENAMEX> foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> ‚Äî Napoleon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonaparte</ENAMEX>.
        In between defeating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aus¬</ENAMEX>≠trians in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> and a less
        successful campaign against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brit¬</ENAMEX>≠ish in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1795</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bona¬</ENAMEX>≠parte
        re¬≠turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> to crush the royalists, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years later</TIMEX> he
        staged a coup against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Direc¬≠toire.</ENAMEX> He was just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years old</TIMEX>.
        In the first flush of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Consul</ENAMEX>, he
        established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque de France</ENAMEX>, created state-run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lyc√</ENAMEX>©es (high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>), and gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> its first national set of laws, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Code</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napol√©on.</ENAMEX> The centralization dear to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richelieu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXIV</ENAMEX> was
        becoming a reality.
        The supreme self-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonaparte</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1804</TIMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>
        Napoleon at a coronation ceremony in which he audaciously took the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown</ENAMEX> of golden laurels from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> and placed it on his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. He
        managed to simultaneously pursue foreign conquests in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> and domestic reforms that included a modernized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police force</ENAMEX>, and proper supplies of drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pari¬≠sians.</ENAMEX>
        During his disastrous campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, he found time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> to
        draw up a new statute for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Com√©die-Fran√ßaise</ENAMEX> (the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>),
        which had been dissolved during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>.
        The nationalism that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> invoked in his conquest of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚Äôs Ancien R√©gime</ENAMEX> turned against him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. The monarchies regrouped to force him from power in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1814</TIMEX>.
        Nevertheless, he made a brilliant but brief comeback <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äî</ENAMEX> before an alliance of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prussian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Belgian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>
        inflicted the final defeat at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterloo</ENAMEX>.
        Toward Democracy
        At the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Napoleonic</ENAMEX> era, the monarchy was
        restored. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis‚ÄÇXVIII</ENAMEX>, tried at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to reconcile the
        restored monarchy with the reforms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Revo¬≠lution and Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">empire</ENAMEX>. But his nobles were intent on revenge and imposed a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
        even more violent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White Terror</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonapartists</ENAMEX>,
        including some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>.
        Louis‚Äôs reactionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles‚ÄÇX</ENAMEX>, was
        interested only in renewing the traditions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancien R√©gime</ENAMEX>, even
        having himself anointed and crowned at the ancient cathedral of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reims</ENAMEX>.
        But the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were no longer prepared to tolerate the
        restraints on their freedom, nor the worsening condition of the economy
        in the hands of an incompetent aristocracy. They reasserted their
        rights in the insurrection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1830</TIMEX> ‚Äî the kind of liberal
        revolution they would have preferred back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1789</TIMEX> ‚Äî paving the way for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbourgeois monarchy‚Äù</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Philippe</ENAMEX>.
        This last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> of the progressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orl√</ENAMEX>©ans
        branch of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, encouraged the country‚Äôs exploitation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Industrial Revolution</ENAMEX> and the complementary extension of its
        overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX> had been occupied just
        before the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1830 revolution</ENAMEX>). But the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> created an urban
        working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> clamoring for improvement of its miserable working and
        living conditions. The r√©gime‚Äôs response of ferocious repression plus
        numerous other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ineptitudes</ENAMEX> led to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> revolution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX>, with the
        Bonapartists, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, emerging triumphant.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Republic</ENAMEX> ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years later</TIMEX> when the man
        whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúNapol√©on le Petit‚</ENAMEX>Äù staged a coup to become
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Napoleon III</ENAMEX>. Determined to cloak himself in the legend of his
        uncle‚Äôs grandeur, he saw his own role as that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. But he used harsh anti-press laws and loyalty oaths to quell
        the libertarian spirit that had brought him to power.
        The economy flourished thanks to the expansion of a
        vigorous entrepreneurial capitalism in iron, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>,
        augmented by overseas ventures such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX>. Despite the
        emperor‚Äôs obsession with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúRed Peril‚Äù ‚</ENAMEX>Äî the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX>
        Mani¬≠festo of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engels</ENAMEX>, which was being circulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> ‚Äî he
        could not prevent such social reforms as the workers‚Äô right to form
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> and even to strike.
        With the excessive enthusiasm that characterized the age,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haussmann‚</ENAMEX>Äôs urban planning redeveloped old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> neighborhoods
        to create a more airy and spacious capital. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Viollet-le-Duc</ENAMEX> often went overboard restoring some of the great Gothic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedrals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medieval ch√¢teaux</ENAMEX> in ways their original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creators</ENAMEX> had
        never imagined.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Hugo</ENAMEX>, in exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guernsey</ENAMEX>, was writing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mis√©rables</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baudelaire</ENAMEX> was working on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Fleurs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">du Mal</ENAMEX>, and
        Offenbach was composing jolly operettas, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Belle H√©l√®ne</ENAMEX>.
        Courbet was painting his vast canvases of provincial life, and Manet
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">D√©jeuner sur l‚ÄôHerbe</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society</ENAMEX> was optimistic. The bourgeoisie showed off its new
        prosperity with extravagant furnishings, silks, satins, and baubles,
        and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1852</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> opened its first department store, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Au Bon March√©</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> was developing a national identity of optimism, a high level of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> critique, and constant pressure for improvement.
        But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> had an account to settle. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX>, Prussian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chan¬≠cellor Bismarck</ENAMEX> exploited an obscure diplomatic conflict with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> to unite the various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> principalities and kingdoms into a
        fighting force <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> equipped for war. After a lightning victory over
        the ill-prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> marched on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and laid
        siege to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which finally capitulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1871</TIMEX> in the
        face of dwindling food supplies. As part of the settlement ending the
        war, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alsace</ENAMEX> and a portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorraine</ENAMEX> were ceded to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Republic</ENAMEX>
        Defeat shattered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Empire</ENAMEX>. While the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third</ENAMEX>
        Repub¬≠lic‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolphe Thiers</ENAMEX> negotiated the terms of
        surrender, the workers‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">communes</ENAMEX> refused to give in. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1871</TIMEX> they
        took over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and a few provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, and held out for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> brave
        but desperately disorganized <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> they were brutally
        crushed by government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> and order was restored.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> resumed its industrial progress, quickly paid off
        its enormous war-reparations debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, and expanded its overseas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empire</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indochina</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rediscovered</ENAMEX> national
        pride found its perfect expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX>, thrust into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> skies for the international exhibition of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impressionism</ENAMEX> had blown
        away the dust and cobwebs of the artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Novelist Emile</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Zola</ENAMEX> poured forth arguments against industrial exploitation. Rodin,
        more restrained, sculpted masterpieces such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Penseur</ENAMEX> (The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thinker</ENAMEX>). Leading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúrepub¬≠lican‚Äù hostility</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        entrenched position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jules Ferry</ENAMEX> enacted the
        legislation that has formed the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs formidable state
        education system ever since.
        On the right, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalist forces</ENAMEX> were motivated by a desire
        to hit back at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, seeing all contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> or any form
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúcosmopolitanism‚Äù</ENAMEX> as a threat to national honor and integrity. For
        many, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were the embodiment of this threat <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äî Edouard Drumont‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vehemently anti-Semitic La France Juive</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>) was a runaway
        national bestseller. It appeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1886</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Captain</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Dreyfus</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Alsatian Jew</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Army</ENAMEX>, was arrested on
        what proved to be trumped-up charges of spying for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>. In a
        case that pitted the fragile honor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> against the very
        survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French republican</ENAMEX> democracy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> had to wait <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> for full rehabilitation.
        The desire for revenge against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> remained. And as
        Ger¬≠many‚Äôs own imperial ambitions grew, competition for world markets
        became intense. Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> went enthusiastically into <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>,
        and came out of it victorious yet bled white. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1919 Treaty</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Versailles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> recovered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alsace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorraine</ENAMEX>; but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,350,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had
        been lost in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> of fighting. The national economy was
        shattered, and political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> were more extreme than ever.
        In face of the fears aroused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Revolution of</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>, the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> dominated the immediate post-war period,
        while a new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX>, loyal to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX>, split with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialists</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> seemed less aware of the threat from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> to remilitarize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhineland</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX> in
        breach of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Versailles Treaty</ENAMEX>, a step <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> later said he had never
        dreamt of getting away with.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, extreme right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fran¬≠√ßaise</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Croix</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de-Feu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross of Fire</ENAMEX>) provided a strong
        anti¬≠democratic undercurrent to the political turmoil of financial
        scandal and parliamentary corruption. The bloody <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX> riots on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Place de la</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Concorde</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> offered a disturbing echo to the street
        fighting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fascist Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nazi Germany</ENAMEX>.
        The left-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> re¬≠spond¬≠ed by banding together in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Front</ENAMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Socialists</ENAMEX> led to power in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>. Within the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few weeks</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L√©on Blum‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> nationalized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>,
        brought in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40-hour week</TIMEX>, and instituted the workers‚Äô first holidays
        with pay. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> broke the alliance after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blum</ENAMEX> first failed
        to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX> and then ‚Äî faced
        with financial difficulties ‚Äî put a brake on the reforms.
        War and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace</ENAMEX>
        Blum‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX>, and the new prime
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edouard Daladier</ENAMEX>, found himself negotiating the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX>
        agreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Britain‚Äôs Neville Chamberlain</ENAMEX>. A
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> was once again at war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>.
        Relying too complacently on the defensive strategy of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortified Maginot Line</ENAMEX> along the northeast frontier with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> (but
        not facing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> were totally unprepared for the German
        invasion across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ardennes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1940</TIMEX>. With fast-moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> and
        superior air power, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> reached <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days later</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Marshal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe P√©tain</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, capitulated on behalf of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 16</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days later</TIMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> radio‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> de‚ÄÇGaulle appealed for national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
        Compared with other occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denmark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs collaboration with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inglorious</ENAMEX> story. Based in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Auvergnat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> town of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vichy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        government often proved more zealous than its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> in suppressing
        civil liberties and drawing up anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> legislation. It was French
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> who rounded up the deportees for the concentration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>, many
        of them denounced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> seeking to profit from the
        confiscation of property. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> of the underground <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resistance</ENAMEX>
        movement were heroic, but they were a tiny minority, a few of them
        conservative patriots like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">de‚ÄÇGaulle</ENAMEX>, most of them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">socialists</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">communists</ENAMEX>, and also a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refugees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deliverance</ENAMEX> came when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Allies</ENAMEX> landed on the beaches of
        Normandy on D<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-Day</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6‚ÄÇJune 1944</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De‚ÄÇGaulle</ENAMEX>, with his canny sense of
        history, took an important step toward rebuilding national
        self-confidence by insisting that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> armed forces fight side by
        side with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> for the liberation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
        but, above all, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>
        itself.
        After the high emotion of de‚ÄÇGaulle‚Äôs march down the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs-Elys√©es</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> of post-war reconstruction, though boosted
        by the generous aid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Americans‚Äô Mar¬≠shall Plan</ENAMEX>, proved arduous,
        and the wartime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> of de‚ÄÇGaulle‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX>
        Party soon broke down. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> could not tolerate the political
        squabbles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth Republic</ENAMEX> and withdrew from public life.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Governments</ENAMEX> changed repeatedly, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> muddled
        through. Intellectuals debated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">existentialist</ENAMEX> merit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Camus</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Paul Sartre</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris‚Äôs Left Bank</ENAMEX> caf√©s.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> was collapsing. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fruitless
        last stand in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Mend√</ENAMEX>®s-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> wisely negotiated an
        Indochinese peace settlement. He handed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pondicherry</ENAMEX> over to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tunisia</ENAMEX> its independence, but was
        ousted from office as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostilities</ENAMEX> broke out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De‚ÄÇGaulle</ENAMEX> returned from the wilderness in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, ostensibly
        to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. But he‚Äôd seen the writing on the wall and
        brought the war to an end with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> independence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>. His major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX> was to rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> from the chaos of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth Republic</ENAMEX>. The
        new constitution, tailor-made to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Gaulle‚</ENAMEX>Äôs authoritarian
        requirements, placed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX>, where he could
        pursue his own policies outside the messy arena of party politics.
        However, the colonial struggles in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> were to have
        significant impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> national identity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX>. As the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">empire</ENAMEX> receded, colonized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North and Central Africa</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indochina</ENAMEX>, and elsewhere began to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and alter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        identity once more.
        De‚ÄÇGaulle‚Äôs visions of grandeur, and of a country
        independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX>, gave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> a renewed
        self-confidence. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of his great achievements was a close alliance
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX>, overcoming centuries of bloodshed be¬≠tween the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peoples</ENAMEX>.
        But with self-confidence came complacency, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        bourgeoisie was cast again onto shifting ground with the massive
        student rebellions of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚Äúevents of May‚</ENAMEX>Äù that erupted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin Quarter</ENAMEX> and swiftly spread through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> disturbed
        de‚ÄÇGaulle enough for him to seek reassurance with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> stationed
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were reluctant to make a complete change
        until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> for reform gathered sufficient strength to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">elect Fran√ßois Mitterrand</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifth Republic‚</ENAMEX>Äôs first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Front</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> began
        with a quick-fire set of reforms ‚Äî a broad program of nationalization,
        abolition of the death penalty, raising the minimum wage, and the
        introduction of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth week of holiday</TIMEX> with pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äî until the impact of
        the world economic crisis imposed a necessary brake. Special emphasis
        was placed on cultural programs, with generous subsidies for theater,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cinema</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, and also for scientific research.
        Probably the most important reform was the least glamorous:
        the decentralization that increased regional autonomy and reversed the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-old</TIMEX> trend of concentrating political, economic, and administrative
        power in the national <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. By allowing the local pride of such
        historic regions as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence, Normandy, Brittany</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langue¬</ENAMEX>≠doc to
        reassert itself, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> demonstrated that it was at last secure in its
        national identity ‚Äî so secure that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> even began carrying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> passports. As a founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euro¬≠pean Community</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> looked to a wider, continental challenge in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>.
        Yet modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> struggles with similar identity issues as
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> with
        non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> heritage is substantial, reviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationalist</ENAMEX> sentiment in
        the form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Front National</ENAMEX>. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> experiences
        diversity and tension within cultural, social, and political spheres.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that won the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1998 World Cup</ENAMEX> was deemed by some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unsuitable</ENAMEX> to represent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> because of the mixed heritage of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX>. At the same time, the team accurately reflected the social
        diversity that exists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
        New corporate and fast-food cultures, along with more
        freedom of movement among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and a more
        international perspective, have further changed the social landscape.
        Today, the onion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> with beret and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX> is becoming as much an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anomaly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs urban and suburban setting as he would be in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.
