        As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> has moved resolutely into the modern age, it has
        also remained, culturally and historically, a rich, multi-layered blend
        of traditions wrapped up within a modern, busy economy. From sandy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beaches</ENAMEX>, broad brown rivers, and deep forests, to rising skyscrapers
        and wide expressways, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> is set to exceed <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">visitorsâ</NUMEX>€™
        expectations.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> see the traditional juxtaposed with the modern
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinatown</ENAMEX> shophouses, among the vibrancy and aromas of popular
        night markets, and even in the modern shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>. They see
        architectural splendor among the many mosques, the incense-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Petronas Twin Towers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>.
        History can be lived and felt amid the longhouses of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawarak</ENAMEX>,
        in the kite-flying and top-spinning traditions of northeastern
        Kelantan, in the many graceful and beautiful dance and story-telling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traditions</ENAMEX>, and in the vibrant colors of batik art.
        Your gateway to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> will probably be through its
        capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>, a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of broad expressways, skyscrapers,
        and green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> to balance the urban sprawl. Prosperous and colorful,
        it is well prepared to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next millennium</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>: the peninsula,
        bordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, the Straits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX>;
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Malaysia</ENAMEX>, whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawarak</ENAMEX>, are located
        on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Borneo</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 800 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">500 miles</NUMEX>) across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX>. These latter vast regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX>, rivers, and mountains border
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX> state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalimantan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultanate</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brunei</ENAMEX>. Industry and urban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">society</ENAMEX> are concentrated on the peninsula,
        especially on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> coast, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Malaysia</ENAMEX> is dominated by the
        countryâ€™s characteristic impenetrable jungle. Malaysiaâ€™s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts
        share a hot, humid climate, but differ greatly in population density
        and urban development.
        Malaysiaâ€™s relative wealth is reflected in the excellent
        network of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and a good railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> along the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">peninsulaâ€™s</NUMEX> west
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>. Its per capita income is one of the highest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>,
        bettered only by that of neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Some 40 percent</NUMEX> of
        Malaysians live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">townships</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, an
        exceptional proportion for the region. Its mortality rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> places it on a par with major industrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natureâ€™s Supremacy</ENAMEX>
        Whether you are staying at beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> or visiting the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, you will always find the jungle ready to reassert its rights.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX> is also a constant presence, sometimes as waves lapping on white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sandy</ENAMEX> beaches, or as beautiful cascading waterfalls, or as majestic,
        wide rivers running snake-like across the land, forcing apart forest
        cover before reaching the sea.
        Even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpurâ</ENAMEX>€‚â€”â€‚as modern an urban sprawl as you
        could imagine, criss-crossed by expressways and bristling with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">skyscrapersâ€‚â€”â€‚a</ENAMEX> construction site abandoned a moment too long to the
        tropical sun and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> will soon sprout a luxuriant growth of lallang
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferns</ENAMEX> and wild creepers.
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the centuries</TIMEX>, the countryâ€™s prosperity has come from
        its coastal plains, wider on the west than the east side of the
        peninsula. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> as a trading point for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>,
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malacca</ENAMEX> in colonial times) and later
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>, now sovereign and independent. Then came tin mining and
        rubber <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>, and, more recently, palm oil, hardwood <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX>, and
        offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">petroleum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> paddies in the northwest towards the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> border and around river deltas on the east coast serve only
        domestic consumption.
        Mangrove swamps along the coast and squat nipa <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> give
        rise to mangrove jungle. The worldâ€™s oldest rainforests engulf low but
        steeply rising mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> that cross the peninsula from east to
        west like ribs, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> long northâ€“south <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Range</ENAMEX> as their backbone.
        Until the highway construction in the modern era, access to the jungle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> had beenâ€‚â€”â€‚and in some cases, still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">isâ€‚â€”â€‚only</ENAMEX> by river. The
        river-beds are mostly too shallow for anything but flat-bottomed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boats</ENAMEX>.
        On the great island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borneo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Malaysiaâ€™s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX> surround the enclave of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultanate</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brunei</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Plantations alternate</ENAMEX> with marshland on the coastal plain
        before giving way to the all-powerful jungle of the interior.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation</ENAMEX> is hindered by sandbars at the mouth and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rapids upriver</ENAMEX>,
        though small, sea-going <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> can make fair headway up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rejang</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarawak</ENAMEX> and up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinabatangan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sabah</ENAMEX>. To the south, a natural
        barrier of mountain ranges comprises the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalimantan</ENAMEX>. Near the coast at the northern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Crocker Range</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Kinabalu</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13,450 ft</NUMEX>) the highest peak in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and a favorite with climbers, both professional and amateur.
        With the growth of tourism as a major industry, resort
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> have burgeoned in smaller islands such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Penang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pangkor</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langkawi</ENAMEX> on the west coast of the peninsula, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tioman</ENAMEX> on the east
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>, and around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sabahâ€™s</ENAMEX> offshore nature reserve near Kota
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinabalu</ENAMEX>.
        Top of a Quiet World
        In an era of seemingly perpetual ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostilities</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> can be proud of a unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">achievementâ€‚â€”â€‚the coexistence</ENAMEX> of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> most prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> (mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        (mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> (many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX>). Despite occasional
        conflicts, they live in a remarkable state of harmony. It is not
        unusual to find, as in old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melaka</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> on the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. Not least of all, it makes for a marvellous
        diversity in the national cuisines, with food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> often serving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> dishes at adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX>).
        With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> as the national religion and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Malayâ€‚â€”â</ENAMEX>€‚Bahasa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malaysiaâ€‚â€”â</ENAMEX>€‚as the national language, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> enjoy practically exclusive
        access to the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> at federal and state
        level. They share a common ancestry with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">archipelago</ENAMEX>. At the upper end of the social scale, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> make up the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> of the sultanatesâ€‚â€”â€‚country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX> enjoying an occasional
        game of polo and the other good things in life. Farther down, urban
        Malays form a modern bourgeoisie, cultivating contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> and keeping only a remote eye on their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country estates</ENAMEX>. The
        more prosperous send their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and other overseas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>.
        The bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> at large are humbler
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>- and village-dwelling <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peopleâ€‚â€”â€‚tending goats</ENAMEX> and buffaloes,
        growing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, and working in the coconut, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rubber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">timber</ENAMEX>, rattan, and
        bamboo industries. Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> ritual is still colored by the ancient
        customs of pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim Malaya</ENAMEX>, so a mild-mannered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunnite</ENAMEX> version of the
        Muslim religion is often seasoned, amid this all-pervasive nature, with
        a generous spoonful of the more ancient beliefs of animist
        medicine-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.
        Economic development has given younger <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysians</ENAMEX> wider
        choices than in previous generations. Access to these choices will
        prove a necessity as the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of business and community
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> prepare to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malays</ENAMEX> have a perfect understanding of their tropical
        climate. They know how important it is to keep cool and calm and move
        around slowly. Their relaxed attitude and their constant smiles are
        delightfully infectious to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newcomer</ENAMEX>, who soon learns to shrug off
        the stresses of modern life.
