        The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Turkey</ENAMEX> dates only from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>, but the
        history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of
        humanity. Widespread finds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> implements in cave excavations
        show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX> was already inhabited during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle</TIMEX> of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Palaeolithic</TIMEX> period (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 200,000 to 40,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>). By Neolithic
        times, organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> had arisen, such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">√áatalh√∂y√ºk,</ENAMEX>
        near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Konya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turkey‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important prehistoric site. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which
        flourished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 6500 and 5500</TIMEX> b.c. , had flat-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of mud
        and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns
        that still appear on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolian</ENAMEX> kilims.
        The advent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX> (about 3200 b.c. ), and the
        spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">city-states</ENAMEX> ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, is marked by the appearance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> tombs containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> objects in such places as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">west</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alacah√∂y√ºk</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ankara</ENAMEX>. Around this time the Sumerian
        civilization living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX> (the region between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tigris</ENAMEX> and
        Euphrates rivers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>) founded and developed the
        cuneiform script, the world‚Äôs oldest form of writing on record. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> was introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assyrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years later</TIMEX> in¬≠to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>, where it was qui¬≠ck¬≠ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who, at this point, had already reached an ad¬≠¬≠vanced state of
        civilization.
        The Hittites
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hatti</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kanesh</ENAMEX> (modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">K√ºltepe</ENAMEX>, near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kayseri</ENAMEX>). Cuneiform <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> found here record the arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>
        of warlike invaders around the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mill¬≠ennium b.c. Their origins
        remain a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">my¬≠s¬≠tery</ENAMEX> (their written language was finally deciphered in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX>), but they came from the direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucasus</ENAMEX> moun¬≠tains,
        spreading destruction and disorder throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>. It was two
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years</TIMEX> before they were firmly entrenched in their newly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conquered</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hittites</ENAMEX>, and their domination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX> can be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct periods: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Kingdom</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1600‚Äì1450 b.c.</ENAMEX> ), then the New or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire Period</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1450‚Äì1200 b.c.</ENAMEX>
        ), and the Late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hittite Period</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c. 1200‚Äì700 b.c.</ENAMEX> ). Their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> capital
        city was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hattusa (now Bo‚Äòazk√∂y</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ankara</ENAMEX>), which dates from the 13th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century b.c.</ENAMEX> and has tombs, fortifications, enclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>, and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel</ENAMEX> containing an impressive library of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,300</NUMEX> cuneiform
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX>.
        During the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire Period</ENAMEX>, an ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hittite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>,
        Mutawallis, defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharaoh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses II</ENAMEX>, at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kadesh</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1285</TIMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses</ENAMEX> was too proud to accept defeat,
        commissioning obelisks that celebrated his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúvictory</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù But he was
        sufficiently wary of the formidable strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hittite Empire</ENAMEX> to
        make peace with the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hattusili III</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of Kadesh</ENAMEX>,
        recorded on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay tablets</ENAMEX> on display in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Ancient Orient</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>), is the oldest known example of an
        international treaty.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hittite Empire</ENAMEX> eventually collapsed following invasion
        from the west by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Achaeans</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phrygians</ENAMEX>, and a mysterious force
        known only as the ‚ÄúSea <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hittites</ENAMEX> were forced to flee south
        into the mountains, where they remained until they were absorbed by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assyrians</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Troy</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>
        While the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hittite Empire</ENAMEX> declined, other momentous events
        were taking place on the shores of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>. The ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>
        traditionally took the fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX>, as recounted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>, as the
        starting point of their history. Much academic debate surrounds the
        exact date of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Trojan War</ENAMEX>, if indeed it ever took place. Modern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeologists</ENAMEX> studying the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> have discovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
        superimposed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> I (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3000‚Äì2500 b.c.</ENAMEX> ) to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">350 b.c. ‚Äìa.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">d. 400</ENAMEX>); the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King Priam</ENAMEX>, described in the Iliad
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odyssey</ENAMEX>, is thought to be either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Troy VI</ENAMEX>, which was destroyed
        by an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1275</TIMEX> b.c. , or its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Troy VIIa</ENAMEX>. Some say
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Trojan War</ENAMEX> never took place at all, and that the decline of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX>
        was due to the mysterious <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúSea People‚</ENAMEX>Äù mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>.
        Whatever really happened, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mycenaean Greeks</ENAMEX> who were
        supposed to have conquered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priam‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> soon found their own
        civilization in decline. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">race</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorians</ENAMEX> came to power in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">south¬≠¬≠ern Greece</ENAMEX>, forcing many mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> to leave their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>
        and cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> to settle on the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>. Their
        colonization of the coast took place in successive waves of
        immigration. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> came the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeolians</ENAMEX>, who settled the region to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north of Smyrna</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izmir</ENAMEX>), then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionians</ENAMEX>, who settled the coast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south of Smyrna</ENAMEX> as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Maeander</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dorians</ENAMEX> followed,
        installing themselves south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maeander</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> known as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caria</ENAMEX>.
        Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> b.c. mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> entered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdark age‚Äù</ENAMEX> of
        limited achievements, but not so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionians</ENAMEX>, who developed an
        outstanding civilization. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX> b.c. the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> main
        city-states of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionia</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ephesus, Priene</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miletus</ENAMEX>, had
        formed what was known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan-Ionic League</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX>, philosophy, and
        the arts flourished, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ionians</ENAMEX> founded further <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lydians</ENAMEX> and Persians
        Inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ionia</ENAMEX> lived the wealthy and powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lydians</ENAMEX>,
        with their capital at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sardis</ENAMEX>. They reached their peak during the reign
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Croesus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">560‚Äì546 b.c.</ENAMEX> ), who owed his fortune to gold panned from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Pactolus</ENAMEX>. His lasting legacy was the invention of coinage,
        which led to the beginnings of our money-based economy. His
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expansionism</ENAMEX> brought the bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionia</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lydian</ENAMEX> rule, but also
        resulted in conflict with the advancing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> in the east, where he
        was roundly defeated. Driven back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sardis</ENAMEX>, he witnessed the sacking
        of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyrus the Great</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">546 b.c.</TIMEX>
        With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia</ENAMEX> defeated, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> lay open to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX>, who swiftly incorporated them into their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. Ionia‚Äôs
        revolt around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">499 b.c.</TIMEX> , supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, was easily subdued.
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Athenian</ENAMEX> involvement provoked the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darius</ENAMEX> to
        invade the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> mainland. He was defeated at the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marathon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">490 b.c.</TIMEX> , and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years later</TIMEX> his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xerxes</ENAMEX> lost the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Salamis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerxes</ENAMEX> suffered a further
        humiliating defeat in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">479 b.c.</TIMEX> , when his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> was beaten at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plataea</ENAMEX> on
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same day</TIMEX> that his fleet lost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycale</ENAMEX>.
        As a result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> Wars, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX> were encouraged to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delian Confederacy</ENAMEX>, paying tribute
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> in return for protection against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athens</ENAMEX> became
        so attached to this source of easy money that dissent soon grew among
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">member cities</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX> led the confederacy from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> after the
        Peloponnesian <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">413‚Äì‚ÄÇ404 b.c.</ENAMEX> ). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX>, sensing weakness in
        the ranks, launched another offensive, resulting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ae¬≠gean</ENAMEX> coast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> coming under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> control in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">387 b.c.</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX>
        Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macedon</ENAMEX> dreamed of driving out
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> from northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and unifying the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> world.
        His dreams were fulfilled, and even surpassed, by his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>, in a brief but action-filled lifetime of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 33 years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">356‚Äì323</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">b.c.</ENAMEX> ). In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">334 b.c.</TIMEX> , aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 22</TIMEX>, he led his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellespont</ENAMEX> (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dardanelles</ENAMEX>), and paused at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> to make a
        sacrifice at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> and pay homage to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achilles</ENAMEX>,
        before going on to defeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle of Granicus</ENAMEX> and
        liberating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ionian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. After conquering the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> coasts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>, and subduing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, he took
        the great prize of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persepolis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> capital, before advancing
        farther still into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. During his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-year</TIMEX> campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander</ENAMEX>
        established <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, and built the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> the world had
        yet seen.
        After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death, the conquered territory
        was divided among his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>, whose mutual antagonism and
        expansionist ambitions led to weaknesses that exposed western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>
        to the increasing might of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.
        Enter the Romans
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most prosperous city-states of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> coast
        was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pergamum</ENAMEX>, ruled since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">264</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">b.c. by the Attalid dynasty</ENAMEX>. The last of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attalid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attalus III</ENAMEX>, is remembered as something of an

        their efficacy on his reluctant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX>. When he died (of natural
        causes) in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">133 b.c.</TIMEX> , his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were dismayed to learn that he had
        bequeathed his entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>. Thus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pergamum</ENAMEX> became the
        capital of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mithridates VI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">King of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontus</ENAMEX> (on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Sea</ENAMEX>), resisted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> occupation, temporarily
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occupied Pergamum</ENAMEX>, and ordered the massacre of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romans</ENAMEX>. But
        eventually <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs power prevailed in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Octavian</ENAMEX> took the name
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Augustus; Rome</ENAMEX> ceased to be a republic, and became an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. There
        followed a long period of peace and prosperity known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pax Romana</ENAMEX>.
        All of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> name for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>) was incorporated in¬≠to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ro¬≠man Empire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> were embellished with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
        Soon, news of a new religion that was beginning to cause
        trouble for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> spread through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christianity</ENAMEX> threatened the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishment</ENAMEX> because it rejected the old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods</ENAMEX> and denied the divinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul the Apostle</ENAMEX> carried
        the word. His voyages (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 40‚Äì56</ENAMEX>) led to the founding of many

        that earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> had built a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the eastern shore of the
        Bosphorus, he decided they must have been blind themselves to overlook
        the advantages of an easily defensible point across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and
        founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantium</ENAMEX> there, on the site now occupied by Topkapƒ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX>.
        In the succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> Byzantium, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>, fell under the sway of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sparta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Persia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. It tried to regain its independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, but proved too
        small and weak, and was conquered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Septimius Severus</ENAMEX> in a.d.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">196</NUMEX>. He had the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> razed to the ground, but soon saw the advantages
        of its strategic location, and began a programme of enlarging and
        strengthening the old defensive walls.
        A succession of weak and decadent emperors saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empire</ENAMEX> fall gradually into decline and anarchy. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">a.d. 286</ENAMEX> Diocletian
        sought to reverse the decline by splitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empire</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">two‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhe</ENAMEX> would govern the east, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicodemia</ENAMEX>, while his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend Maximian</ENAMEX> ruled the west from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milan‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> later to split it
        further into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> parts. His policy succeeded for a time, but following
        his abdication in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 305</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> continued to weaken, harassed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invaders</ENAMEX> and troubled by internal strife. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine the Great</ENAMEX> (who
        was a convert to Christianity) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Licinius</ENAMEX> ruled east and west
        respectively, until in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">324</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine</ENAMEX> overthrew his pagan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> and
        reunited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. He chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byzantium</ENAMEX> as his new capital to emphasize
        the break with heathen <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was inaugurated with great
        ceremony in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">330</TIMEX> and, in honour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, was renamed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Con¬≠stantine</ENAMEX> added new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> walls, following a plan he
        claimed to have been given by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> in a vision, and commissioned a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grand</ENAMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> decorated with a triumphal column as well as
        several other monuments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúNew Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äù soon achieved a preeminence in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> world that it would retain for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years</TIMEX>.
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">392</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodosius</ENAMEX> proclaimed Christianity to be
        the official religion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, and on his death in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">395</NUMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empire</ENAMEX> was split once more, between his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>, and was never again
        to be reunited. The Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, ruled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, fell to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ostrogoths</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">476</TIMEX>, while its neighbour, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">By¬</ENAMEX>≠zantine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, became one of the longest-lived empires the world has ever
        known, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">395 to 1453</TIMEX>.
        The greatest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> emperors was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justinian</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">527 to 565</TIMEX>), who introduced an equitable legal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>, and also extended the boundaries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. He greatly encouraged the arts, and commissioned the
        building of the magnificent basilica, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>.
        Following the death of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prophet Mohammed</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">632</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">armies</ENAMEX>, united under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>, poured out of their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>, and soon took
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantines; Constantinople</ENAMEX> was
        besieged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">674 to 678</TIMEX>, but survived because of its defences. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empire</ENAMEX> was further diminished by the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>,
        and was brought to the brink of civil war by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iconoclastic Crisis</ENAMEX>,
        before enjoying another brief golden age under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">976‚Äì1025</ENAMEX>). But
        the empire‚Äôs troubles increased as invaders made further incursions
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> territory. Most worrying were the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Seljuk Turks</ENAMEX>, who came
        out of the east in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> to wrest large parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX>
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Constantinople‚Äôs</ENAMEX> control. Converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>,
        and fired by religious zeal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seljuks</ENAMEX> overran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>, menacing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> and attacking the pilgrims bound for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reluctantly</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexius</ENAMEX> I sought outside help from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian West</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">First Crusade</ENAMEX> was organized to help the
        Byzantines recapture the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">‚Äúinfidel‚Äù Muslims</ENAMEX>, and
        resulted in victory for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX>. The Second and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Third Crusades</ENAMEX>,
        however, were a disaster for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fourth Crusade</ENAMEX>,
        launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1202</TIMEX> and partly inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> jealousy of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantium‚Äôs</ENAMEX> trading power, became an excuse to plunder Constantinople
        itself. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that had held out against so many attacks by the
        infidel, became subjected to mindless pillaging by fellow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christians</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> ruled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1204 to 1261</TIMEX>, calling
        their new state <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romania</ENAMEX>, also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin Empire</ENAMEX>. A remnant of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> survived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaea</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iznik</ENAMEX>), and recaptured
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1261</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> had been shattered and its great
        monuments were strip¬≠ped of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, and precious works of art.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> was never the same again.
        The Ottomans
        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX> rallied under
        the banner of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osman Gazi</ENAMEX>, who had won a great victory over the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantines</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1301</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osman Gazi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orhan</ENAMEX>, captured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bursa</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1326</TIMEX>,
        and set up his capital there, then moved it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adrianople</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edirne</ENAMEX>),
        which he took in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1361</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX> and
        Thrace, except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX>, was under the control of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osmanli</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> at the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1391‚Äì1425</ENAMEX>), tried to appease his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> by allowing a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        district, mos¬≠que, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribunal</ENAMEX> within his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and by courting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> goodwill with gifts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, but to no avail. The young <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet II</ENAMEX>, who reign¬≠ed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1451 to 1481</TIMEX>, set about cutting
        off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantinople‚</ENAMEX>Äôs supply lines. The huge fortress of Rumeli Hisarƒ±
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just four months</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1452</TIMEX>. He then
        withdrew to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adrian¬</ENAMEX>≠ople to await <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantines</ENAMEX> tried to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> from enemy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> by stretching a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> across its mouth. They repaired and
        strengthened the city walls that had saved them so many times in the
        past, and waited fearfully for the inevitable onslaught. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1453</TIMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sultan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> massed outside the city walls, outnumbering the
        Byzantines <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. The siege and bombardment lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven weeks</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> admiral bypassed the defensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> by having his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>
        dragged overland under cover of darkness, opening a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> attack. The
        final ass ault came on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29 May 1453</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> surged
        through a breach in the walls. The last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine XI</ENAMEX>, fell
        in the fighting, and by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had taken
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of the sought-after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        His <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> act was to ride to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> and order that
        it be converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>; on the following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, he attended the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> prayers in what came to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayasofya Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>). After allowing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> of pillaging,
        he restored order, acting with considerable leniency and good sense.
        Henceforth he became known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúFatih‚Äù</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conqueror</ENAMEX>), and his newly won
        capital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fatih</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet</ENAMEX> laid claim to all the territories
        previously held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantines</ENAMEX>, so that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> incorporated most
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>. Expansion continued
        under his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">succes¬≠¬≠sors</ENAMEX>, but it was during the reign of his great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">grandson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√ºleyman</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> reached its greatest and
        most celebrated heights. S√ºleyman the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnificent</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 25</TIMEX>, ascended
        the throne and ruled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46 years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1520‚Äì1566</ENAMEX>), the longest and most
        glorious reign in the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX>. S√ºleyman‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> captured
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1521</TIMEX>. Rhodes capitulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1523</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six years later</TIMEX> he
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">besieged Vienna</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 days</TIMEX> (unsuccessfully) before going on to take
        most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corsairs</ENAMEX>, notably the infamous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barbarossa</ENAMEX>,
        helped to conquer <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tunis</ENAMEX>.
        By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-17th century</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> had reached its
        greatest extent, stretching from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Batumi</ENAMEX> at the eastern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>, taking in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, the shores of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medina</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moldavia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> coast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crimea</ENAMEX>, and southern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX>. With such far-flung territories, dissolution was inevitable,
        and began immediately. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nor¬≠¬≠thern</ENAMEX> conquests, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>, had
        been lost by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the close of the 17th century</TIMEX>. The decline of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">territories</ENAMEX> was drawn out and painful, leav¬≠ing problems in its wake
        that have been the source of trouble and friction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> ever since.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Decline and Fall</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The year 1821</TIMEX> marked the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Greek War</ENAMEX> of
        Independence, which resulted in victory for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1832</TIMEX>, and
        another loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> had shrunk
        significantly. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A century</TIMEX> of decadence and intermittent wars had left
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> sultanate in serious, irreversible decline. Attempts at
        reform came too late; by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1876</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was bankrupt. Sul¬≠¬≠tan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd√ºl Hamid II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1876‚Äì1909</ENAMEX>) tried to apply absolute rule to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>
        staggering under a crushing foreign debt, with a fragmented population
        of hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and succeeded only in creating ill will and
        dissatisfaction amongst the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of educated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>.
        Young army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and the professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> were
        becoming increasingly interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West¬</ENAMEX>≠ern ways of government and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> literature was widely studied. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gal¬≠a¬≠tasaray Lyc√©e</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        Aca¬≠demy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, were turning out young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> imbued with dreams of
        democracy. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> form¬≠ed an underground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> known as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">‚ÄúYoung Turks</ENAMEX>,‚Äù centred on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salonica</ENAMEX>, where revolt broke out. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd√ºl Hamid</ENAMEX> was deposed and replaced by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet V.</ENAMEX>
        There followed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkan</ENAMEX> Wars, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> lost
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">western Thrace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, into which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>
        entered on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs side. In the notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gallipoli</ENAMEX> campaign of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mustafa Kemal</ENAMEX>, defeated the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dardanelles</ENAMEX>.
        At the end of the war, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty of S√</ENAMEX>®vres formally ended
        the existence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> was given large
        concessions, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armenia</ENAMEX> was to become an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the east,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> was to be divided among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who had
        fought with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> (under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French ‚Äúspheres</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">influence‚Äù</ENAMEX>).
        The subsequent period of internal strife between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenians</ENAMEX> was dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mustafa Kemal</ENAMEX>, who had
        risen from the status of war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> to become the lead¬≠¬≠er of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        nationalist movement. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1920</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> support, he was elected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand National Assembly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ankara</ENAMEX> in defiance of the
        Sultan‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Constantinople</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1919 to 1922</TIMEX> he waged war
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX>, who had invaded at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smyrna</ENAMEX>, and ultimately managed to
        defeat them and force their withdrawal from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX>.
        He was then faced with the delicate task of abolishing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sultanate</ENAMEX> without antagonizing the religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> within his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.
        This meant deposing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet VI</ENAMEX>, who as caliph (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> stood for the old tradition of combined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">secular</ENAMEX> and religious power. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kemal</ENAMEX> handled the problem with his usual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vigour</ENAMEX> and eloquence in a speech to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX>, by linking the power
        of the caliphate with that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assembly</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äú‚Ä</ENAMEX>¶ It was by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sons of Osman</ENAMEX> seized the sovereignty and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultanate</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        nation‚Ä¶ Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> has rebelled and has put a stop to these
        usurpers, and has effectively taken sovereignty and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sultanate</ENAMEX> into
        its own hands. This is an accomplished fact. ‚Äù
        In the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 November 1922</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mehmet VI</ENAMEX> slipped
        quietly away to a waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> warship, to end his life in exile. He
        was replaced as caliph by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>, whose powers were strictly
        limited by secular laws, until that position, too, was abolished in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic of Turkey</ENAMEX>
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lausanne</ENAMEX> defined the present borders
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>. An exchange between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> of
        expatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> resulted in the movement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
        and the wholesale desertion of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1925 to 1935</TIMEX> several wide-ranging reforms were
        introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ke¬≠mal</ENAMEX>. He secularized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, reformed
        the calendar, adapted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> alphabet for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> language,
        emancipated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and improved agriculture and industry. He introduced
        the Western idea of surnames (until then <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> had a single name) and
        made everyone choose a family name, which they had to hand down to
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. For himself he chose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atat√ºrk</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>.
        His proved an appropriate choice, as he almost
        single-handedly created the mod¬≠ern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. He was enormously
        popular with the common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and when he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1938</TIMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mourners</ENAMEX> lined the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway track</ENAMEX> to salute the white
        presidential train as it carried him from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ankara</ENAMEX>, the new capital.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> remained neutral during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>,
        when it entered the war on the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX>. It joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1952</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Party</ENAMEX> was elected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, and remained in control
        until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, when, faced with increasing social and economic
        difficulties, it was overthrown by a military coup. A new constitution
        consolidating liberal reforms was drawn up, and approved by a
        referendum held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>. However, further unrest led to more coups in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971 and 1980</TIMEX>, after which yet another, more restrictive, constitution
        was prepared.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turgut √ñzal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the Motherland <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party</ENAMEX> and former
        world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">banker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>, was elected as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, and
        served until his death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. Under his leadership <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> adopted a
        Western-style economy and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> applied for membership of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX>).
        He was succeeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tan¬≠¬≠su √áiller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turkey‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first woman
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>. She inherited the country‚Äôs rampant inflation and the conflict
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurdish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">separatists</ENAMEX> and the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in the southeast.
        These political and economic difficulties helped the fundamentalist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> later win the largest share of the vote in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. The Refah
        party was officially outlawed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, though it continues to be widely
        supported. Despite these political tensions, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> is becoming an
        increasingly popular tourist destination, offering all the trappings of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean paradise</ENAMEX> and a wealth of fascinating history.
