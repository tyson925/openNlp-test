        Though prehistoric remains from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paleolithic, Neolithic</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronze Ages</ENAMEX> have been unearthed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manzanares Valley</ENAMEX>, prior to
        Madrid‚Äôs sudden elevation to capital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1561</TIMEX> its history was
        rather undistinguished.
        Over a period of many centuries crucial in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> history,
        Madrid‚Äôs significance was negligible. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> built their most
        advanced outpost on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> peninsula, but left nothing of
        consequence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. Armies of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nomads</ENAMEX>, intent on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disseminating Islam</ENAMEX>, invaded the peninsula in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 711</TIMEX>. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, they had overrun most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> played any role in
        these pivotal events, no record of it remains.
        The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the
        Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadarrama</ENAMEX> mountain range,
        appear in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> name for ‚Äúplace of many springs,‚Äù
        variously recorded as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magerit, Mayrit</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magrit</ENAMEX>, eventually evolved
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX> entered historical chronicles for its military
        significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reconquest</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> of struggle, the defending Moorish
        army built a full-scale fort, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°zar</ENAMEX>, on the heights of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>
        commanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manzanares valley</ENAMEX>.
        After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> forces
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfonso VI</ENAMEX> captured <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1083</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alc√°zar</ENAMEX> became a fort of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown of Castile</ENAMEX>. During a counter-offensive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1109</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was
        overrun by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christianized</ENAMEX> fortress held. The Moors
        were expelled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but they remained in control of southern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost four centuries</TIMEX>.
        Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> enjoyed brief prominence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1308</TIMEX> when king
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand IV</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cortes</ENAMEX>, an early version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX>, held a
        formal meeting in the fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. From then on, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>
        began to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, where the air was invigorating and the hunting
        excellent.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> monarchs that united
        all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, first visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1477</TIMEX>. They
        appreciated the town‚Äôs loyalty to the crown, but the idea never
        occurred to anyone, let alone the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> monarchs, that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> might one
        day become the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. Historically important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> seemed secure in
        the role.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs Golden Age</ENAMEX>
        Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> underwent a dramatic
        transformation. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX> the royal pair presided over the final conquest
        over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> and discovery of the New World, including the great
        wealth that feat brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> flourished during a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX>
        Age, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> economic and political supremacy in
        international affairs, accompanied by marvels of art and
        literature.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> were consummate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spaniards</ENAMEX>, committed
        to the expansion of the crown. By contrast, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>, who assumed
        the throne in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1516</TIMEX>, was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flanders</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1500</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> I could
        barely express himself in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habsburgs</ENAMEX>, he
        packed his retinue with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burgundian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nobles</ENAMEX>.
        Soon after his arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> inherited
        the title of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V.</ENAMEX> The responsibilities of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> kept him busy away from the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>,
        Segovia, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valladolid</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. While the monarch was away on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
        his many business trips, his increasingly dissatisfied subjects
        protested violently. A revolt of the comuneros, or townsmen, broke out
        in a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> occupied
        the alc√°zar, which had by then been converted to a royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insurrection</ENAMEX> was quashed and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> executed, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> got the
        message. He tried thereafter to pay more attention to his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Madrid‚Äôs Rise to Capital</ENAMEX>
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1556</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> abdicated in favor of his son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX>,
        good news for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and even better for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe</ENAMEX> moved the royal
        court from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1561</TIMEX>, converting an unimpressive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
        less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the world‚Äôs greatest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">empire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> soared onward and upward, increasing nearly eightfold in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population; Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fortunes as a whole were more volatile. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX>
        took credit for a rousing naval victory at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lepanto</ENAMEX>, teaming with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two decades later</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was
        subjected to the humiliating defeat of its <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúinvincible‚Äù armada</ENAMEX>, at the
        hands of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Drake</ENAMEX> and a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        greatest lasting legacy is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Escorial</ENAMEX>, a grandiose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monastery</ENAMEX> in the foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra de Guadarrama</ENAMEX>, northwest of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>.
        Felipe‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe III</ENAMEX>, was unfaithful to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs new
        capital. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> he held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valladolid</ENAMEX>, though
        eventually he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. It was he who ordered the
        construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>, the magnificent main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> that still
        dignifies the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viejo Madrid</ENAMEX>. Other tasteful, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings constructed</ENAMEX> nearby, such as the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> and town
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hall</ENAMEX>, reveal that the capital was at last being taken seriously.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habsburgs</ENAMEX> bowed out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX> with the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
        II. The subsequent war over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> succession resulted in the
        enthronement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bourbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe V. When Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs alc√°zar
        burned down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1734</TIMEX>, with the loss of many art treasures, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe</ENAMEX> seized
        the opportunity to build a new, incredibly lavish royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madrid‚Äôs Palacio Real</ENAMEX> is still used on occasion by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Carlos</ENAMEX> I
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> ceremonies.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madrid</ENAMEX> owes much to the civic-mindedness of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles III</ENAMEX>,
        who ruled from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1759 to 1788</TIMEX>. He paved and lighted the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>,
        installed public fountains, built the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and laid out vast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promenades</ENAMEX> and gardens.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Francisco de Goya</ENAMEX> painted a court portrait of the next
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles IV</ENAMEX>, in which he looked strangely like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX>.
        But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> was considerably less successful politically than his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transatlantic</ENAMEX> contemporary. His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> reign, weak at best, ended in
        all-round disaster: abdication, arrest, and war.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> again became a battleground in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1800s</TIMEX>, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> taking on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Napoleon</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1808</TIMEX> and invested his older, taller,
        and more agreeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jos√© I.</ENAMEX> On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2, 1808</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> rose up against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interloper</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX> (called the
        War of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX>) went on murderously but
        inconclusively for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>. Finally, with the help of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> expelled the occupying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. In truth, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Bo¬</ENAMEX>≠na¬<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">≠par¬≠te meant well‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhe</ENAMEX> built so many
        pla¬≠zas that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ma¬≠dri¬≠le¬≠√±os</ENAMEX> nicknamed him <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Rey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pla¬≠zue¬≠las‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇbut the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> loathed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> imposed from abroad. Jo¬≠s√© I spent 17 years
        of exile in, of all unlikely places, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>.
        Decline and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decadence</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles IV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fernando VII</ENAMEX>, was seated on his
        rightful throne in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1814</TIMEX>. But the war and
        the repercussions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French Revolution</ENAMEX> had helped to create in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> the nucleus of a liberal national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. Power struggles at home
        and rebellion by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> abroad ensued.
        The spirit of liberalism prevalent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> was tardy in
        reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. After many reverses, a democratic constitution was
        finally proclaimed and constitutional monarchy was instituted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1874</TIMEX>.
        By the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> had been whittled to insignificance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX>,
        who linked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th and 20th centuries</TIMEX>, inaugurated the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro</ENAMEX>
        (underground railway) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University City</ENAMEX>. But he was undone by the
        chronic unrest of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Neither constitutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> nor
        dictatorship proved workable, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> went into exile
        following anti-royalist results in municipal elections.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX>, general elections brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> to
        power, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX> escaped in exile. In the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic</ENAMEX>,
        bitter ideological conflicts divided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">factions</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> was also involved. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several years</TIMEX> the pendulum of
        power in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> swung back and forth between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left and Right</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, a large section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Franco</ENAMEX> rose in revolt against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        side were monarchists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX>, and the
        right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falangists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> against him was a collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">republicans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">socialists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communists</ENAMEX>, and anarchists. The
        civil war developed into one of the great causes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>,
        with support for both sides pouring in from outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Often
        unaware of the particular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> origins of the struggle, many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> saw the civil war as a crucial conflict between democracy and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dictatorship</ENAMEX>, or from the other side, as a conflict between law and
        order and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of social revolution and chaos.
        The war was brutal and bloody, and both sides committed
        atrocities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX> ended with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 700,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">combatants</ENAMEX> dead on
        both sides; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another 30,000</NUMEX> were executed or assassinated, including
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and nuns, and perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were killed in air
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">raids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> remained in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hands</ENAMEX> for most of the war, but the
        government was evacuated in the early stages of a nationalist siege
        that lasted until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1939</TIMEX>.
        Even when the war ended, the hardship continued. Despite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitler‚Äôs</ENAMEX> efforts at persuasion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs new caudillo (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strongman</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">General√≠simo Franco</ENAMEX>, managed to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>
        was admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>, opening the gates to an
        overwhelming tourist invasion, which would have profound effects on
        both the economy and national mentality.
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> rapidly emerged from its
        isolation. The coronation of his designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Carlos</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX>, brought the restoration of parliamentary
        democracy and a relaxation of customs and laws. The king‚Äôs commitment
        to democracy brought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> into line with the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>
        and assured it of membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, which was granted
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>. Madrid flourished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</TIMEX>, as characterized by la
        movida, a hip cultural explosion that rejected the repression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> era through acts of hedonism and creative films, music and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theater</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charismatic Felipe Gonz√°lez</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist</ENAMEX>, was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982 to 1986</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
