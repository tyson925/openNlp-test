        WHAT TO DO
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôre</ENAMEX> wandering around the country‚Äôs myriad palazzos
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, ancient ruins, and world-class <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, you may
        occasionally wonder about everyday life for the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>. The
        concept of la dolce vita easily outlived its introduction in the early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Äô60s</ENAMEX>, given today‚Äôs widening prosperity that has sustained and expanded
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italians‚</ENAMEX>Äô enviable propensity for the sweet life.
        Their love for sport is contagious, elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> all too
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seductive</ENAMEX>, and the time-honored theatricality extends from grand opera
        and after-hours <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> to historical carnivals and colorful religious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">processions</ENAMEX>.
        Sports
        It would be an understatement to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sports</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>, at least as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> sports are concerned.
        For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> are less sacred for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass</ENAMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> (soccer) matches. In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a century</TIMEX> of national
        unity and the scalding experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mussolini‚Äôs</ENAMEX> fascism, sports seem
        almost the only activity that can inspire any semblance of patriotic
        fervor in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>.
        Witness the crowd‚Äôs unashamedly chauvinistic partisanship at
        Rome‚Äôs international open tennis championships or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis Cup</ENAMEX>. On a
        day when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> is involved in a major international football match,
        streets all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are deserted‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇuntil the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> come out
        honking for a frenetic victory parade or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> shuffle on foot to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza del Duomo</ENAMEX> for a funereal post-defeat commiseration and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recrimination</ENAMEX>.
        You can observe the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> (soccer) phenomenon, with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tifosi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>) in full cry. In all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, the most celebrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are studded with top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juventus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torino</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.C. and Inter</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiorentina</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genoa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sampdoria</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cycling</ENAMEX> races are still popular‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇespecially the
        round-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Giro d‚</ENAMEX>ÄôItalia in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>. You can watch world championship
        skiing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cortina</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAmpezzo and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val Gardena</ENAMEX>. Bocce, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">bowling</ENAMEX> game
        similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> boules or p√©tanque, is played in small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> wherever
        there‚Äôs a patch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tree-shaded sand</ENAMEX> or gravel and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> close enough at
        hand to serve a glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> or grappa.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor</ENAMEX> racing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> can watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Grand Prix</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> at
        Monza, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>, or at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imola</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bologna</ENAMEX>.
        On the beaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adriatic coast</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sardinia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sicily</ENAMEX>, swimming is a pleasure that requires a few words
        of warning. Conditions of water pollution vary from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX>, but
        observe the general rule of thumb of avoiding a dip in the immediate
        vicinity of major industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port cities</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palermo</ENAMEX>. Look out for red flags warning about dangerous undercurrents,
        and check to see that beaches are patrolled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguards</ENAMEX>. At most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seaside</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venice Lido</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sardinia‚Äôs Costa Smeralda</ENAMEX>,
        expect to pay for umbrellas, deck chairs, and the use of changing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cabins</ENAMEX>.
        For watersports at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, you can often rent
        equipment on the spot for snorkelling and wind-surfing (particularly
        good on the lakes). The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> at scuba diving and have
        skillful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX>. In the very off chance that you come across
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">archaeological</ENAMEX> finds such as ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anchors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>-jars, even
        sculpture, they must be reported to local municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. Some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> also offer water-skiing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> for a fee.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sailing</ENAMEX> is a popular sport around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sardinia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sicily</ENAMEX>, but
        also on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany‚Äôs Argentario</ENAMEX> peninsula (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">107</NUMEX>).
        Offshore fishing is popular all along the coasts, notably
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tunny</TIMEX> (tuna) off western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sicily</ENAMEX>, for swordfish on the east coast,
        and spear-fishing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bordighera</ENAMEX>. For freshwater fishing in the inland
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">lakes</ENAMEX> and rivers, you will need to get a permit from the local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">municipality</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiking</ENAMEX> is the simplest and most exhilarating way of seeing
        the countryside, whether in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolomites</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX>, around the lakes
        and national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, or merely trekking through the rolling hills of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umbria</ENAMEX>. Remember good shoes, light but solid, and some warm
        clothing. You can rent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> for riding throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇTuscany</ENAMEX> and
        Umbria provide especially scenic terrain.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Golf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> can often play on local private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> with
        proof of their home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> membership. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">18-hole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lido‚Äôs Alberoni</ENAMEX>. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX>, try <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rapallo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">San Remo</ENAMEX>, or Garlenda
        (near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alassio</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis</ENAMEX> is less widespread than in other major Western
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, but it is growing in popularity. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> can
        help you find a hard or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>.
        Skiing is first-class in the established <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of Cortina
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d‚ÄôAmpezzo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Courmayeur</ENAMEX>. Other resorts line the peninsula‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northernmost Alpine</ENAMEX> regions.
        Entertainment
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> moved the melodrama of their lives indoors,
        they called it opera. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX> of the high temples of this art is,
        of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan‚Äôs La Scala</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">151</NUMEX>), showcasing the works of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verdi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bellini</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rossini</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puccini</ENAMEX>, and others. The taste for the
        grandiose musical spectacle has spread all across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> world,
        but the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> and divas need a triumph at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Scala</ENAMEX> for true
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consecration</ENAMEX>. Its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from December</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-May</TIMEX>. For good
        tickets you should plan well in advance through your travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, but
        your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> may be able to help with seats made available by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last-minute</TIMEX>
        cancellations.
        The other great opera <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Fenice</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> (which
        is pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚Äôs Teatro Comunale</ENAMEX>, and the great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Teatro San Carlo</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parma, Perugia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palermo</ENAMEX> also have fine regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. These show performances from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late spring</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early summer</TIMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, the unparalleled venue for open-air opera is
        Verona‚Äôs ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Arena</ENAMEX>, a unique location for performances of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aida</ENAMEX> and other extravagant productions. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baths of Caracalla</ENAMEX> still offer the occasional performance‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthough
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infrequently</ENAMEX>, due to the damage inflicted over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>. Check with
        the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for a seasonal update. August‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Puccini Festival</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuscany‚Äôs Torre del Lago</ENAMEX> is held erratically according to funds
        available. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adriatic, Pesaro</ENAMEX> honors its native <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rossini</ENAMEX> from
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-August to late September</TIMEX>.
        Orchestral concerts of symphonic and chamber music, for
        which it is usually easier to get tickets, are held in the opera houses
        outside and sometimes concurrently with the opera season. Performances
        are also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan‚Äôs Conservatorio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Rome‚Äôs Accademia</ENAMEX> Filarmonica
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romana</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spoleto</ENAMEX>,
        Perugia, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravenna, Rimini, Ravello</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stresa</ENAMEX> all hold important music
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">festivals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Gimignano</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lucca</ENAMEX> stage open-air concerts,
        while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amalfi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs are given in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cathedral cloisters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> never have
        to look long or hard for music festivals in most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lovers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neapolitan</ENAMEX> folk music can enjoy a whole week of
        it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early September</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Piedigrotta festival</ENAMEX>.
        A great open-air festival of jazz, pop, and rock music, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estate Romana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> Summer), is held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and gardens of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>.
        Italy‚Äôs most important jazz festival is held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perugia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, and
        there is another in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alassio</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. For information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs

        For those who seek music action in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> seems to have the best selection. There are also many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX>
        attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> at the seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> has plenty of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nightlife‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇyour best bet is to check the local listings or simply ask
        around.
        Naturally enough, a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> requires a good
        knowledge of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the best productions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>, the latter famous for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giorgio Strehler‚Äôs Piccolo Teatro</ENAMEX>,
        followed by those in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most entertaining ways to polish your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Italian</TIMEX> is
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, where almost all foreign films are dubbed into Italian
        (a minor revolution is taking place in the few movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> playing
        original versions). International film festivals are held at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taormina</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
        The inspired centuries-old design sense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> has
        turned their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into a delightful emporium of style and elegance
        for the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>. The luxury goods of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇjewelry</ENAMEX>, clothes, accessories (especially shoes), but also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luggage</ENAMEX> and household goods and items of interior <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">design‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare</ENAMEX> second
        to none in the world. Not inexpensive, but then the bargain here is not
        in the price, it‚Äôs in the tradition of a centuries-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> of
        meticulous workmanship. Souvenirs are also known for their variety and
        their range of prices.
        There is an abundance of souvenirs that make the perfect
        gift, namely gourmet delicacies, but save these purchases for the end
        of your trip, in order to get them home as fresh as possible. Consider
        the choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheeses</ENAMEX>; salamis; Parma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>; Milanese sweet panettone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brioche; Tuscany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>; Siena‚Äôs cakes and famous panforte, a
        spicy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>-and-nut concoction; and the small production <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chianti</ENAMEX> and
        Orvieto <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> that you may not find back home.
        If you‚Äôve fallen in love with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> coffee, why not buy a
        compact version of the espresso machine or packaged roasted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX>?
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> kitchenware is in general beautifully styled with a great sense
        of color and line.
        In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilizations</ENAMEX> have come and gone,
        there‚Äôs a considerable traffic in archaeological antiquities. You can
        be fairly sure any ancient coins or artifacts are fakes.
        For quality goods, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> prefer shopping in small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boutiques</ENAMEX>. Family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> often guarantee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">craftsmanship</ENAMEX> and personalized service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid-market</ENAMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upim</ENAMEX> are increasingly more commonplace, while
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rinascente</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coin</ENAMEX> are the most upscale. The former are useful for
        your extra T-shirts or throwaway beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sandals</ENAMEX>, the latter for nice
        quality private-label fashion and accessories for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
        If you want friendly treatment in the more expensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôre ahead of the game when dressed appropriately. Even the
        warmest-hearted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> can appear aloof towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> that are
        dressed poorly. Credit cards work almost everywhere <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>, but
        cash and travelers‚Äô checks should always be on hand as a fall back.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haggling</ENAMEX> is pretty much a thing of the past. You can get an occasional
        small sconto (discount) for purchases in volume or while paying in
        cash, but the spread of foreign travel has taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeepers</ENAMEX> in the
        most remote provinces the going international price for everything.
        Except among antiques, art, and secondhand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>, where negotiation
        is part of the business, you may get a very cool response if you
        question (however politely) the marked price.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> continue to be renowned for products of their
        traditional crafts: Naples‚Äô costumed hand-crafted figures for its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nativity</ENAMEX> sets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorrento‚</ENAMEX>Äôs intarsia (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inlaid wood</ENAMEX> for furniture, frames
        or music boxes), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volterra‚</ENAMEX>Äôs alabaster, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gubbio‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        leathergoods, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venice‚</ENAMEX>Äôs glassware. For the rest, the widest range of
        Made-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> products will be found in the large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> where tourism
        promises a brisk business.

        The capital‚Äôs smartest and most expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> (even
        if you‚Äôre not buying, they‚Äôre worth window-shopping just for the superb
        displays) are conveniently concentrated in a compact pedestrian area
        around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Condotti</ENAMEX> at the foot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> Steps. Here you‚Äôll find
        the finest leather goods and of-the-moment fashions from all the
        predictable high-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valentino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Versace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gucci</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missoni</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX> ). A number of classic men‚Äôs clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">meccas</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cucci</ENAMEX> (with a
        C), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brioni</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battistoni</ENAMEX> are still going strong.
        For sheer exclusivity in jewelry, there‚Äôs nothing like the
        imposing marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulgari</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Condotti</ENAMEX>), the ultimate monument
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> luxury.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> dominate the market in art and antiques, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Margutta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via del Babuino</ENAMEX> and other off-shoots of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza di</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spagna</ENAMEX> (as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Giulia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Coronari</ENAMEX>).
        On the outskirts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high-class</ENAMEX> shopping district of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza di Spagna</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find mass-produced sweaters, jeans, and other
        casual wear. Also available are more moderately priced leather goods,
        on the bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Tritone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Nazionale</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via del Corso</ENAMEX>.
        If you‚Äôre looking for second-hand bric-√†-brac, try shops
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campo</ENAMEX> de‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiori</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Navona</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> flea
        market at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porta Portese</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trastevere</ENAMEX> is as much fun for the people
        watching as for the occasional bargains. In any flea market, keep your
        own valuables <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">safe‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpickpockets</ENAMEX> are not uncommon.
        Shopping in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>
        If it has ceded to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> its place as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fashion
        capital, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is still a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of exquisite, if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">classic</ENAMEX>, elegance. The thoroughfares for the smarter fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>,
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, are Via de‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tornabuoni</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via della Vigna Nuova</ENAMEX> and
        Via de‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calzaiuoli</ENAMEX>.
        Florentine leather goods remain unequalled. The country‚Äôs,
        indeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Europe‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> once clustered in small leather
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workshops</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Lorenzo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Croce</ENAMEX>, but goods now come mostly
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> in the periphery. The leather school tucked away behind
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Croce‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sacristy (in what was once <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX>
        monk‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>) is still around, allowing you a glimpse at the
        traditional making of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather goods</ENAMEX> such as handbags, wallets, gloves,
        belts, and desk accessories.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponte Vecchio</ENAMEX> is the most picturesque place to shop for
        pricey but gorgeous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and silver jewelry, designed with centuries of
        learned expertise. Less exclusive jewelry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> abound around
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>.
        Inlaid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> or semi-precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> (intarsia) is a
        venerated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> here, perfected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. Using similar
        techniques, furniture is likely to be expensive, but framed pictures of
        Tuscan landscapes or views of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> are more moderately priced and,
        as souvenirs go, tastefully done. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> also specializes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bookbinding</ENAMEX> and beautiful stationery and paper products.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antique</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are centered mainly around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borgo Ognissanti</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Via della Vigna Nuova</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via delle Fosse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Borgo San Jacopo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maggio</ENAMEX>. Even if you cannot afford the often prohibitive prices, they‚Äôre
        worth visiting as veritable little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>
        sculpture and furniture. If the creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">geniuses</ENAMEX> are long dead, master
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">craftsmen</ENAMEX> continue the tradition of superb reproductions at negotiable
        prices.
        Shopping in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the great adventures here is separating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">treasure</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> from the tourist trap, distinguishing priceless gems
        from pricey junk. By and large, the better although more expensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>. The shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of Mercerie
        has good quality <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> growing progressively moderate in price as
        they approach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rialto</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>; so does the area
        west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>. For cheaper purchases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strada Nuova</ENAMEX> leading behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ca‚</ENAMEX>Äô d‚ÄôOro to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>.
        Everything in between is game.
        The bargains or at least more authentic and tasteful
        products are to be found far from these main tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, in
        artisans‚Äô workshops on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giudecca</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorsoduro</ENAMEX> behind the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zattere‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇto</ENAMEX> be hunted down or stumbled upon by chance.
        Historical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that stand out among the jewelry
        and glass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> can be found in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>. For a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-section of Venetian</ENAMEX> craftsmanship in more moderately priced
        jewelry, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass mosaics</ENAMEX>, take a look at
        Veneziartigiana, just off <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Marco</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calle Larga</ENAMEX>, or in the artisanal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frezzeria</ENAMEX>.
        The famous Venetian glasswar e poses a problem of quality
        and price. Some of the stuff is depressingly ugly, but there is also an
        admirable renewal in both classic and modern design. Just hunt
        carefully. Necklaces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX> or colored beads are popular for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, the antique glass beads collectibles for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Prices in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Murano</ENAMEX> island <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> are rarely better than ‚Äúdowntown,‚Äù but for
        those interested, you do get a free demonstration and transportation
        thrown in. When choosing gifts to be shipped, remember to bypass the
        extremely fragile items and always ask for handling and insurance rates
        before you buy, as they can frequently double the price.
        Visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burano</ENAMEX> to see intricate laceware being made in the
        time-honored manner in the island‚Äôs small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The real thing is
        exquisite but exhorbitantly priced, with a lot of lesser-quality,
        machine-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX> being passed off as locally
        hand-made. Modern reproductions and interpretations of traditional
        patterns can be bought on and around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>, along with
        beautifully embroidered tablecloths and napkins.
        The venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> of exquisite handmade paper goods,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stationery</ENAMEX>, and bookbinding is easy to find. You can give your
        fancy-dress balls back home a touch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> with the finely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">crafted papier-m√¢ch√</ENAMEX>© masks produced by countless workshops for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venice‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wintertime Carnival</ENAMEX>.
        The range of fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Marco</ENAMEX> is small
        but select, with an emphasis on top-class shoes and other leather goods
        made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brenta</ENAMEX> area outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>.
        Shopping in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>
        With the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> has
        also taken over as the fashion capital. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find all the great

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleone</ENAMEX> and its off-shoots. Here, too, are the leading jewelry and

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Duomo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Galleria</ENAMEX> Vittorio
