        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
        Istanbul‚Äôs markets and bazaars offer some of the world‚Äôs
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">interesting‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand challenging‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇopportunities</ENAMEX> for shopping. A huge
        variety of hand-made goods finds its way into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, much of it of very high quality‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwool</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">silk</ENAMEX> carpets, kilims (flat-weave rugs), cicims (embroidered kilims),
        leather goods, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> and pottery, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> and brassware, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jewellery</ENAMEX>. There is also, of course, a lot of poorer-quality
        merchandise aimed specifically at the tourist market, notably in the
        big coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> shopping area in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX> is, undoubtedly, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Bazaar</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> crammed beneath its roof.
        Running downhill from here is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Uzun√ßar¬´ƒ± Caddesi</ENAMEX>, lined with hardware
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, which leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spice Ba¬≠zaar</ENAMEX>, the best place to buy lokum
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delight</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">weekend flea</ENAMEX>-market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beyazƒ±t Square</ENAMEX> is an
        interesting place to browse, and there are bargains to be found among
        the bric-a-brac. Across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> are the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laleli</ENAMEX>,
        the place to look for low-priced clothes. For more modern, upmarket
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shopping</ENAMEX>, you can join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-set in the stylish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ni¬´anta¬´ƒ±</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Te¬´vikiye</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taksim Square</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> west to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galleria</ENAMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">marina</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atak√∂y</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, take a stroll around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ortak√∂y</ENAMEX> on a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Shops</ENAMEX> are generally open <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 9:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, and closed over lunch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.</TIMEX> , though many
        tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> stay open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Bazaar</ENAMEX> is open
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.</TIMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>.
        Bargaining
        In an economy where many products are hand-made, each item
        has a different value depending on the quality of workmanship it shows.
        Bargaining is thus a way of determining an appropriate price, not
        simply a way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeeper</ENAMEX> to get more money from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX>. To
        get the best price, though, you must get to know the market by browsing
        in several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and asking the prices of comparable pieces.
        When you find something you want to buy, ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopkeeper</ENAMEX>
        how much it costs, and then offer around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of what you‚Äôre prepared
        to pay. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> will feign amazement at such an insultingly low
        price, and discourse at length on the quality of the work, but will
        eventually suggest a lower price. You, of course, will plead poverty
        and suggest that you can buy the same thing more cheaply elsewhere, but
        end up making an offer slightly higher than your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. Ideally, you
        should have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> who acts impatient and tries to get you to leave.
        This good-natured banter will continue back and forth until you settle
        on a mutually acceptable price. For expensive items, say a carpet or a
        leather jacket, the process might be lengthy and involve several
        glasses of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour</TIMEX> of your time. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> golden rules:
        never begin bargaining for something you do not really intend to buy,
        and never quote a price that you aren‚Äôt prepared to pay.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> on the coast, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> are aware that
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> feel uncomfortable with bargaining, and will give you
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbest price‚Äù</ENAMEX> straight away if you ask them to. This is the
        minimum they are prepared to accept, and you will probably be wasting
        your time if you try to force them any lower. The competition be¬≠tween
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> is fierce, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> work on very narrow profit
        margins.
        What to Buy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiques</ENAMEX>. In a place steeped in history, buying antiques
        seems the logical thing to do. But remember, it is illegal to take
        genuine antiques out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> without an export licence. If you
        want to buy any object that might be considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> piece, you
        will have to obtain a certificate from the directorate of a local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> that clears it for export. Despite this there are many
        interesting and attractive fake ‚Äúantiques‚Äù for sale in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX>,
        including swords and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">daggers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>-making sets, and copper
        and brass tray tables with wooden stands. But even if your purchase
        only looks ‚Äúantique,‚Äù it may still arouse suspicion at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>. Make
        sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> gives you a fatura (invoice) stating the value of the
        piece, and when and where it was made.
        Carpets and kilims. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> carpets are, of course, world
        famous for their beauty and durability, and are top of the shopping
        list for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Kilims are small rugs that are woven rather
        than knotted, and have no pile; a cicim is a kilim with embroidered
        decoration. All originated as floor and wall coverings for nomad
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dwellings‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcarpets</ENAMEX> as hard-wearing, insulated floor coverings, and
        kilims as covers and wall hangings. No <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hand-made carpets are
        identical. The traditional patterns and symbols are handed down from
        generation to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> and have great significance to the weaver,
        conferring good luck on the household, protection against the ‚Äúevil
        eye,‚Äù or expressing the desire for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>. Ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> to explain
        the symbols on any carpet you are thinking of buying.
        The price of a carpet is affected by its age, rarity,
        quality of materials and dyes, and tightness of weave. The number of
        knots per square centimetre ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20‚ÄÇ‚Äì30</NUMEX> for a coarse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> carpet
        to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100‚ÄÇ‚Äì200</NUMEX> for the most expensive silk carpets, which can cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of pounds. Natural dyes look better and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last longer than</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthetics</ENAMEX>, but are more expensive. You can tell the difference by
        wetting a corner of a white handkerchief and rubbing the carpet.
        Synthetic dyes will stain the white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>, while the smell of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> means that the carpet has been bleached to make it look older.
        Even if you are not an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX>, asking a few pertinent questions will
        make the carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> less likely to fob you off with an inferior
        item. Again, it is well worth doing your homework and shopping around a
        bit before deciding on which carpet to buy.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX> and pottery. The best ceramic tiles ever produced
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> came from the kilns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iznik</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bursa</ENAMEX>, but these are now
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collector‚Äôs</ENAMEX> items. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> you will have to settle for polychrome tiles,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bowls</ENAMEX>, plates, and vases made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">K√ºtahya</ENAMEX>, which often copy the Iznik
        designs but serve as affordable souvenirs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Copper</ENAMEX> and brassware. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shining</ENAMEX>, hand-beaten objects in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> can be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Bedesten</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Bazaar</ENAMEX>, and also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bakƒ±rcƒ±lar Caddesi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Copp¬</ENAMEX>≠ersmiths‚Äô
        Street) behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beyazƒ±t Square</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braziers</ENAMEX> and shoeshine boxes, lamps,
        candlesticks, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>-grinders, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>-pots, and samovars are am¬≠ong the
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> available. The coppersmith will also be happy to make
        items to order, or to engrave your purchase. If you plan to use a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper item</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boiling water</ENAMEX> or cooking, make sure that it is tinned
        on the inside, as unlined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> can be slightly toxic.
        Leather and suede. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul‚Äôs Grand Bazaar</ENAMEX> has many leather
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> offering a huge selection of handbags, belts, purses, wallets,
        jackets, trousers, and skirts. Prices and quality vary widely, but are
        generally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a half</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of what you would pay back home.
        While the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX> is generally of good quality, some of the goods on
        offer in the popular tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> suffer from poor stitching, so
        check the standard of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmanship</ENAMEX> carefully before buying. If you
        prefer you can have clothes and shoes made to order at many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, but
        good-quality work will take time.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewellery</ENAMEX>. The best place to shop for quality jewellery is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Bedesten</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Bazaar</ENAMEX>; cheaper items can be found in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> along nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kalpakcƒ±lar Ba¬´ƒ± Caddesi</ENAMEX> (the bazaar‚Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> is sold by weight, with a surcharge for workmanship (gold prices
        are posted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> in the bazaar); genuine sterling silver should carry a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hallmark</ENAMEX>. There are many cheap imitations on the market, with fake
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> and silver plating, so beware of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">rip-offs</ENAMEX>, especially in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
        Other items you might consider include nargiles, the famous
        ‚Äúhubble-bubble‚Äù pipes popular with old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">caf√©s</ENAMEX>; meerschaum
        pipes and figurines, produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eski¬´ehir</ENAMEX>; luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> towels,
        the best of which come from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bursa</ENAMEX>; colourful Karag√∂z puppets, made from
        dyed camel-hide; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> prayerbeads (tespih); traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        musical instruments, such as the mandolin-like saz, the davul (drum),
        or the ney, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dervish</ENAMEX> flute; and lokum, better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delight</ENAMEX>, which comes in many flavours and can be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in and
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spice Bazaar</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku¬´adasƒ±</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bodrum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marmaris</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sponges</ENAMEX> in all shapes and sizes, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodrum‚</ENAMEX>Äôs hand-crafted leather
        sandals are not only chic and cool, but practical, too.
        Entertainment
        Nightlife
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>-style supper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> called gazinos offer an
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> of folk music and belly-dancing, usually with dinner and drinks
        included. Most organized tours generally include a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> at a gazino as
        part of the package; otherwise you can book a table through your hotel
        or through a travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taksim</ENAMEX> and on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> shore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>; one of the best-known is at the top of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Tower</ENAMEX>.
        Western-style bars, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX> can be found in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taksim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, but be warned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> in the side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
        off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Istiklal Caddesi</ENAMEX> are mostly rip-off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> where you will be
        charged an enormous bill for a round of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>, and forcibly relieved
        of your wallet if you refuse to pay up. There are also good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atak√∂y</ENAMEX> (southwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>), and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ortak√∂y</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebek</ENAMEX> on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Music and Cinema</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Atat√ºrk Cultural Centre</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taksim Square</ENAMEX> offers a
        programme of opera, ballet, and symphony concerts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>;
        during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Istanbul International Festival</ENAMEX>, held from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-June</TIMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid-July</ENAMEX>), the city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts musicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">performers</ENAMEX> from all over the
        world. Jazz is popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX>, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> have live
        bands performing over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>.
        There are many cinemas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istiklal Caddesi</ENAMEX>, and a
        multi-screen theatre at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">√áemberlita¬</NUMEX>´ in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old City</ENAMEX>, which show
        mainstream movies. Look for the word orijinal on the poster‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthis
        means that the film will be shown in its original language, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subtitles</ENAMEX>; otherwise it has been dubbed.
        Sound and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Light Show</ENAMEX>
        From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> you can enjoy a free sound-and-light
        show at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Mosque</ENAMEX> (the viewing benches are about halfway between
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>). The show, which begins <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> at
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00 p.m.</TIMEX> , relates in melodramatic fashion the history of Istanbul
        while coloured floodlights illuminate the spectacular architecture of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Mosque</ENAMEX>. The commentary is in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>, in rotation‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcheck the notice by the benches for the date of
        the next performance in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baths</ENAMEX>
        No trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> would be complete without a visit to the
        hamam, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> bath. There are a couple of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> in
        Istanbul which cater specifically for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, namely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">√áa‚Äòalo‚Äòlu Hamamƒ±</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sultanahmet</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galatasaray Hamamƒ±</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beyo‚Äòlu.</ENAMEX> These <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> are worth a visit for their interior marble
        architecture alone, but the opportunity to experience a genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bath</ENAMEX> should not be missed. There are usually separate entrances for men
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">erkek</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (kadƒ±n), but if there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, then
        different times are set aside for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        Leave your valuables in a locker at the desk and get
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undressed</ENAMEX> in the changing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. Wearing a towel and bath-clogs, you
        will be shown to the steamy marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">washroom</ENAMEX>, where buckets of hot water
        will be poured over you before an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant</ENAMEX> sets to work with a coarse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glove</ENAMEX>, removing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> and dead skin and leaving you pink and glowing.
        You can also have a massage at this point (for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional</NUMEX> fee).
        Afterwards you retire to the changing room for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or a drink, feeling
        completely relaxed and rejuvenated.
        Sports
        Watersports
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean coast</ENAMEX> is a watersports paradise, but pollution
        around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Istanbul</ENAMEX> means that you will have to travel some distance from

        Sarƒ±yer, where a taxi or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dolmu¬´</NUMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX>) will take you the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">71‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) to the coast. There are good swimming beaches on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princes‚Äô Islands</ENAMEX>, too, but they get extremely crowded at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. West
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, there are beaches at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florya</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km/121‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>), and

        All the standard beach sports can be enjoyed at the main
        Aegean <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">resorts‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwindsurfing</ENAMEX>, water-skiing, parasailing, and
        jet-skiing. Equipment hire and instruction are available for those who

        Bitez, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bodrum</ENAMEX>.
        Skiing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uluda‚Äò</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Mountain</ENAMEX>, with a height of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,800 metres/5,400</NUMEX>

        directly to the ski area; alternatively, you can drive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 miles</NUMEX>)
        up a winding mountain road to the hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen or so</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, which are usually booked solid at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>; they can
        hire out equipment if needed. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> has its own ski-tow‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthere is
        no comprehensive ski-pass system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> may not be very
        challenging, but there‚Äôs enough to keep you interested for a few
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>
        Unique to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> is the national sport of oiled wrestling
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ya‚Äòlƒ± g√ºre¬´</ENAMEX>). An <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> gathering is held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kƒ±rk-pƒ±nar</ENAMEX>, near
        Edirne, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">230 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">143 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>,
        wearing only a pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather breeches</ENAMEX>, coat themselves in olive oil
        and perform a ceremonial procession before getting to grips with their
        slippery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> and flinging each other around to the delighted
        cheers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of spectators.
        An even more exotic spectacle is camel wrestling (deve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g√ºre¬´i</ENAMEX>), which can be seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sel√ßuk</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ku¬´adasƒ±</ENAMEX>. These
        hump-backed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> are bad-tempered, and when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moody males</ENAMEX> confront
        each other in the ring a fierce sparring match ensues, in which they
        use their necks to try to throw each other off balance. Before they get
        injured they are separated, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> is decided by a panel of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loser</ENAMEX> is dragged off.
        After that scene, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> racing may seem rather tame by
        comparison. Races are held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between April</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> at the Veliefendi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bakƒ±rk√∂y</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>,
        they move to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izmir</ENAMEX>.
        Eating Out
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> has one of the world‚Äôs richest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cuisines</ENAMEX>, with
        influences derived from the many cultures of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX>,
        and top-quality produce from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs lush farmland and fertile seas.
        Many dishes originated in the kitchens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> sultans‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S√ºleyman the Magnificent</ENAMEX> there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 150</NUMEX> recipes for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aubergines</ENAMEX> alone. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, however, will be exposed to only a
        small range of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> dishes, unless they are invited into a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, or eat at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the country‚Äôs better <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. The majority
        of eating places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> offer the standard
        fare of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, salads, kebabs, and seafood.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meal Times</ENAMEX>
        The typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> breakfast, served <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 7:00</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00 a.m.</TIMEX> , usually consists of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jam</ENAMEX>, with
        olives <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cucumber</ENAMEX>, tomato, white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, and perhaps a hard-boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>,
        washed down with sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">black tea</ENAMEX>. Try asking for menemen, a delicious
        dish of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> scrambled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>, green peppers, and onion.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> eat out regularly, and as a result there
        are many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and food <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls o pen</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> and late
        into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>. There are no set times for lunch and dinner,
        especially in tourist areas, and you can eat at almost any time of
        day.
        A typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> begins with a spread of meze
        (starters), washed down with rakƒ±, followed by grilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, or
        kebabs, and rounded off with fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk puddings</ENAMEX>, and cups of
        the famous strong black <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> coffee.
        When ordering, it is customary to be taken to the kitchen
        to look at the various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dishes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou</ENAMEX> will find printed menus only in
        tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt order a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> until you have finished
        the meze; you may be too full to appreciate it. It is perfectly
        acceptable to have a meal composed entirely of meze.
        Where to Eat
        Many of the eating places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> specialize in serving a
        certain kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>. An average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, offering a variety of
        typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> food and drink, freshly prepared, is called a lokanta
        or restoran, and may or may not be licensed. A gazino is a restaurant
        that serves <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and usually also offers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> floor show of
        belly-dancing and folk music. Hazƒ±r <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">yemek (‚Äúready food‚Äù</ENAMEX>) means that you
        can choose your meal from heated trays of pre-cooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
        A kebap√ßƒ± specializes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grilled meats</ENAMEX>, notably kebabs
        served with pide and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX>, while a pideci or pide salonu is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza parlour</ENAMEX>, dishing up tasty pide (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unleavened bread</ENAMEX>)
        topped with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minced lamb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>. You can enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX> meatballs
        in a k√∂fteci, tripe in an i¬´kembeci, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">√ßorbacƒ±</ENAMEX>, and milk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">puddings</ENAMEX> in a muhallebici. A b√ºfe is a street kiosk which sells <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soft-drinks</ENAMEX>. (See recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on pages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">137‚Äì143</NUMEX>. )
        What to Eat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starters</ENAMEX> (meze)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meze</ENAMEX> is the collective name given to a wide selection of
        appetizers, both hot and cold. They are usually presented on a tray at
        your table, or in a glass-fronted display case, and you can choose as
        few or as many dishes as you like. The more popular offerings include
        kuru fasulye (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haricot beans</ENAMEX> in tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>), patlƒ±can kizartmasƒ±
        (aubergine fried in olive oil and garlic), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬´ak¬´uka</ENAMEX> (aubergine, tomato,
        and hot peppers in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>), cacƒ±k (yoghurt with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cucumber</ENAMEX> and garlic),
        biber dolmasƒ± (green peppers stuffed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, raisins, and pine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuts</ENAMEX>), sigara b√∂re‚Äòƒ± (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>-filled pastry rolls), and a range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salads</ENAMEX>. √áerkez tavu‚Äòu (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Circassian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>) is a classic dish of chicken
        fillet cooked in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> flavoured with ground walnuts and paprika.
        Meze are served with fresh white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> to soak up the oil and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juices</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Soups (√ßorba</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soups</ENAMEX> are usually thick and substantial. Try d√º¬≠‚Äò√ºn
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">√ßorbasƒ± (‚Äúwedding‚Äù soup</ENAMEX>, a mutton <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth flavoured</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon juice</ENAMEX> and

        or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">i¬´kembe √ßorbasƒ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tripe soup</ENAMEX>, believed to be a hangover cure).
        I¬´kembecis stay open until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the early hours of the morning</TIMEX> to serve
        bowls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tripe soup</ENAMEX> to peckish <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-night</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">revellers</ENAMEX> on their way
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
        Main Courses
        Ask anyone to name a typically <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> and the likely
        answer you‚Äôll get is kebap‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe well-known grilled, broiled, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">roasted meat</ENAMEX>. The most common varieties are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">¬´i¬´ kebap</ENAMEX> (cubes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX>
        threaded on a skewer and grilled over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">charcoal</TIMEX>); d√∂ner kebap (literally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúrevolving‚Äù kebap‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa stack</ENAMEX> of marinated, sliced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX> and minced mutton
        roasted on a vertical spit, with slices cut off as the outer layers
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cook</ENAMEX>); Adana kebap (spicy minced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> moulded around a skewer and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grilled</ENAMEX>); and fƒ±rƒ±n kebap (oven-roasted fillet of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb marinated</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yoghurt</ENAMEX>).
        The ubiquitous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iskender</ENAMEX> kebap is a dish of d√∂ner kebap
        served on a bed of diced pide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomato sauce</ENAMEX> and yoghurt,
        topped with a sizzling splash of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">browned butter</ENAMEX>. √áiftlik kebap is a
        casserole of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lamb</ENAMEX>, onion, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX>. Meatballs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minced lamb</ENAMEX>, usually
        served with a tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>, are called k√∂fte. A classic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX>,
        well worth asking for, is mantarlƒ± <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">g√ºve√ß</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious stew</ENAMEX> of tender
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lamb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX>, peppers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>, and garlic baked in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay dish</ENAMEX> and
        topped with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Seafood</ENAMEX>
        The seas around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> abound with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and waterfront
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX> serve up the catch of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, sold by weight. Choose your
        own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the display and find out how much it will cost before
        having it cooked. Some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tastiest species</ENAMEX> are levrek (sea bass),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barbunya</ENAMEX> (red mullet), palamut (bonito), uskumru (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">mackerel</ENAMEX>), and l√ºfer
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">bluefish</NUMEX>). The best way to enjoy your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> is simply to have it
        grilled over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">charcoal</TIMEX>; the waiter will remove the bones if you ask.
        Look out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kƒ±lƒ±√ß ¬´i¬´</ENAMEX>, chunks of juicy swordfish skewered with onion,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pepper</ENAMEX>, and tomato, and grilled.
        Other kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> more commonly appear as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meze‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇkalamar</ENAMEX> (squid), ahtapod (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">octopus</ENAMEX>), karides (prawns), sardalya
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">sardines</NUMEX>), and midye (mussels). The mussels are either coated in flour
        and fried (midye tava), or stuffed with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, pine nuts, raisins, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cinnamon</ENAMEX> (midye dolmasƒ±).
        Desserts
        Fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> is often served to round off a meal‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsucculent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">karpuz</ENAMEX> (watermelon) and kavun (musk melon), kiraz (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherries</ENAMEX>), kayƒ±sƒ±
        (apricot), incir (figs), d√ºt (mulberries), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">erik</ENAMEX> (sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plums)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇbut
        when it comes to prepared desserts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> have a very sweet tooth.
        The most well known is lokum (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delight</ENAMEX>), a soft jelly, flavoured
        with rosewater and sprinkled with icing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. Another classic dessert
        is bak¬≠lava, made of alternating layers of thin pastry and ground
        pistachios, almonds, or walnuts, saturated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">syrup</ENAMEX>. Many other
        sugary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">confections</ENAMEX> have names which betray their origins in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">harem‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdilber duda‚Äòƒ± (‚Äúlips</ENAMEX> of the beloved‚Äù), hanƒ±m <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">g√∂be‚Äòƒ± (‚Äúlady‚</ENAMEX>Äôs

        A traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> (muhallebici) serves
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>-based desserts like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fƒ±rƒ±n s√ºtla√ß</ENAMEX> (baked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice pudding</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zerde</ENAMEX> (a saffron-flavoured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice pudding</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tavuk g√∂‚Äòs√º</ENAMEX> (a
        combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>, and chicken breast). A more unusual
        dish is a¬´ure, a kind of sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porridge</ENAMEX> made with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereals</ENAMEX>, nuts, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fruit</ENAMEX> sprinkled with rose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        Drinks
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">national</ENAMEX> drink is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea (√ßay</ENAMEX>). It is drunk
        throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, oiling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX>, and sealing many a business deal. If you bargain for a carpet
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Bazaar</ENAMEX> you will get through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> glasses of √ßay
        before a price is agreed. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Tea</ENAMEX> is usually served black in small
        tulip-shaped glasses.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> coffee (kahve) is strong, black, and served
        complete with grounds in a small espresso cup, with a glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> on
        the side. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sugar</ENAMEX> is added while brewing, so order sade kahve (no sugar),
        orta kahve (sweet), or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">√ßok ¬´ekerli kahve</ENAMEX> (very sweet). Leave it for a
        moment for the grounds to settle, and remember not to drain your cup.
        If you want instant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, ask for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nescaf√©.</ENAMEX>
