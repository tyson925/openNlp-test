        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHOPPING</ENAMEX>
        If there was ever a shopping heaven, this is it. Everything
        you could possibly wantâ€‚â€”â€‚as well as things you never even knew you
        simply must haveâ€‚â€”â€‚are all at your disposal with a flash of the credit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX>. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> located along charming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, stacked in
        mega-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, and tucked into nondescript neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nooks</ENAMEX>, thereâ€™s no
        doubt youâ€™ll find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a few</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> mementos to carry
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Districts</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rodeo Drive</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> seems to be the first stop on
        every shopperâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circuit</ENAMEX>. Itâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>pricey emporia <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanel, Mondi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giorgio Armani</ENAMEX>, but the more affordable retailers
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guess</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vie</ENAMEX> for tourist dollars as well.
        Less classic and expensive, more funky and youthful attire
        is offered at virtually every doorstep along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Melrose Avenue</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> was once the epicenter of hip <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>
        counterculture, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> has become more of a strolling
        street for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> from around the world. Still, there are
        plenty of bargains to be found. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Melrose Avenue</ENAMEX> carries on into West
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, where, amidst the art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and design <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">showrooms</ENAMEX>, youâ€™ll
        find exorbitantly expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Herman Fred Segal</ENAMEX>, which is the best
        and most celebrity-frequented <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-</ENAMEX>department store in town. Another
        favorite is elite clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxfield</ENAMEX>, which carries a range of top
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Street</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cienega</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crescent Heights</ENAMEX>, is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melrose</ENAMEX> alternative, with a more authentically funky atmosphere,
        along with antiques, clothing, shoe, and gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brea</ENAMEX> (the blocks between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilshire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melrose</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Boulevard</ENAMEX>
        (between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Brea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curson</ENAMEX>) have become destinations for the stylish
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> who are too old for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Melrose</ENAMEX> fashion and too hip for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rodeo</ENAMEX>. Along
        both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> youâ€™ll find retro furnishings, vintage clothing, designer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and fun gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sunset Boulevardâ€™s Sunset Plaza</ENAMEX> is another stretch of hip
        upmarket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>. Along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> not found elsewhere, youâ€™ll
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">encounter Hollywood</ENAMEX> culture at its most flaunting and tawdry.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> also has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than a dozen</NUMEX> specialized book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the most famous are the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bodhi Tree on Melrose</ENAMEX>, which carries
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">metaphysical</ENAMEX> and New Age titles, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book Soup</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sunset Boulevard</ENAMEX>,
        which also carries international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">periodicals</ENAMEX>.
        Since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> wouldnâ€™t think of driving so
        far east to spend their money, this chic seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a comparable
        number of phenomenal shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Very cool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Street</ENAMEX> celebrates
        everything from thrift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> to chic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue</ENAMEX> is known
        for pricy upscale <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> apparel and furnishings. The eternally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crowded Third Street Promenade</ENAMEX> caters to the tourist and the local
        markets with a vast selection of affordable clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, jewelry
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>.
        Over the mountains to the northeast, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Town Pasadena</ENAMEX> is a
        lovely place to stroll and browse the enticing clothing, lingerie, and
        gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. Just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Fernando Valleyâ</ENAMEX>€™s main
        drag, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ventura Boulevard</ENAMEX>, is the place valley-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX> go to buy
        virtually everything, which means the selection along the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several-mile</NUMEX>
        strip is endless.
        Hardly catering to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Cityâ</ENAMEX>€™s CityWalk
        attempts to snag tourist dollars with its extensive collection of
        retail wonders, including magic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, toy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, sports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> of science fiction memorabilia.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping Malls</ENAMEX>
        In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where spending time in traffic is to be avoided
        at all costs, one-stop shopping is essential. Enter the realm of
        shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, where everything youâ€™re looking for is available
        without moving your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> set usually bops over to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Century City Shopping Center</ENAMEX>, a pleasantly designed open-air mall
        thatâ€™s an absolute parking nightmare on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>. Another option,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">bordering West Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200-plus</NUMEX> store
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westwood</ENAMEX> has the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Westside Pavilion</ENAMEX>. To shop by the sea,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Monica Place</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> at the end of the Third Street
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promenade</ENAMEX>.
        On the periphery, thereâ€™s the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valleyâ€™s Sherman Oaks</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galleria</ENAMEX> and nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fashion Square</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> rejoice
        over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Mesaâ€™s South Coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX>, the areaâ€™s classiest and most
        extensive shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, including various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer outlets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> names. Fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Island</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> is
        another good <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange County</ENAMEX> shopping enclave.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department Stores</ENAMEX>
        Department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macyâ€™s</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nordstrom</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdaleâ€™s</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neiman-Marcus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barneyâ€™s New York</ENAMEX>
        (which has valet parking! ) are strategically located around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>,
        often in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> location. Many can be found along <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilshire</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Boulevard</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>.
        Bargains
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooper Building</ENAMEX> forms the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">L.A.â€™s Garment</ENAMEX>
        District, which is located southeast of central Downtown on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
        Street. It features over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> for discounted designer fashions,
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armani</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKNY</ENAMEX>. When you hunt for bargains in the garment
        district, it definitely pays to be a savvy and patient shopper, as some
        of the merchandise could easily have been sitting around in the
        warehouse for some time. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jewelry District</ENAMEX> is also situated on
        nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hill Street</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Fifth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Sixth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County</ENAMEX> and its
        branch in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burbank</ENAMEX> are great for the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. They feature not only
        dinosaurs but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovery Centers</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> can choose from a wealth of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>-oriented activities for all ages. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Science</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">â€ˆCenter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAX</ENAMEX> Theaterfeatures many interactive exhibits as well as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAX</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George C. Page Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Brea Discoveries</ENAMEX> is another
        favorite.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Angeles Zoo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffith Park</ENAMEX> always makes a good
        outing for all age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Several other attractions are nearby, all in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffith Park</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, pony, and stagecoach rides, a carousel,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffith Observatory</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX> has put a great deal of money
        into making the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Monica Pier</ENAMEX> a fun-filled family destination with
        a carousel and other rides, arcade games, and inexpensive carnival
        food.
        If youâ€™re exhausted, thereâ€™s no better way to wear out the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> than a day at the beach. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Monica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Beach</ENAMEX>, and the
        various <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Bay</ENAMEX> beachesâ€‚â€”â€‚as well as those in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange Countyâ€‚â€”â</ENAMEX>€‚have
        paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> for cycling, roller skating, jogging, and walking, with
        equipment rental nearby. Most beaches also have volleyball nets and
        many have childrenâ€™s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX>. (For more information, see pages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>
