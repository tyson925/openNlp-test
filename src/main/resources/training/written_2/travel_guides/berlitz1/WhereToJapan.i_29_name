        To help you plan your itinerary, we divide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        regional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is devoted entirely to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, where you‚Äôre
        likely to begin your trip, get your bearings, and become acquainted
        with modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. We then present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> tours spreading out from the
        capital to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of historic and artistic interest as well as to
        sites of natural beauty. If you have sufficient time to explore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>,
        you might want to begin and end your visit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX>, you
        can venture out to explore the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>
        Originally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">meaning ‚Äúestuary‚Äù</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> was just
        a sleepy little village surrounded by marshland on the broad Kanto
        plain until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 16th century</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokugawa Ieyasu</ENAMEX> moved
        here and made it the center of his vast domains. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ieyasu</ENAMEX> became
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shogun</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1603</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edo</ENAMEX> in turn became the seat of national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">government‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> the largest in the world. Edo expanded
        rapidly to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ieyasu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs 80,000 retainers and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and
        the myriad common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who served their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">daily</ENAMEX> needs. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1787</TIMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> had grown to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,368,000</NUMEX>.
        The ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> lived on the high ground, the Yamanote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(‚Äúbluffs‚Äù</ENAMEX>) west and south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>. The artisans, tradespeople,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">providers</ENAMEX> of entertainment (reputable and not so reputable) lived
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúdowntown‚Äù</ENAMEX> on the reclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">marshlands</ENAMEX> north and east, in the area
        still known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shitamachi</ENAMEX>. As these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations interacted</ENAMEX>, a
        unique new culture was born. Edo became the center of power and also
        the center of all that was vibrant and compelling in the arts.
        After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> grew even stronger, when the movement
        known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiji Restoration</ENAMEX> overthrew the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shogunate and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edo</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo (‚</ENAMEX>ÄúEastern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital‚Äù</ENAMEX>), and from that moment on all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">roads‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpolitical</ENAMEX>, cultural, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">financial‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇled</ENAMEX> here.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> suffered almost total
        destruction. First, the earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX> and subsequent fire razed
        nearly all vestiges of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edo</ENAMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 140,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the
        process. Rebuilt without any comprehensive urban plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> remains a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of subcenters and neighborhoods, even <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, each with its own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinct</ENAMEX> personality.
        Unlike the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, there is no
        prevailing style of architecture here, no ‚Äúmonumental‚Äù core for a new
        building to harmonize or clash with. Even after the collapse of the
        economic bubble in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, construction projects are everywhere. Whole
        blocks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> seem to disappear <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>, replaced in the blink
        of an eye by new office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominiums</ENAMEX>, cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>,
        and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of enormous creative and entrepreneurial
        energy, much of which goes into reinventing itself. If there‚Äôs a
        commodity in short supply here, it‚Äôs relaxation. Nobody ‚Äústrolls‚Äù in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, and there are few places to sit down outdoors and watch the
        world go by. The idea of a long, leisurely <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch hour</TIMEX> is utterly alien.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> are in a hurry to get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">somewhere‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeven</ENAMEX> if they don‚Äôt
        always know precisely where they‚Äôre going.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Palace</ENAMEX>
        If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> can be said to have any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at all, this is it.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Today‚Äôs Imperial Palace</ENAMEX> is on the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shogunate</ENAMEX> ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">265 years</TIMEX>; it was thereafter home to
        the emperors of the modern era. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> was almost totally destroyed
        in the air raids of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, then rebuilt in ferroconcrete. This
        is the least interesting part of what was once the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortifications</ENAMEX> in the world, and in any case you can‚Äôt get in to see
        it. What you can see are the lovely grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Garden</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">moat</ENAMEX> and massive stone ramparts, and those few examples of classic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">architecture‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, armories, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">watchtowers‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthat</ENAMEX> have survived since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>.
        The imperial family still resides in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, so the
        general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> is admitted to the grounds on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two days each year</TIMEX>:
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 January and 23 December</TIMEX>. On these occasions, you might find it
        hard to compete with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who come
        to pay their respects.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Palace‚Äôs East Garden</ENAMEX> is open to the public
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Otemachi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway station</ENAMEX>, you
        enter the gardens at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Otemon Gate</ENAMEX> and wander through hedgerows of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">white</ENAMEX> and pink azaleas, around ponds and little waterfalls edged with
        pines, plum <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, canary <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX>, and soft green cryptomeria japonica.
        Over the treetops you catch an occasional glimpse of the skyscrapers of
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. Also on the grounds are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Imperial</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collections</ENAMEX>, an exhibition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> for art treasures donated to the public
        by the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>; and the ‚ÄúHundred<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">-Man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guardhouse</ENAMEX>,‚Äù where
        the approach to the inner sanctum of the fortress was defended by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        shifts of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> samurai <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> each.
        A walk clockwise around the palace grounds will bring you
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to the picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nijubashi Bridge</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seimon Gate</ENAMEX>, where
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> is allowed to enter the palace grounds. You then pass the
        most prominent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs modern government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, the National
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚Äôs parliament</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. A complete circuit
        would also include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Theater</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Art</ENAMEX>. With a short detour, you can also take in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yasukuni Jinja</ENAMEX>.
        Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX>, this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúShrine of Peace for the Nation</ENAMEX>,‚Äù
        dedicated to the souls of those who have died for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> in battle.
        Besides the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of worship, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine complex</ENAMEX>
        includes a noh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater stage</ENAMEX>, a sumo wrestling ring, several teahouses,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yushukan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of war memorabilia.
        Ginza
        Tokyo‚Äôs best-known district is named after a silver mint
        originally located here. Once the epitome of chic, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginza</ENAMEX> has lost many
        of its smartest young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> to the fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> of districts
        like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aoyama</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omote-sando</ENAMEX>, but the area is still fascinating.
        The windows of such department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wako</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> are works of art. Inside, there‚Äôs more art: all the major
        department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> project themselves as bastions of culture,
        maintaining their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and mounting frequent world-class
        exhibitions of prints, painting, pottery, and sculpture. Downstairs you
        can find still more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúart‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇto</ENAMEX> Western eyes at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">least‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇin the
        astonishing basement gourmet food displays. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> is also a
        good place for cheaper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX> than you‚Äôll find in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-level
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>. )
        Running <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly north‚</NUMEX>Äìsouth through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginza</ENAMEX> from the corner
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hibiya Park</ENAMEX> all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Bay</ENAMEX> is the broad avenue called
        Harumi-dori. Taking a stroll down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> is such a national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX> that there‚Äôs even a colloquial expression for it: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX>-bura.
        Just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginza</ENAMEX> itself, as you walk toward the bay, you see on your
        left the red lanterns and long banners of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabuki-za</ENAMEX>, home base for
        that most thrilling and colorful form of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> drama.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> kabuki theater was built in on this site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1889</TIMEX>. Designed to
        invoke the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> period, the theater was
        destroyed in an air raid in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> and rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>.
        Still farther south is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsukiji Central Wholesale</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Market‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe largest fish</ENAMEX> market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 1,600</NUMEX> wholesale dealers
        do business here, supplying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> consumed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. Get here very early (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5am</ENAMEX> is ideal) to see the tuna auctions
        and enjoy the orchestrated pandemonium of the market at its finest.
        From here, you could walk to the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hama Rikyu Detached Palace</ENAMEX>
        Garden. Originally a Tokugawa family estate, the garden became a public
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>. The path to the left as you enter leads to the ferry
        landing, where the ‚Äúriver buses‚Äù depart for their journeys up the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumida River</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asakusa</ENAMEX>.
        Asakusa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asakusa</ENAMEX> is the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shitamachi</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX>
        best-beloved of that fractious, gossipy, prodigal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> called the
        Edokko, who trace their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdowntown‚Äù</ENAMEX> roots back at least three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>. Edokko are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suckers</ENAMEX> for sentimentality and for ninjo: the
        web of small favors and kindnesses that bind them together. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sneeze</ENAMEX> in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">middle of the night</TIMEX> and your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edokko</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> will demand the next
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> that you take better care of yourself; stay home with a fever
        and she will be over by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> with a bowl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Edokko</ENAMEX> craftsman
        would rather lose a commission than take any guff from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> who
        doesn‚Äôt know good work when he sees it. Edokko quarrel in a language
        all their own, an earthy local dialect as profane and expressive as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklynese</ENAMEX>. Ignore the proprieties‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇor offend the pride of an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Edokko‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> he will let you know about it, in no uncertain terms;
        respect his sense of values and you make a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> for life.
        The heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asakusa</ENAMEX>, in turn, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensoji</ENAMEX> (also known as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asakusa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kannon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>). According to legend, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple houses</ENAMEX> a
        small statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of mercy, found in the Sumida
        River by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 628‚ÄÇ‚</TIMEX>Äî‚ÄÇbut in fact not even the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> have ever seen it. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edo</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the
        Tokugawa shogunate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asakusa</ENAMEX> began to flourish as an entertainment
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early-19th century</TIMEX> even the kabuki <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> were
        located here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiji Restoration</ENAMEX> and the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to exotic
        new Western-style amusements further enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Asakusa‚</ENAMEX>Äôs reputation as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fun City</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to call itself a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúbar‚Äù</ENAMEX> opened in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asakusa</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX> (and is still doing business); the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> movie theater
        opened here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX>. Before long, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> were filled with music <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, burlesque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, cabarets,
        gambling dens, and watering holes of every description.
        Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> was firebombed to ashes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>,
        but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of the area had raised enough money to rebuild
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sensoji</ENAMEX> and all of the important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> around it. So what if the
        restorations were in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX>? The original is still there in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spirit‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> should neglect it.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sensoji Temple</ENAMEX> and Surroundings
        Start your exploration from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asakusa Station</ENAMEX>, on the Ginza
        subway line (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first subway). A few steps from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX> is
        Kaminarimon (‚ÄúThunder God <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gate‚Äù</ENAMEX>), the main entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, hung
        with a pair of enormous red paper lanterns. From here, the long, narrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arcade</ENAMEX> called Nakamise-dori is lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toasted rice</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crackers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> in gourd-shaped wooden bottles, dolls, toys, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>,
        children‚Äôs kimono, and ornaments and souvenirs of all sorts. Some of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> have been operated by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        The arcade ends at a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story gate called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hozomon</ENAMEX>. To
        the left is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX>-Story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pagoda</ENAMEX>, and across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is the main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hall of Sensoji</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> should be sure to stop at the huge bronze
        incense burner in front of the hall, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúbathe‚Äù in the smoke‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇan
        observance believed to bestow a year‚Äôs worth of good health.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> to the right of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is the Asakusa

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third weekend</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, is the biggest, most exuberant

        Ueno
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ueno</ENAMEX> was chosen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1625</TIMEX> by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokugawa Shogun Hidetaka</ENAMEX> as the site of a vast temple complex. Called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kan‚Äôeiji</ENAMEX>, it was established on the area‚Äôs one prominent hill to
        protect the capital from evil spirits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kan‚Äôeiji</ENAMEX> was a seat of great
        power until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>, when it became the battleground in the shogunate‚Äôs
        last stand against the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were
        destroyed. Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ueno</ENAMEX> was turned into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first public
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>, endowed with all the preferred Western improvements: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>,
        concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, a library, a university of fine arts, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>. Ueno
        should be a stop on any visitor‚<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Äôs itinerary‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇespecially</ENAMEX> if you happen
        to be here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-April</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry blossoms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> are
        glorious.
        No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> here should miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo National Museum</ENAMEX>, a
        complex of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> art and archaeology
        dating back to the prehistoric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jomon</ENAMEX> and Yayoi periods. Outstanding
        among the exhibits are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> sculpture of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX>- and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heian</ENAMEX> era, illustrated narrative scrolls from the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kamakura</ENAMEX> period, paintings by the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muromachi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>
        Sesshu, and woodblock prints by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edo</ENAMEX>-period masters <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Utamaro</ENAMEX>,
        Hiroshige, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokusai</ENAMEX>.
        Nor should you neglect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of Western Art</ENAMEX>,
        on the east side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ueno Park</ENAMEX>: an outstanding collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        Impressionist paintings, prints, and drawings, the gift of a wealthy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kojiro Matsukata</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> itself was designed by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Corbusier</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodin</ENAMEX> sculptures in the courtyard‚<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Gate of Hell</ENAMEX>,

        Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Edo-</ENAMEX>era <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that have survived or been
        restored, the most important are the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kan‚Äôeiji</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toshogu Shrine</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Tokugawa Shogun Ieyasu‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> lesser version

        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX>). Also of interest is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kiyomizu Kannon Hall</ENAMEX>, modeled
        after the larger and more famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kiyomizu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>; registered
        as a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">National Treasure</ENAMEX>, this is one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that survived
        the battle of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX> intact.
        At the south end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the statue of Saigo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takamori</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> that overthrew the shogunate in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saigo</ENAMEX> is a problematic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> history: in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX> he was
        killed in an unsuccessful rebellion against the very government he
        helped to found. )
        From here, it‚Äôs a short walk west to the grounds of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinobazu Pond</ENAMEX>. Just inside the entrance, on the right, is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shitamachi Customs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manners Museum</ENAMEX>. Budget some time here: it will
        give you a wonderfully concrete sense of the lifestyle that defined
        this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for well over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300 years</TIMEX>. The displays include a
        full-scale reproduction of a nagaya (one of the long, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">single</NUMEX>-story row
        houses typical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Edo</ENAMEX> period). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are welcome to take their
        shoes off and walk through the tatami-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat rooms</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harajuku</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yoyogi Park</ENAMEX>
        The venerable imperial traditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and the frenetic
        celebration of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> culture are arrayed side by side in this
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Harajuku Station</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Railways</ENAMEX>
        Yamanote loop line, it‚Äôs but a few steps to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meiji Jingu</ENAMEX>, the shrine
        dedicated to the spirits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meiji</ENAMEX> (who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1912</TIMEX>) and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empress Shoken</ENAMEX>. The entrance is marked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> huge torii gates,
        their pillars made from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,700-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress trees</ENAMEX>.
        From here, broad gravel paths lead to the honden (the
        sanctum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>), destroyed in the air raids of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> and restored
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Treasure House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>
        presided over the emergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> as a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation state</ENAMEX>, and his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX> is surely the most solemn, decorous place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. During the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">festival</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31 October</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 November</TIMEX>) and on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Year‚Äôs Day</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will come to offer prayers and pay their
        respects. Spring and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> make better visits, when you can admire the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irises</ENAMEX> and flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> of the inner gardens.
        Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yoyogi Park</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is
        remarkable chiefly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Yoyogi Sports Center</ENAMEX>, comprising
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadiums</ENAMEX> designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tange Kenzo</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> itself was
        once a parade ground for the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>
        it was taken over by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Occupation</ENAMEX> for military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">housing</ENAMEX> and nicknamed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">‚ÄúWashington Heights</ENAMEX>,‚Äù then redeveloped as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Olympic Village</ENAMEX> site for
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tokyo Olympic Games</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>, thanks to the broad avenues
        and new subway s tops built for the games, this had become one of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liveliest</ENAMEX>, trendiest, and demographically youngest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and holidays, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX> is closed to traffic. Rock bands that are not quite yet on a
        professional footing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> in their equipment and play <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX>, just
        for practice. The bands are loud‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthey have to be to compete with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX> imitators in black leather jackets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sideburns</ENAMEX> who
        also lay claim to some of this great free space, dancing in circles to
        the oldies on enormous boomboxes. Street <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, body paint, in-your-face
        fashion, photo ops: on a warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yoyogi Park</ENAMEX> is more fun
        than any place in town.
        The opposite (west) end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> borders on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shibuya</ENAMEX>,
        where you can visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHK Broadcasting Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        public television <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">network‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> must for anyone wishing to see how
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samurai</ENAMEX> epics are made. Your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Information Center</ENAMEX>
        will have information on the ‚ÄúStudio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park‚Äù</ENAMEX> guided tour of the NHK

        Shinjuku
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Edo</ENAMEX> period <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shinjuku</ENAMEX> was where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the major roads
        from the west came together. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1900s</TIMEX> the area had become a
        sort of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bohemian quarter</TIMEX>, beloved of the city‚Äôs cliques of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> it emerged as one of
        Tokyo‚Äôs major transportation hubs, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated three million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pass through <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shinjuku Station</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> itself
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">divides Shinjuku</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinctly different areas, east and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">west</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West Shinjuku</ENAMEX> rejoices in a special gift of nature. Its
        relatively stable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bedrock</ENAMEX> can support earthquake-safe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">skyscrapers‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇforemost</ENAMEX> among them is the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Government</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX>, more familiarly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo City Hall</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX> complex
        was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tange Kenzo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">magnum opus</ENAMEX>, arguably the last great work
        of his career. It was a staggeringly expensive project, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX>
        have had an ongoing love-hate relationship with its postmodern
        monumental design since it was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> consists
        of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-story main office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>-story annex, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan</ENAMEX>
        Assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, and a huge central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>. The main building
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">soars 243 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">797 ft</ENAMEX>), splitting on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">33rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>.
        Weather permitting, the observation decks on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">45th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towers</ENAMEX> offer views all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Shinjuku</ENAMEX> is really <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX>: a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime quarter</TIMEX> of
        department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, vertical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>, and discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, and a nighttime
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX> (straight and gay), cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, strip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">honky-tonks‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇmost of the latter in a seedy, neon-lit neighborhood
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kabuki-cho</ENAMEX>. The neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">isn‚</ENAMEX>Äôt really dangerous, but it‚Äôs
        all too easy for the unwary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to wander into a rip-off; if you
        plan to explore <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kabuki-cho</ENAMEX>, do so with a knowledgeable local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX>.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">longish</ENAMEX> walk along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shinjuku</ENAMEX>-dori from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> will
        bring you to the north end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden</ENAMEX>.
        Originally a feudal estate, this collection of gardens (in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> styles) became part of the imperial household after

        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this quarter</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shinjuku Gyoen</ENAMEX> is famous for its botanical
        greenhouse, for its flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, and for its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">chrysanthemum</ENAMEX> exhibition during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two weeks of October</TIMEX>.
        Shinagawa
        Not otherwise rich in tourist attractions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinagawa</ENAMEX> has
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gem</ENAMEX> that should not be missed: Sengakuji‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> that evokes
        what is surely the most popular story in all of premodern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        history.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1701</TIMEX> a young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">provincial baron</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asano Takumi</ENAMEX> no
        Kami, morally insulted by a court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kira</ENAMEX>, attacked and
        wounded his tormentor. Asano was ordered to commit suicide for his
        offense; however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kira</ENAMEX> went free. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asano‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan steward</ENAMEX>, Oishi
        Kuranosuke, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of his loyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retainers</ENAMEX> vowed revenge. On
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1702</TIMEX>, despite many obstacles, they attacked
        Kira‚Äôs heavily guarded villa on the east side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sumida River</ENAMEX>, cut
        off his head, and brought it in triumph to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asano‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sengakuji</ENAMEX>,
        the family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. This was a dilemma for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. On
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hand, their revenge was perfectly in accord with the samurai code
        of honor; on the other, they had murdered a high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>. Eventually,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oishi</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> were also ordered to commit suicide; this they did,
        and they were buried at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sengakuji</ENAMEX> with their lord. Celebrated in kabuki
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theater</ENAMEX>, film, and television, the story has had an abiding hold on the
        imagination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> come annually
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sengakuji</ENAMEX> to lay incense on the tombstones and walk through the

        personal effects, and other memorabilia are preserved.
        Kanto
        The once-marshy plain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanto</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs hinterland, the
        region where the feudal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX> set up their military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">administrative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. Their tough-minded pragmatism survives
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> but also in the dynamic industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> that
        has burgeoned around it in such <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kawasaki</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX>. But
        monuments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamakura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX> still bear testimony to the region‚Äôs
        history. And reigning supreme over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanto</ENAMEX> is a sublime spiritual comment

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1616</TIMEX>. Upon his death he was declared a god by the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grand</ENAMEX> procession to be enshrined here, on the site of a religious
        center founded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some eight centuries</TIMEX> before. In life, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ieyasu</ENAMEX> had made
        himself the absolute monarch of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. His personal fief alone was
        worth enough to feed and support some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. Toshogu, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum complex</ENAMEX> that he commanded for himself in his apotheosis, is
        extraordinary.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX> is best reached from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> (by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>

        is essentially <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX> to the Toshogu
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu Shrine Complex</ENAMEX>
        A short bus ride from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station plaza</ENAMEX> brings you to the
        red-lacquer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shinkyo (‚ÄúSacred Bridge‚Äù</ENAMEX>), a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX>-ft) span over the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiya River</ENAMEX>, where your exploration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu</ENAMEX> begins. The bridge marks
        the spot where the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shodo</ENAMEX> is said to have crossed the
        river in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 766</TIMEX> on the backs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> huge serpents, to found the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> that would later become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rinnoji</ENAMEX>. An entrance to the shrine
        complex is just across the road, opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> and up a flight of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> steps that brings you first to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Shodo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rinnoji</ENAMEX> belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tendai</ENAMEX> sect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX>. The main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hall</ENAMEX>, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanbutsudo</ENAMEX>, with its almost erotic color scheme of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">black</ENAMEX> and green and vermilion, dates to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1648</TIMEX> and is the largest single
        building at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu</ENAMEX>. Inside are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> huge gold-lacquered statues,
        representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different manifestations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amida Nyorai</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> who leads <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX>; on
        the right is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Senju (‚ÄúThousand-Armed‚Äù</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kannon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of mercy; on
        the left is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bato-Kannon</ENAMEX>, depicted with a horse‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> on its forehead,
        regarded as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protector</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is the
        Goho-tendo, a subtemple where worshippers inscribe their prayers for
        health and prosperity on slats of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> that are later burned to carry
        the prayers to heaven. To the south is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Abbot‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇby
        tradition an imperial prince‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwith a particularly fine garden in the
        style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Edo</ENAMEX> period.
        Leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rinnoji</ENAMEX> from the west side, you come to the broad
        Omote-sando <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> that leads uphill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> itself. Note the
        monument to the daimyo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsudaira Masatane, Ieyasu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs trusted retainer.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsudaira</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 20 years</TIMEX> planting the majestic cryptomeria cedars
        on the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> and along the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">64-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40-mile</NUMEX>) avenue of
        approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alas</ENAMEX>, much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> has been destroyed; a few sections
        of it survive on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, where many of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,000</NUMEX> trees
        still standing are maintained by corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX>.
        At the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omote-sando</ENAMEX>, on the left, is the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pagoda</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, decorated with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> signs of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zodiac</ENAMEX> and the hollyhock crest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. From here,
        a flight of stone steps leads to the first gate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu</ENAMEX>: the
        Omotemon, guarded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fierce red-painted Deva <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>. In the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX> is the stable, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the shrine‚Äôs sacred white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>;
        the carved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> above the door is the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monkeys‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚ÄúHear</ENAMEX> no evil, see no evil, speak no evil! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù‚ÄÇ ‚Äî‚ÄÇthat</ENAMEX> has
        become a symbol of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>, the logo on virtually every souvenir. At the
        far end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyozo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sutra Library</ENAMEX>), which houses
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 7,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> scriptures in a huge revolving bookcase.
        As you approach a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> set of stone steps, you see on the
        right a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belfry</ENAMEX> and a tall bronze candelabrum; on the left is a drum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX> and a bronze revolving lantern. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bronzes</ENAMEX> were presented in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-17th century</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, in gratitude for the
        special exemption that gave them exclusive trading privileges with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> during the period of national seclusion. Off to the left is the
        Yakushi-do, a temple honoring the manifestation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> as healer
        of illnesses.
        At the top of the steps is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yomeimon</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúGate of Sunlight‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> triumphal masterpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu</ENAMEX>, rightly
        declared a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">National Treasure</ENAMEX>. This is the ultimate expression of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opulent Momoyama</ENAMEX> style inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX> sculpture and
        architecture. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory</ENAMEX>-white and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ft) high, its columns, beams,
        and cornices are carved with a menagerie of dragons, phoenixes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> in a field of clouds, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">peonies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sages</ENAMEX>, and angels,
        all gilded and painted in red, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, blue, and green. To the right and
        left of the gate there are paneled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, also carved and painted
        with a motifs from nature: pine and plum <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> of the field, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waterfowl</ENAMEX>.
        Inside the gate to the left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mikoshi-gura</ENAMEX>, a
        storeroom for the portable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> that grace the semi-annual Toshogu
        Festival processions (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 October</TIMEX>). To the right is the
        Kaguraden, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> where ceremonial dances are performed to honor the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> where, for a modest fee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> can have Shinto wedding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ceremonies</ENAMEX> performed, complete with flutes and drums and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> maidens
        to attend them.
        Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yomeimon</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, is the Karamon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(‚ÄúChinese Gate‚Äù</ENAMEX>), the official entrance to the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>. This
        structure, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yomeimon</ENAMEX>, is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Treasure</ENAMEX> and just as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ornately</ENAMEX> carved and painted. The walls on both sides of this gate
        enclose the honden (main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>.
        The entrance is to the right. Here you remove your shoes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lockers</ENAMEX> are provided) to visit the outer part of the hall, called the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haiden</ENAMEX> (oratory). You may not proceed further than this, for at the far
        end of the oratory are the naijin (inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>) and nai-naijin
        (innermost chamber), where the spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ieyasu</ENAMEX> is enshrined. With him
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other worthy companions: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Ieyasu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX>,
        and the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minamoto no Yoritomo</ENAMEX>, who founded
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kamakura</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shogunate‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ieyasu</ENAMEX> claimed as an ancestor.
        The tour next takes you to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu</ENAMEX> icon: the famous
        Gate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleeping Cat</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> itself, on a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> above the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entrance</ENAMEX>, is said to have been sculpted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hidari Jingoro</ENAMEX>, a legendary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master carver</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> period. From here a flight of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">207</NUMEX> stone
        steps takes you up through a wonderful forest of cedars to Ieyasu
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokugawa‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb. The climb is worth making, if only for the view, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and a cool, rushing stream. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> itself, a miniature bronze
        pagoda that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the great shogun‚Äôs ashes, is nothing special.
        A short walk west from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu</ENAMEX> itself is surely the oldest
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> on this holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Futarasan Jinja</ENAMEX> is a Shinto
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX> founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 8th century</TIMEX> to honor the deity
        Okuni-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nushi</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-Mikoto (‚ÄúGod of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricefields‚Äù</ENAMEX>), his consort, and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>. In one corner of the enclosure is a bronze lantern <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 2.3 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>) high; the deep nicks in the bronze were made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> on duty at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, who believed that the lantern transformed itself into a
        goblin at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. Such was the incredible cutting power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sword‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇembellished</ENAMEX> perhaps a bit by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> superstition.
        Iemitsu, who was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ieyasu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> Tokugawa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shogun</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1603‚Äì1651</ENAMEX>), undertook the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu</ENAMEX>. He has his own
        resting place here at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiyu</ENAMEX>-in, to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Futarasan</ENAMEX>. Smaller in
        scale, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiyu</ENAMEX>-in is in fact the more impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX>, set on a
        forested hillside and approached by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> flights of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone stairs</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> decorative gates. The most impressive of these, at the top of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stairs</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yashamon (‚ÄúShe-Demon Gate‚Äù</ENAMEX>), so named for the figures in
        its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> alcoves. The sanctum of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, designated a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treasure</ENAMEX>, has a gilded and lacquered altar <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 3 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nearly 10 ft</NUMEX>)
        high, where a seated wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iemitsu</ENAMEX> looks down upon his
        mighty works.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake</ENAMEX> Chuzenji
        The waterfalls and forested hills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko National</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> area are a welcome respite to the monumentality of Tokugawa
        architecture. Even if you are here only on a daytrip, you should take
        the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.2-mile</NUMEX>) bus ride up the spectacular winding Irohazaka
        Highway to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chuzenji</ENAMEX>. Better yet, take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX> and tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> to stop
        at Akechi-daira, the halfway point. The view of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Nantai</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,484 m</NUMEX>;
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8,148 ft</NUMEX>) and the valley below is magnificent.

        made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eons ago</TIMEX> when a now-dormant volcano erupted and blocked the river
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courses</ENAMEX>, creating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cataracts</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">96-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">315-ft</ENAMEX>) Kegon-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-taki at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">south</ENAMEX> end is the country‚Äôs most famous waterfall. An elevator takes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sightseers</ENAMEX> to an observation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> in the gorge below. The falls are
        especially impressive after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> rain, when the sunshine produces a
        single or even double rainbow in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> the falls
        form a spectacular cascade of icicles. At the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gorge‚Äôs</NUMEX> north end,
        Ryuzu-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-taki <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">(‚ÄúDragon‚Äôs Head Falls‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is broader but not as high; it
        has the additional merit of a teahouse, where you can sit and watch the
        water tumble into the lake.
        Famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rainbow trout</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chuzenji</ENAMEX> is too cold for
        swimming most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> throng to this area for its
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spectacular spring</TIMEX> and fall scenery and for its numerous hot springs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>. The most impressive historical monument on the eastern shore
        of the lake is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuzenji</ENAMEX>, a subtemple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshogu‚Äôs Rinnoji</ENAMEX>. The temple
        enshrines a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-ft) standing figure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kannon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Goddess</ENAMEX> of

        centuries of self-imposed isolation came to an end. Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> were at last able to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. But
        the unrest they inspired prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to move them
        all here, to a guarded compound on the village <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flats‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇostensibly</ENAMEX> to
        guarantee their safety, but more importantly to contain the
        contamination of their uncouth ways and ideas.
        The ploy worked well enough until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiji Restoration</ENAMEX>,
        when those Western ideas were needed to modernize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> okohama became an international <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, and the burgeoning
        international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> quickly spread beyond its confinement to the
        high ground still known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bluff</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1872</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railway</ENAMEX> went into service between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, and the city
        began to flourish.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> shared the same destructive fate.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">great Kanto earthquake of 1923</ENAMEX> destroyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 60,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> and took over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> lives. The next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> and growth were wiped out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1945</TIMEX>, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bombers</ENAMEX> leveled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> was hastily
        restored during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Korean War</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is one of the busiest and most
        important trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> in the world.
        With a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> no longer
        sits in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs shadow. In many respects, in fact, it is the more
        cosmopolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, preferred by many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the greater
        metropolitan area as a place to live and work. If you are on a short
        visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, your excursion time might be better spent elsewhere.
        But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yokohama‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great waterfront, port redevelopment project, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> should still keep it high on your list.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Railways Keihin-Tohoku</ENAMEX> line takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 40</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sakuragi-cho Station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX>; the faster
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shinkansen</ENAMEX> leaves you off at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shin</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX>, on the outskirts of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sakuragi</ENAMEX>-cho it‚Äôs a short walk to the waterfront (which is
        still referred to by its old name, the Bund) and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pier</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yamashita Park</ENAMEX>. Here you can take a tour of the harbor on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sightseeing</ENAMEX> launches moored near the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hikawa-</ENAMEX>maru, now retired from
        service. It carried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> for some
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, it has a pleasant beer garden on the upper
        deck.
        At the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pier</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-story Silk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Center Building</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silk Museum</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, with its
        collection of kimono and exhibits of the silk-making process, evokes
        the period when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of that industry. On the first
        floor are the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yokohama International Tourist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX>.
        For a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the harbor, take the elevator to
        the observation deck of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">106-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">348-ft</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Tower</ENAMEX>. The beacon
        atop the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> gives it a claim of being the tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lighthouse</ENAMEX> in the
        world; it also has an interesting oceanographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Minato Mirai 21</ENAMEX> project, launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX>, was
        intended to turn a huge tract of neglected waterfront north and east of
        Sakuragi-cho into a model ‚Äúcity of the future,‚Äù integrating business,
        exhibition, and leisure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. The centerpiece of the project is
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Landmark Tower</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yokohama‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>; its
        observation deck affords a spectacular view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX>
        Bridge, especially at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
        Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yokohama Museum of Art</ENAMEX>, designed by Tange
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenzo</ENAMEX> and housing works by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picasso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braque, Kandinsky, Kishida Ryusei</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yokoyama Taikan</ENAMEX>. On the
        waterfront itself is <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nippon-maru Memorial Park</ENAMEX>, where pride of place
        goes to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-masted sailing ship popularly called the ‚ÄúSwan of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù Now a training <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>, it is open to visitors on guided

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yokohama‚Äôs Chinatown</ENAMEX>, a few minutes‚Äô walk from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railways‚Äô Kannai Station</ENAMEX> in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, is the largest in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. Its narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> are crowded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spices</ENAMEX>, herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>, cookware‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin fact, anything that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>
        exports. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, needless to say, are wonderful.
        Fashionable, upbeat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> is centered in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas. One
        is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Basha-michi (‚ÄúHorse-Carriage Street‚Äù</ENAMEX>) running from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kannai Station</ENAMEX> to
        the waterfront. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> acquired its name in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, when
        it was laid out for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> of the city‚Äôs Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>; a
        more recent redesign evokes that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> with red brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalks</ENAMEX> and
        imitation gas lamps‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> are
        up<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-to-the-minute</TIMEX>. The other area extends from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ishikawa-cho Station</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motomachi</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">International Cemetery</ENAMEX>. Motomachi was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> area
        developed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Meiji</ENAMEX> period to serve Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>, and it has
        kept pace with the movements of fashion ever since.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">International Cemetery</ENAMEX>, established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1854</TIMEX>, is the
        last resting place of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> different
        nationalities who lived and died in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX>. Behind it is the Yamate
        Shiryokan, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of materials about the city‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Just up the hill at this end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motomachi</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Harbor View Park</ENAMEX>, where the views at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">night‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhen Yamashita Park</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> are floodlit‚<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare</ENAMEX> especially fine.
        The last must-see in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> is Sankei-en, originally the
        estate of wealthy silk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX> and art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">connoisseur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hara Tomitaro</ENAMEX>, who
        opened his garden to the public in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1906</TIMEX>. At great expense he
        transferred here a number of important <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that once
        belonged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rinshunkaku villa</ENAMEX> and
        the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Choshukaku</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>, as well as a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> from
        Kyoto‚Äôs famed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daitokuji</ENAMEX>. Sankei-en is a special delight from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
        though early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, when the plum and cherry <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> blossom.
        Kamakura
        Kamakura, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than an hour</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, was
        the seat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamakura</ENAMEX> shogunate
        was founded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late in the 12th century</TIMEX> after a long and bloody rivalry
        between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">noble</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> over control of the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">victorious Minamoto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kamakura</ENAMEX> as its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> because
        this fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">village‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgirded</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by steep wooded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">hills‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwas</ENAMEX> a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fortress</ENAMEX>. Here they created what most of us
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">envision as the ‚ÄúWay</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samurai‚Äù</ENAMEX>: the values, codes, religion, and
        culture of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> caste that would rule <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">700 years</TIMEX>.
        Much of that culture was inspired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rinzai</ENAMEX> sect of Zen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> and its sense of discipline and self-control, its austere
        philosophy of art and life. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shogunate</ENAMEX> founded great numbers of Zen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kamakura</ENAMEX>. Many are still standing, and some are registered
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Treasures</ENAMEX>. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Railways</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kita</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX>)
        Kamakura, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Yokosuka</ENAMEX> line, you can easily
        reach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of these temples.
        Engakuji, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1282</TIMEX>, became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most important
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of monasteries called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gozan (‚ÄúFive Mountains‚Äù</ENAMEX>), a
        hierarchy established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen</ENAMEX> temples under the
        official patronage of the shogunate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engakuji</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamakura‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>; often wracked by fire and earthquake, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Treasures</ENAMEX>: the shariden (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of holy relics), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1282</TIMEX>,
        and the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belfry</ENAMEX> on the hill above. The bell, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 2.5 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8 ft</ENAMEX>)
        tall, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1301</TIMEX>. The principle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engakuji</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">butsunichi-an ceremonial hall</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can take
        part in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony.
        Nearby is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokeiji</ENAMEX>, familiarly known as the ‚ÄúDivorce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which was unique as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caste</ENAMEX> seeking an escape from unhappy marriages. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> managed
        to make her way here and stay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nun</ENAMEX>, she could
        obtain a decree of divorce from the shogunate and go free. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homotsukan</ENAMEX> (treasure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokeiji</ENAMEX> has a collection of
        Kamakura-period paintings, sculpture, and calligraphy, some of which
        are registered as <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Important Cultural Objects</ENAMEX>. Also on the grounds is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsugaoka Bunko</ENAMEX>, a research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> established in memory of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">D.T.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1870‚Äì1966</ENAMEX>), who pioneered the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen Buddhism</ENAMEX> in the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of Tokeiji</ENAMEX>, on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamakura‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Meigetsu</ENAMEX>-in and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jochiji, Zen</ENAMEX> temples with especially fine gardens.
        Still farther south is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenchoji</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1249</TIMEX>, the foremost of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚ÄúFive Mountains</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù It was modeled on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>

        have interceded with the dreaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX> to stop the Mongol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasion of Japan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenchoji</ENAMEX> is still an active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>; like many of
        the temples in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kamakura</ENAMEX>, it offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> the opportunity to take
        part in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zen</ENAMEX> meditation training sessions. Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ennoji</ENAMEX> boasts a

        Sightseeing in Kamakura
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kamakura</ENAMEX> proper, don‚Äôt miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsuru-ga-oka Hachimangu</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine complex</ENAMEX> built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoritomo no Minamoto</ENAMEX>, the first Kamakura
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shogun</ENAMEX>. It was dedicated to the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ojin</ENAMEX>, from whom
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yoritomo</ENAMEX> claimed descent. As part of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-September</TIMEX> festival at this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX>, there is a spectacular tournament of archery on horseback
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">yabusame</NUMEX>), in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contestants</ENAMEX> dressed in the costume of
        Kamakura-period huntsmen must hit a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small wooden
        targets as they come down a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> at full gallop. The spacing
        between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> gives the rider just barely enough time to drop the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reins</ENAMEX>, notch and fire an arrow, and regain control of his mount.
        On the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. The Kamakura

        a later dynasty of shoguns chose to immortalize themselves at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>. In
        many ways <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoritomo</ENAMEX> was a less-than-admirable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        history, but you still might want to stop at this little moss-covered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> pagoda to pay your respects.
        If for nothing else, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoritomo</ENAMEX> earns our admiration for his
        determination to create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúSeated Buddha‚Äù</ENAMEX> for his capital to rival the
        huge bronze figure made in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">749</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Todaiji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nara</ENAMEX>. That idea
        bore <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1292</TIMEX> with the casting of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">120-ton</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Daibutsu</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">courtyard of Kotoku-in temple‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇafter Mr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fuji</ENAMEX>, probably the most
        photographed icon of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. The massive seated figure, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ft)
        high, sits in the classical pose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amida Buddha (‚</ENAMEX>ÄúCompassionate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One‚Äù</ENAMEX>), his hands resting in his lap, the thumbs touching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> and
        the eyes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-closed in an expression of profound serenity. The statue
        is hollow, and you can climb a staircase inside to look out through a
        window between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs shoulders.A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was originally built to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> the figure, but this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was destroyed in a tidal wave in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1495</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the five centuries</TIMEX> since then, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> has been dispensing
        his benevolence to visitors in the open air.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daibutsu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kotoku</ENAMEX>-in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hase</ENAMEX>, the district
        in the western part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamakura</ENAMEX>. The other major attraction here is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasedera</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kannon Hall</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is the largest wooden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devotional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>: a statue of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúEleven-Faced Goddess</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercy</ENAMEX>,‚Äù <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ft) high, carved from a single tree trunk and
        covered in gold leaf. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> symbolize her
        ability to search in all directions for those in need of compassion. No
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> knows for certain when the figure was carved; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> legend dates it
        to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 8th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Amida Hall of Hasedera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the image
        of a seated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amida Buddha</ENAMEX>, endowed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minamoto no Yoritomo</ENAMEX> when he was
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42‚</NUMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa particularly unlucky age according to popular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> belief.
        Yoritomo‚Äôs piety bought him a little more time to enjoy his success; he
        was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> when he was thrown by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> and died of his injuries.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamakura</ENAMEX> history was not shaped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minamoto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> alone.
        No account of this area would be complete without the story of Nichiren
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1222‚Äì1282</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> who founded the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">native Japanese</ENAMEX> sect of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX>. Nichiren‚Äôs defiance of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jodo (‚ÄúPure Land‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> eventually persuaded the shogunate to order him beheaded on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX> to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hase</ENAMEX>. However, legend says that, just as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">executioner</ENAMEX> raised his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX>, a lightning bolt struck and broke it in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. Before he could try again, a messenger arrived with an order
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commuting Nichiren‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sentence to exile on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sadogashima</ENAMEX>.
        Later, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1337</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nichiren</ENAMEX> sect built the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ryukoji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX>.
        On the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sagami</ENAMEX> bayshore are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuigahama</ENAMEX> and
        Shichirigahama, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the beaches closest to the metropolitan area. In
        the hot, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">humid summer months</TIMEX> it can feel as if the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> is here, searching in vain for a vacant patch of
        sand. Equally popular is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enoshima</ENAMEX>, the little island just offshore,
        with a hill in the middle that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">affords‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇon clear days‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> fine view of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Izu Peninsula</ENAMEX>.
        Hakone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hakone</ENAMEX> is a national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> area southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX>, extremely popular with weekend trippers from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. Just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, this area makes a very pleasant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daytrip</ENAMEX>. But to enjoy more of the countryside, you can stay overnight
        and continue down the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Izu Peninsula</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>.
        Even if you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Railpass</ENAMEX>, we suggest that you
        invest in the all-inclusive ‚ÄúHakone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Pass‚Äù</ENAMEX> offered by the Odakyu
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railway</ENAMEX>. This entitles you to a roundtrip train ticket from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinjuku</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gora</ENAMEX>, connecting with the funicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> up into the mountains to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. You then swing across the volcanic Owakudani valley and down
        the other side for a boat cruise across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Ashi</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hakone</ENAMEX>-machi. From
        there, you can take a bus (still on the same pass) along the Sumiko
        River to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Odawara</ENAMEX>, and then back by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
        Among the many attractions of this excursion is the Hakone
        Open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chokoku</ENAMEX> no mori, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúForest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sculptures</ENAMEX>) at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miyanoshita</ENAMEX>. Established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> rejoices in a wonderfully
        designed and landscaped mountain setting. Here the works of such
        Western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sculptors</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calder</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giacometti</ENAMEX> share the
        garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shimizu Takashi, Takamura Kotaro</ENAMEX>, and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. The exhibits are chosen for their resistance to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is as lovely in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> as it is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> stop here on the way to the little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gora</ENAMEX>,
        to catch the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sozan</ENAMEX> and from there the gondola ride up into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> and across the smoking, sulfurous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Owakudani valley</ENAMEX>.
        There‚Äôs a stop en route where you can visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owakudani Natural</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Museum</ENAMEX>, which has some uninspiring audio-visual presentations
        of volcanic eruptions. Down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> is the really interesting
        display: an array of seismographs busily recording the movement of the
        vast tectonic plates deep below.
        Ride the next cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to the shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ashi</ENAMEX>, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">excursion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cruisers</ENAMEX> leave from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">piers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Togendai</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX>
        ride to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hakone</ENAMEX>-machi on the other side of the lake. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX> the
        reflection of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX> in these clear blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> is breathtaking. In
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early August</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lakeshore</ENAMEX> sponsor the dramatic Torii
        Matsuri festival, when a great wooden arch is set alight and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a thousand</NUMEX>
        burning lanterns are sent floating out across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> period Hakone-machi was an important town
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokaido</ENAMEX>, the only <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> through this mountainous area between
        the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> and the shogunal capital in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edo</ENAMEX>. The
        shogunate, always suspicious of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the move, maintained a system
        of garrisons along the road, and no one went through without an
        official pass. The checkpoint here, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hakone Sekisho</ENAMEX>, is an
        exact replica of the original, with a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of period costumes
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. The surrounding area is well known for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> and
        thermal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> and for its Hakone-zaiku woodcrafts with inlaid mosaic
        and marquetry.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Izu Peninsula</ENAMEX>
        The jumping-off point for this popular vacation area is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atami</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> on the shinkansen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">super-express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Izu Peninsula</ENAMEX> is blessed with a sunny climate,
        fine beaches, picturesque little fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">and‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇperhaps</ENAMEX> more to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">point‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsome</ENAMEX> of the country‚Äôs best hot springs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort towns</ENAMEX> are of special interest to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westerners</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ito</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atami</ENAMEX> on the east
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 800</NUMEX> thermal springs and good surf swi mming
        along its beautiful, rugged coast. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Omura-san Park</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cherry trees</ENAMEX>, with different varieties blooming at different times of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. Historically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ito</ENAMEX> was home for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Adams</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman shipwrecked</ENAMEX> on the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 17th</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> who became an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa Ieyasu</ENAMEX>. For his knowledge of
        seafaring, he was given the title <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anjin (‚Äúpilot‚Äù</ENAMEX>). At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ieyasu‚Äôs</ENAMEX> command,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> (the model for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Clavell‚Äôs</ENAMEX> novel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shogun</ENAMEX>) set up a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shipyard in Ito</ENAMEX> and built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style ocean-going
        vessels. There is a monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> at the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okawa River</ENAMEX>,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Anjin Festival</ENAMEX> is held in his honor every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>.
        Shimoda, at the southern tip of the peninsula, is famous
        in still another historical context. It was off the coast here that
        Commodore <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Perry</ENAMEX>, ordered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to open
        diplomatic relation with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> if necessary, anchored his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fleet</ENAMEX> of black <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shogunate</ENAMEX> bowed to the pressure and agreed to
        accept <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Townsend Harris</ENAMEX>, who established the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        consulate at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gyokusenji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shimoda</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1856</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years later</TIMEX>, at
        nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ryosenji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, negotiations resulted in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> US‚ÄìJapan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treaty of Amity and Commerce</ENAMEX>. The monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX>, not far
        from the harbor, celebrates these epochal events, as does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimoda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> Kurobune <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Matsuri (‚ÄúBlack Ship Festival‚Äù</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>.
        In fact, charming though it still is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as a fishing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">port</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimoda</ENAMEX> was worthless from the commercial or
        diplomatic perspective. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shogunate</ENAMEX> had simply stuck <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> there to
        keep the dreaded Westerners away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. Later, he negotiated
        the opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yokohama</ENAMEX> as a trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and foreign settlement. Such
        was the subsequent dismay among reactionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> at this sign of
        weakness that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shogunate was soon overthrown.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX>
        Most of the world‚Äôs national symbols‚<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Statue of</ENAMEX>

        Japan‚Äôs is a phenomenon of nature. And yet, in its near perfect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symmetry</ENAMEX>, the cone of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX>, snowcapped even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, is so
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exquisitely</ENAMEX> formed that it seems more like the work of an infinitely
        patient landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> than a volcanic accident. The solitary
        majestic peak rises <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,776 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12,385 ft</NUMEX>) into the heavens. It is, in a
        word, simply beautiful. Here, more than in any temple garden or ancient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castle</ENAMEX> ground, you can appreciate why the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> prefer to blur the
        distinction between nature and art.
        The volcano‚Äôs name is thought to derive from an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ainu</ENAMEX> word
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúfire</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚Äù Fuji-san</ENAMEX> last erupted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1707</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> only an
        occasional puff of steam breaks through its crust, the fitful snore of
        a sleeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graciously</ENAMEX>, it remains dormant for the sake of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> to climb to the
        summit.
        For some, the climb is an act of piety: the mountain is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">revered</ENAMEX> as the abode of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Japan‚Äôs ancestral gods</ENAMEX>. For others, the climb
        is an exercise in self-discipline and physical purification. Still
        others come out of no particular religious impulse, on holiday, making
        the ascent mainly to be able to say they‚Äôve done it and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">leaving‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalmost</ENAMEX> in spite of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">themselves‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwith</ENAMEX> a profound sense of
        spiritual uplift. No travel brochure can make <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX> a clich√©, nor
        can the most jaded of world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> remain immune.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> begin their climb at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kawaguchi Lake</ENAMEX>, in the
        resort <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> north of the mountain, getting that far by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about two hours</TIMEX>. The official climbing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July to 31</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, although mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">huts</ENAMEX> at each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> on the
        various routes of ascent are open from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-November</TIMEX>. Climbing
        ‚Äúout of season‚Äù (especially in wet weather) is not recommended, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do it all the time.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kawaguchi</ENAMEX>, you take a local bus to Go<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-gome (‚</NUMEX>ÄúFifth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Station‚Äù</ENAMEX>) on the north face, to start the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-hour</TIMEX> hike to the summit.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a direct bus to this point from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shinjuku</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> terminal
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> that takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about two and a half hours</TIMEX>. If you‚Äôre coming from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> or bus connections bring you to the
        Fujino-miya trail, on the south face.
        Truly dedicated pilgrims begin the climb around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>,
        reaching the top in time to greet the sunrise. There‚Äôs no danger of
        losing the well-marked trail, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> ascent obviates the need to
        put up at any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dormitory</ENAMEX>-style mountain huts along the way (where
        the accommodations are truly awful). You can stop at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eighth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> to rest en route. Pack extra-warm clothing and wear good
        hiking boots, hats, and gloves. Bad junk food from vending machines is
        all that‚Äôs available at the summit, so it‚Äôs best to bring your own
        supplies and, above all, a thermos of hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji-san</ENAMEX> is like any other mountain in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> respect: it‚Äôs a
        lot easier coming down. More adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> will take the descent
        down the volcanic sand slide called the suna-bashiri to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shin</ENAMEX>-Go-gome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">(‚ÄúNew Fifth Station‚Äù</ENAMEX>). Just sit on your backpack or a piece of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cardboard</ENAMEX>, push off, and slither down. From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shin</ENAMEX>-Go-gome, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> connect
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gotemba</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections home</ENAMEX>.
        Don‚Äôt confine your visit to the mountain only. The Fuji
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes</ENAMEX> that form a crescent around the north side of the peak offer
        delightful opportunities for fishing, boating, and hiking. Yamanaka-ko
        is the largest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>. Kawaguchi-ko is the most popular, probably
        because of the excursion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> that ply the route along the north
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shore</ENAMEX>, where‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwith luck and good weather‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou get a perfect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mirror</ENAMEX>-image reflection of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Sai-ko has the best
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trout</ENAMEX> fishing, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shoji-ko</ENAMEX> is smallest, prettiest, and still
        relatively undeveloped. Motosu-ko is the clearest and deepest of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>.
        Between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sai-ko and Shoji-ko</ENAMEX> lies the dense, mysterious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jukai (‚ÄúSea</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trees‚Äù</ENAMEX>), a forest notorious for being easier to enter
        than to leave. The volcanic substrata here throw magnetic compasses
        completely out of whack. Many holiday <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> lose their way, some of
        them on purpose: the eerie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jukai</ENAMEX> is a perennial favorite with would-be
        suicides, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> conduct a sweep of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forest</ENAMEX> to recover the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> that would otherwise never be discovered.
        Due south of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motosu-ko</ENAMEX>, the glistening white <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>-ft) Shiraito
        Falls make a far more cheerful setting for a picnic.
        Kansai
        Embracing the historical and cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> and
        Nara, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ise-Shima</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, and the vibrant commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansai</ENAMEX> region is essentially the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> usually provides the first glimpse of modern
        Japan‚Äôs many strange contrasts, it is to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX> that visitors
        with even a passing interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> history and culture come to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peel</ENAMEX> back the layers of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> is internationally
        renowned as the country‚Äôs de facto cultural capital, nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nara</ENAMEX> was
        the first important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and still boasts many of
        Japan‚Äôs most important temples and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ise-Shima National Park</ENAMEX> is the supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> of
        Japan‚Äôs ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shinto</ENAMEX> deities. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> and neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX> offer
        striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perspectives</ENAMEX> of modern commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, albeit on a more
        accessible and less intimidating scale than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sprawling urban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conglomeration</ENAMEX>. No other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> offers the same combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> intensity, rural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tranquillity</ENAMEX>, and dramatic cultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treasures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> all in such close proximity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX>
        For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of would-be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> around the world, the
        very name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX> conjures up images of the exotic and the foreign. Here
        you will find magnificent temples, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, and pagodas; exquisite Zen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX>; sumptuous traditional feasts; and, of course, that most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alluring</ENAMEX> and misunderstood of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">creatures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe kimono</ENAMEX>-clad geisha. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX>
        is the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for such traditional disciplines as cha-do (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
        ceremony) and ikebana (flower arranging), the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of kabuki, and
        the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of calligraphy, painting, and sculpture.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has a unique place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> national
        identity, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is estimated to
        visit the city <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>. Despite this, in many ways <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> is a
        surprisingly typical modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with the usual nondescript
        concrete <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> along with the remarkable pockets of culture and
        beauty.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> served as the cultural and
        spiritual capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> civilization, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of its revered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emperors</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Nara</ENAMEX> period from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 8th century</TIMEX> up to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiji Restoration</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late-19th century</TIMEX>. The imperial rulers
        moved the capital to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX> originally to escape from the growing
        domination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX>. In the new capital the
        building of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples was actually briefly banned‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇironic in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> now universally renowned for its temples.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> simply means ‚<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ÄúCapital City</ENAMEX>,‚Äù though it was
        originally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Heian-kyo (‚ÄúCapital of Peace‚Äù</ENAMEX>), the name given to
        the golden <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heian</ENAMEX> era between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th centuries</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time Kyoto</ENAMEX> thrived as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cultural and creative <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">heartland</ENAMEX>. But the
        city‚Äôs fortunes turned during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warring States</ENAMEX> period (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1467‚Äì1568</ENAMEX>),
        which was finally ended by the unifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobunaga</ENAMEX> and Hideyoshi
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-16th century</TIMEX>.
        In many ways the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has never recovered from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hideyoshi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        subsequent decision to move the national capital from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edo</ENAMEX> (now
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1600s‚ÄÇ‚</TIMEX>Äî‚ÄÇa blow compounded by the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Meiji</ENAMEX> shifting the imperial household to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> has
        nevertheless remained the repository of the nation‚Äôs noblest cultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pursuits</ENAMEX> and architectural legacy.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚Äôs Imperial Residences</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto Gosho</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katsura</ENAMEX> and
        Shugakuin imperial villas are mandatory destinations for anyone with
        even a shred of interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> architecture, design, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aesthetics</ENAMEX>. However, since they are imperial property, special
        reservations must be made with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Household Agency</ENAMEX> (located on the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Palace</ENAMEX>, just
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south of Imadegawa-dori</ENAMEX>; passports are required). Overseas reservations
        are not accepted.
        Fires ravaged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX>, and the present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> reconstruction.
        Through the western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Seishomon Gate</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shishinden</ENAMEX> ceremonial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>,
        where emperors are enthroned‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> privilege retained by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> after the
        move to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Year‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> are held. To the west is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cypress-wood Seiryoden</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúSerene and Cool Chamber‚Äù</ENAMEX>), the
        emperor‚Äôs private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>, serene and cool indeed in vermilion, white,
        and black.
        If you must visit only one of the two imperial villas,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katsura</ENAMEX> is the ultimate ‚Äúmust see‚Äù in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> full of them. Conceived
        with meticulous care, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katsura</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs masterpieces of subtle
        residential design and garden landscaping. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> in the villa‚Äôs
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> pavilions is a sliding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> that can be opened to survey the
        surrounding landscape, including the gardens themselves and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arashiyama Hills</ENAMEX> beyond. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furushoin</ENAMEX> pavilion‚Äôs verandah is the
        perfect place for viewing the full moon.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shugakuin imperial villa</ENAMEX> lies at the foot of sacred
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mt. Hiei</ENAMEX>. Its spacious grounds are a magnificent example of the
        ‚Äústrolling‚Äù gardens favored during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Edo</ENAMEX> period. Built by the shogun
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> for an abdicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shugakuin</ENAMEX> is in fact
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> villas, each with airy teahouses in the gardens. The upper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">villa‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgrandest</ENAMEX> of the three‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdominates an imposing avenue of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pines</ENAMEX>.
        Exploring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX> is surprisingly large. Since its numerous
        attractions are spread evenly throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, good maps are
        essential. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subway <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lines</ENAMEX>, several small private railway
        lines, and many bus routes. If you don‚Äôt want to depend on costly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">taxis</ENAMEX>, make sure you have a bus map, which can be picked up at the
        tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto Station</ENAMEX> or at any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JNTO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.
        However, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 1,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Shinto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, numerous

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accommodation</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sampling Kyoto</ENAMEX> is definitely a case of ‚Äúless is more. ‚Äù
        The secret is to pace yourself. It is far better to allow a daily
        ration of a couple of major temples, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and a strolling garden
        or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> than to cram everything into a short time, leaving only a blur
        of each and a lasting impression of none.
        Higashiyama
        On the city‚Äôs east side, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Higashiyama</ENAMEX> boasts temples,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kiyomizu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest, is so popular that
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> it offers all the serenity of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs garish
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. But don‚Äôt let that put you off. Founded in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">788</NUMEX> just before
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> entered its golden age as the imperial capital, its numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings nestle lovingly</ENAMEX> against steep <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Higashiyama</ENAMEX> in a dramatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cascade</ENAMEX> of thatched and tiled roofs. However, most of what we see today
        is actually a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> reconstruction of the original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8th-century</TIMEX>
        structure. With its numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> set within extensive grounds,
        Kiyomizu‚Äôs main attraction is the hondo (main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>). This elevated
        structure‚Äôs projecting wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> is supported by a vast
        arrangement of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> massive interlocking beams. Across on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mountainside</ENAMEX> is another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> on which imperial courtiers and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dignitaries</ENAMEX> would sit while enjoying dance performances and music
        recitals on the hondo‚Äôs broad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>. (The popular expression ‚ÄúTo jump
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiyomizu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs terrace‚Äù means to do something daring and adventurous,
        although this is best left to the imagination. )
        Crowds flock here to take in the bright yet delicate hues
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry blossoms</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> or the blaze of red and gold maple leaves
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>, with special night-time illuminations (check at any tourist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for dates and times).
        A moderate stroll takes you to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Higashiyama‚Äôs</ENAMEX> Gion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">district, Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, arts,
        and (now) antiques. It is especially renowned as the last center of
        training for the city‚Äôs most celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, the geisha. This is
        the place to wander and soak up the sights and sounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs lone
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> still dedicated to traditional arts and entertainment. Your
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">curiosity</ENAMEX> and patience will inevitably reward you with a glimpse of a
        genuine geisha or maiko (apprentice geisha), the copious layers of her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">opulent‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand unimaginably heavy‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsilk kimono</ENAMEX> rustling as she hurries
        to an appointment or a training session.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gion</ENAMEX> is a global magnet for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antiques</ENAMEX>. Prices are usually high. But even if you‚Äôre not in
        the market for a major investment, antique-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">browsing</ENAMEX> is a
        marvelous way to get a real taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs celebrated traditional
        design and aesthetics. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are more like small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>,

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. In a comfortable little theater you can watch a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX>
        demonstration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony, traditional music and dance, flower
        arranging, puppet theater, and a kyogen farce. (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tickets for Gion Corner</ENAMEX>
        are usually available through your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Information</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>. )
        At the northeast corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gion</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maruyama Park</ENAMEX>, one of
        Kyoto‚Äôs most popular recreation areas, which borders <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX>. The massive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chioninji</ENAMEX> is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jodo (‚ÄúPure Land‚Äù</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> sect, which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX> spread the appeal of Buddhism
        to the uneducated classes. Looming to an imposing height of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>), its entrance gate is thought to be the largest structure of its
        kind in the world. The ringing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chioninji‚</ENAMEX>Äôs bell, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs large st
        and best known, is televised nationally when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> monks usher in
        the new year.
        A huge arch (torii) spanning the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> marks the
        approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heian Shrine</ENAMEX>. This popular shrine features a strongly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-influenced design and an extensive landscaped garden considered
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest, with numerous cherry <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and a large pond with
        an elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pagoda</ENAMEX> linked to the shore by a covered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>.
        In the vicinity are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> absorbing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> reflecting
        Kyoto‚Äôs extensive history as a magnet for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Traditional Industry</ENAMEX> presents a diverse collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">textiles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX>, dolls, lacquerware, cutlery, and
        cabinetwork, with occasional live demonstrations by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>. Next
        door, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX> is, despite its name, mainly
        devoted to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th- and 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>.
        At the northern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Higashiyama</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most
        famous and delightful short walks<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">: the Philosopher‚Äôs Path</ENAMEX>, stretching
        along a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> running <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">temples‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇNanzenji</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginkakuji</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanzenji</ENAMEX> is a former <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">precincts</ENAMEX>
        now house <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> and monasteries. The great gate at
        the main entrance was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1628</TIMEX> and became notorious as the site
        where a robber named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goemon Ishikawa</ENAMEX> was boiled alive in an iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cauldron</ENAMEX> while holding his son aloft to save him from the same fate.
        Since then, old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bathtubs</ENAMEX> have been gruesomely
        known as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúgoemon-¬≠buro</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù The view from atop the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX>-ft) gate
        provides a fine overall view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> grounds and sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt.</ENAMEX> Hiei
        to the north. The temple‚Äôs truly unique feature is the large red-brick
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aqueduct</ENAMEX> behind the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, which still carries <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biwa</ENAMEX> and is a popular strolling route for local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>.
        Not far from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nanzenji</ENAMEX> is the wonderful Eikan-do, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">exquisite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> set against the hillside. Its beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amida Buddha</ENAMEX>
        statue is, unusually, turning to look back over its shoulder. Its
        strange posture commemorates a legendary statue that came to life and
        then berated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eikan</ENAMEX>, the astonished <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> looking on, for pausing from
        his ritual chanting. Each fall the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> has a special night-time
        illumination of its many <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">maple trees</ENAMEX>, their flaming <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX>
        highlighted with strategically placed pin-spotlights. The effect is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sublime</ENAMEX> and utterly unforgettable.
        Despite the large numbers who come to view the spring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blossoms</ENAMEX> and the superb fall leaves, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Philosopher‚Äôs Path</ENAMEX> is one of
        Kyoto‚Äôs most tranquil and beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">strolls</ENAMEX>. Any of the several friendly
        little teahouses and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> along the way make an ideal rest
        stop.
        At the other end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major temple
        on the path. Ginkakuji, the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúSilver Pavilion</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù</ENAMEX> never received
        the silver-leaf covering originally intended. It was built in the 15th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> by an aesthete-mystic shogun, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshimasa Ashikaga</ENAMEX>, who used it
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">esoteric tea</ENAMEX> ceremonies and, above all, moon-watching in the
        elegant garden. Its flat-topped hillock of white gravel, despite the
        inevitable comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX>, reputedly originated as a pile of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sand</ENAMEX> left behind by the temple‚Äôs construction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>.
        A short bus ride delivers you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto National</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the country‚Äôs largest collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        sculpture and painting as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, traditional armor, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
        centuries of costume including some dazzling noh theater costumes with
        masks. Most of this peerless collection has been gathered from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nara</ENAMEX>, and other important cultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX>.
        Just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum</ENAMEX> is the spectacular
        Sanjusangendo, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúHall of Thirty-Three Bays</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù The original temple
        built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1164</TIMEX> survived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 100 years</TIMEX>, and today‚Äôs reconstruction dates
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the 13th century</TIMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centerpiece</ENAMEX> is a gilded seated wooden statue
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kannon Bodhisattva</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ft) high, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> faces on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> (extravagantly known as ‚Äúa thousand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arms‚Äù</ENAMEX>) wielding bells, wheels, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lotus flowers</ENAMEX>. However,
        Sanjusangendo‚Äôs main wonder is its legion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> gilded Kannon images
        flanking the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. The identical statues were carved by the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kokei</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Unkei</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tankei</ENAMEX>, ably aided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ukyo</ENAMEX> and Kita
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> on the west and north sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to most of the city‚Äôs major temples, set within the surrounding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">greenery</ENAMEX> and mountains that prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kammu</ENAMEX> to select this
        site for his new capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heian-kyo</ENAMEX>, in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">794</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestled</ENAMEX> in the northwest corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryoanji</ENAMEX> is the
        best known of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zen Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples. Its famous rock garden has
        provoked more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">debates‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇboth admiring</ENAMEX> and critical‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthan there are
        chips of gravel in its rectangular <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30-m by 10-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">98-ft by 32-ft</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expanse</ENAMEX>. There are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> stark rocks
        embellished with ancient moss, standing in clusters amid the perfectly
        raked white gravel. Although it is usually attributed to the great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">master Soami</ENAMEX>, nobody knows for sure who created it‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇor why. The
        mystery surrounding its origins does nothing to undermine the power of
        its simplicity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confounding</ENAMEX> interpretation, it epitomizes the essence
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen Buddhism‚Äôs</ENAMEX> essentially anti-intellectual precepts. Dark islands
        in a white sea, or mountain peaks soaring above clouds: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> see what
        they want to see. Get there <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> before the crowds
        arrive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX> offers few more memorable experiences than secluded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contemplation of Ryoanji‚</ENAMEX>Äôs enigmatic rock garden.
        Beyond the rock garden you can walk among the maples and
        pines of the forest surrounding the lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoyochi Pond</ENAMEX> at the foot of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mt. Kinugasa</ENAMEX>. Thick, luxuriant moss thrives throughout.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ryoanji</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> stroll or a short bus ride takes
        you to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kinkakuji, Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúTemple of the Golden Pavilion</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù The
        original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>, completely covered in gold leaf,
        was typical of the unrestrained opulence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Muromachi</ENAMEX> period
        favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shogun Yoshimitsu Ashikaga</ENAMEX>, who had it built for his
        retirement at the ripe old age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>. It was burned down by a fanatical
        young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX> as an exact replica of the original
        structure, and renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> with a brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>-foil covering.
        Most of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are closed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but you pass an
        attractive thatch-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>-ceremony <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> as you follow the winding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> steps toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX>.
        Another celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of fire is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daitokuji</ENAMEX>. This vast
        complex of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> subtemples and affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monasteries</ENAMEX> (down from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60</NUMEX>
        during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Edo</ENAMEX> period) was built, burned down, and rebuilt between the
        14th and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th centuries</TIMEX>. It is richly endowed with artistic treasures
        and some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most superb Zen gardens, reflecting its history as
        a renowned center of calligraphy, gardening, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony, and other
        refined arts.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daitokuji‚Äôs Zen</ENAMEX> subtemples in particular offer
        superb gardens, teahouses, and artifacts. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Daisen</ENAMEX>-in, the ‚ÄúZen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>
        Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äù</ENAMEX> contains splendid painted fusuma (sliding panels) and
        wall paintings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Zuiho</ENAMEX>-in is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> whose curious gardens combine
        Zen <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> symbolism, together with both an attractive
        rock garden and a unusually geometric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> garden. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ryugen</ENAMEX>-in has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        distinct rock gardens, one of which is apparently the smallest in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West of Daisen</ENAMEX>-in is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juko</ENAMEX>-in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sen</ENAMEX> no
        Rikyu, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony and its most celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>,
        is buried. His death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1591</TIMEX> by seppuku (the ritual disemboweling more
        crudely known to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX> as harakiri) was in fact commanded by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</ENAMEX>, his former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rikyu</ENAMEX> apparently
        incurred the warlord‚Äôs wrath by placing a statue of himself in the
        large main gate, under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hideyoshi</ENAMEX> would have had to pass‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇan
        intolerable affront to a famously proud <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX>.
        To the south is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitano Temmangu</ENAMEX>, a large and important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Temmangu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> typically feature statues
        of seated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bulls</ENAMEX> believed to have healing properties. You will
        always see someone rubbing the part of a statue corresponding to an
        afflicted area in the hope of relief from pain and worry. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is
        also known for its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of plum <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, whose deep pink blooms draw
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weeks</TIMEX> preceding the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry</ENAMEX> blossom frenzy. But
        the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> descend on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 25th of each month</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitano Temmangu</ENAMEX>
        hosts its nationally famous flea market. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> travel from afar to
        sift through the offerings of used kimono, antique furniture and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramics</ENAMEX>, antique scrolls, crafts, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, household items, and countless
        other categories of bric-a-brac and sundries, paying prices ranging
        from the reasonable to the outrageous.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Kyoto</ENAMEX>
        To the southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto Station</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toji</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        oldest temples, whose massive pagoda is the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. Toji was
        established just after the imperial capital moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">794</TIMEX>,
        built with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> from sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Inari</ENAMEX> in the south. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thirty years later</TIMEX>
        Kukai, the revered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of esoteric <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shingon Buddhism</ENAMEX>, was appointed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head abbot</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> complex quickly became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shingon Buddhism</ENAMEX>, which it remains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. In addition to its impressive
        pagoda, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toji</ENAMEX> is a national magnet for bargain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> at its huge
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> flea market held on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st of each month</TIMEX>.
        Just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jodo-Shinshu (‚ÄúPure Land‚Äù</ENAMEX>) sect, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi-Honganji</ENAMEX> and
        Higashi-Honganji temples. The latter was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shogun Ieyasu</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> to split and counteract the powerful influence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi-Honganji</ENAMEX>, which had attracted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> with its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">free-wheeling Buddhism</ENAMEX>: it allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> to marry and have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>,
        permitted the eating of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, and renounced traditional ascetic
        practices.
        Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Higashi-Honganji</ENAMEX> is closed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but the
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and founder‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX> after repeated fires, are
        notable for the rather gross ropes of human hair fashioned from
        donations by female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worshippers</ENAMEX> to haul the temple‚Äôs pillars into
        position. There is much more to see in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi-Honganji</ENAMEX>, an
        outstanding example of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese Buddhist</ENAMEX> monumental architecture,
        combining a bold, dramatic silhouette with rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ornamentation</ENAMEX>. The
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> owe much of their splendor to the structures
        brought here from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hideyoshi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs opulent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fushimi Castle</ENAMEX> on the south side
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> (dismantled by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokugawa shogun in 1632).</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nijo Castle</ENAMEX> is a poignant monument to the ironic twists of
        history. Built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ieyasu Tokugawa</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1603</TIMEX> for his occasional, reluctant
        visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> (under imperial command), the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> was taken over by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meiji</ENAMEX> after the restoration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>. It was here that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emperor</ENAMEX> signed the edict abolishing the shogunate and sent his
        carpenters round the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> hollyhock crest
        with the imperial chrysanthemum.
        For a change of pace and mood, seek out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nishiki Market</ENAMEX>.
        This remarkably tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> market is housed under a single arcade.
        Note the colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dried fish</ENAMEX> and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, colorful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pickles</ENAMEX>, stout young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bamboo</ENAMEX> shoots, chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX> and breasts arranged
        in elaborate patterns, and a whole cornucopia of squid, mussels,
        oysters, and giant scallops.
        Nearby, leading north from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shiji-dori</ENAMEX>, is another
        important market area worth exploring: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teramachi</ENAMEX> (literally, ‚Äútemple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">district‚Äù</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hideyoshi</ENAMEX> moved many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs temples to this long narrow
        road during his reorganization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1591</TIMEX> following its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">near-total</ENAMEX> destruction by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> warfare. Although small temples and
        shrines remain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> will enjoy exploring the covered shopping
        arcade between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shijo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanjo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, famous for its second-hand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bookstores</ENAMEX>, traditional hand-made paper (washi) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, trendy but
        sometimes creative clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, and numerous pickle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Oike</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teramachi</ENAMEX> becomes home to some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        most respected antique and washi <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, some of which have been in
        business for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adjoining streets</ENAMEX> comprise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
        Japan‚Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> for traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> style tables, screens,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Kyoto</ENAMEX>
        It is impossible to overstate the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> culture. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Each year</TIMEX> in an important ceremony, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plants rice</ENAMEX> in a symbolic field, reinforcing his role as the hereditary
        link between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shinto gods</ENAMEX>. So important is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice</ENAMEX> that it has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinto deity Inari</ENAMEX> all to itself. There are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inari</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, distinguished by a pair of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foxes</ENAMEX> standing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, however, boasts the most famous of them all‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fushimi-Inari Shrine</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>. In a city overpopulated by
        must-see attractions, this is one place guaranteed to deplete whatever
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superlatives</ENAMEX> remain in your exhausted vocabulary. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most extensive, with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox</ENAMEX> motifs
        everywhere. But take the path at the top right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> and you
        come to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fushimi-Inari‚</ENAMEX>Äôs remarkable features: its long,
        meandering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> of bright orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">torii arches</ENAMEX>. Purchased by both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> (at vast expense) in the hope of incurring
        the blessings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, the torii become smaller as you progress
        through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> and begin to ascend the mountain. Farther on you
        come to an amazing double <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>, forcing you to choose the left or
        right paths. Along the way to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Inari</ENAMEX>, you will pass many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subshrines</ENAMEX> and countless bright red torii both minute and massive. Make
        sure you have plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">film‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou‚</ENAMEX>Äôll need it all.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Fushimi</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tofukuji</ENAMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> complex.
        In addition to many impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tofukuji</ENAMEX> offers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        remarkable and distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zen</ENAMEX> gardens located in the hojo (abbot‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quarters</ENAMEX>). At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tofukuji‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ravine</ENAMEX> containing a small forest

        Excursions from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arashiyama</ENAMEX>. When mind and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> are ready for a break from
        the rigors of cultural sightseeing, head down to the southern resort
        district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arashiyama</ENAMEX>, perched along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hozu River</ENAMEX> (or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oi</ENAMEX>, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also known). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">maple trees</ENAMEX> setting off the river and the famous
        old wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Togetsukyo Bridge</ENAMEX> make it very popular with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>,
        so it is worth avoiding on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and public <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arashiyama</ENAMEX> is home to a number of important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nonomiya Shrine</ENAMEX> is uniquely renowned for its special role
        in preparing imperial princesses to serve as vestal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virgins</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Shrine of Ise, Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shinto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> has a prominent role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tale of Genji</ENAMEX> and in a famous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noh</ENAMEX> play (titled simply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonomiya</ENAMEX>), and thus attracts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with
        especial interest in classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> literature.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohara</ENAMEX>. Also north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> is the rural enclave of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohara</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to the magnificent temple complex of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanzen‚Äôin.</ENAMEX> From the bus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>, signs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> point the way to the path winding along a
        stream, past many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> and small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ohara‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pickles</ENAMEX>, to the temple‚Äôs massive front gate.
        The superbly landscaped Shuhekein pond garden is a
        legendary spot for meditation and contemplation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every season</TIMEX>. After
        the garden, venture into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> at the end of the corridor and try
        your hand with a calligraphy brush along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> visitors
        writing traditional prayers to the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amida Buddha</ENAMEX>. The view of
        the lush mossy landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> from the verandah at the back of the
        building is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ojo Gokurakuin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> at the
        temple‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> contains a magnificent seated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amida Buddha</ENAMEX> dating from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">986</NUMEX> (and so revered that no photography is permitted). The stamps at
        the various numbered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are particularly
        elegant and make a fine and unusual souvenir of your visit.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miho Museum</ENAMEX>. Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18.5 miles</NUMEX>) outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, set
        deep in a forested nature preserve, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miho Museum</ENAMEX>, designed by
        internationally acclaimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.M. Pei</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> leads to this

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> and, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> masterworks. The
        building‚Äôs exterior, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX> and exhibit displays are triumphs of
        design and harmony between old and new, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, simplicity and
        complexity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miho</ENAMEX> is not to be missed by anyone interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
        art and design, both ancient and modern.
        Fukui
        Just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fukui</ENAMEX>, a prefecture long renowned
        for its unique combination of history and superb natural scenery. For
        centuries it has been called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Echizen</ENAMEX> region, and that culturally
        significant name has definitely stuck. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Echizen</ENAMEX> coast includes
        famous columnar rock formations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tojimbo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sotomo</ENAMEX>, as well as some
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest beaches. Culinary delights include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echizen</ENAMEX> crab and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinctive Echizen</ENAMEX> soba. And the simple, natural style of Echizen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pottery</ENAMEX> has been popular throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>,
        as have Echizen‚Äôs highly regarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lacquerware</ENAMEX> and hand-crafted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">knives</ENAMEX>.
        Historical heritage is very much the theme at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ichidani</ENAMEX>.
        Preserved here is an entire <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th century</TIMEX> village that served as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asakura</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX>, which ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echizen</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1573</TIMEX>. The
        painstakingly recreated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> contain exhibits of the trades and
        crafts of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, including a dyer‚Äôs workshop, a merchant‚Äôs office,
        and samurai <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fukui‚</ENAMEX>Äôs far north, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Awara Onsen</ENAMEX> has become one of
        Japan‚Äôs most popular hot-spring resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> made it
        a hot spot for an imperial soak. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> expect the rustic quaintness
        of traditional-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Awara</ENAMEX> typically packs its heat-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> into
        modern, luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> whose harsh concrete exteriors hardly reflect the
        tranquilizing pleasures provided within.
        Nara
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> remains the country‚Äôs major cultural and
        historic destination, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> equally revere the Kansai
        region‚Äôs other celebrated historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Nara was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Japan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial</ENAMEX> capital, and it remains home to many of its most important
        temples, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, and collections of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> art treasures. For anyone
        interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> history, art, and culture, no visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
        could possibly be complete without a glimpse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX>, however
        frustratingly brief. And, in addition to its magnificent cultural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treasures</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX> offers the unlikely phenomenon of the world‚Äôs most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">aggressive deer</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kintetsu Station</ENAMEX> is the ideal starting point for any
        exploration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">station‚Äôs</ENAMEX> south entrance is an
        excellent tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. The friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> usually speak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">reasonable English</ENAMEX> and will happily ply you with maps and brochures,
        help you get oriented, and provide advice and information on festivals
        and special events.
        Next to the fountain outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kintetsu Station</ENAMEX> is bustling
        Higashi-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">muki</NUMEX>-dori, a covered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> of souvenirs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, antique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>,
        and numerous eateries. At the other end is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanjo-dori</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main
        shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, with more of the same plus calligraphy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> noted
        for their fine inkstones, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nara</ENAMEX> specialty.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nara Park</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt.</ENAMEX> Wakakusa
        The historic area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX> is on the east side of the
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sanjo</ENAMEX>-dori. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naramachi</ENAMEX> is a famous quarter
        filled with gorgeous historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, eclectic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>,
        and interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. Here too is the western entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nara Park</ENAMEX>,
        marking the boundary between urban sprawl and primal forest. The town‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> and a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> are all encompassed by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nara Park‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> are its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, protected
        since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX>, when they were considered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods</ENAMEX>. Despite being wild, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> are quite tame and loiter around the
        park‚Äôs various tourist attractions, hoping for a free snack of the deer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biscuits</ENAMEX> sold here. Have your camera ready to record the incredible
        sight of a wailing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> beating a hasty retreat to its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> after being chased by a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hungry deer</ENAMEX> in a feeding
        frenzy.
        At the edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarusawa</ENAMEX>-ike pond is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kofukuji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. Its

        including the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kasuga Grand Shrine</ENAMEX> at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Wakakusa</ENAMEX>, with
        which it has been closely associated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,100 years</TIMEX>. Kofukuji‚Äôs many
        surviving artworks and artifacts are housed in its newest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the

        its fascinating exhibits showcase the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>-influenced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> art and design. The gift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in the underpass between the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">buildings</ENAMEX> offers an excellent selection of quality souvenirs,
        reproductions, and posters of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nara</ENAMEX> culture.
        Also on the west side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nara Park</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todaiji</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">which‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇlike many elaborate temple complexes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcomprises many
        remarkable structures and artifacts. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is the majestic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nandaimon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great South Gate</ENAMEX>), standing over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> ft) high and
        dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1199</TIMEX>. Built in a classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> architectural style, this
        huge structure is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two-thirds</NUMEX> the size of the original destroyed by
        a typhoon in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">962</TIMEX>. The gate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Benevolent Kings</ENAMEX>, guardian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deities</ENAMEX> created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twelfth century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master sculptors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unkei</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaikei</ENAMEX> to guard the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple compound</ENAMEX>.
        Pass through the gate for your first view of the massive
        roof of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daibutsuden</ENAMEX> straight ahead. The current building, dating
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1709</TIMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two-thirds</NUMEX> the size of the original, which burned
        down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades earlier</TIMEX>. On the right of the door is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binzuru</ENAMEX>, a disciple
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gautama</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs original name before achieving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enlightenment</ENAMEX>). His statue is said to have special healing powers;
        sections of the statue shine with the polish of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thousands‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇif</ENAMEX> not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">millions‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇof</ENAMEX> hands rubbing away ailments over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.Finally,
        inside the massive hall, deep in meditation on a massive podium within
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> of giant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lotus leaves</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nara‚Äôs</ENAMEX> celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daibutsu</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">48.5 ft</NUMEX>) tall, the gigantic cast-bronze statue is
        shorter than the original unveiled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">752</TIMEX>, when it was covered in gold
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leaf</ENAMEX>. As with all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> images, the positions of the hands are highly
        significant. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs right hand is bestowing spiritual
        tranquillity, while the left symbolizes the granting of wishes. Seated
        on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nyorin Kannon</ENAMEX>, in whose hand is a jewel used to
        answer prayers and grant wishes; on the other is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kokuzo</ENAMEX>, who embodies
        wisdom and happiness.
        To the east is Nigatsu-do (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Month Hall</ENAMEX>), one of
        Todaiji‚Äôs most famous subtemples, whose front portion rests on a vast
        network of wooden beams. The covered northern staircase and the broad
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> southern staircase both lead up to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> encircling
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, which has massive lanterns and a strange assortment of
        artwork donated by supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Nigatsu-do hosts a spectacular
        fire purification festival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second month</TIMEX> of the lunar calendar
        (hence its name): the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O-mizu Torii</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Water-Drawing Festival</ENAMEX>. Every
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>, temple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests brandish</ENAMEX> long poles each with a
        flaming cedar ball at the end. They run along the front of the
        verandah, deliberately showering the large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> below with burning
        embers that are believed to bring good luck for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming year</TIMEX>,
        burning away transgressions from the previous one. In long-exposure
        photographs, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> appears to be on fire.
        Along the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Wakakusa</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kasuga Grand Shrine</ENAMEX>,
        established to house the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinto</ENAMEX> deities of the powerful Fujiwara
        family. It has been a place of worship for both emperors and
        aristocrats for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. The main approach from the east (from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kofukuji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>) is lined with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanterns set</ENAMEX> amid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">lush greenery.</ENAMEX> These are illuminated in dramatic crowd-drawing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ceremonies</ENAMEX> held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-August every year</TIMEX>. The
        shrine‚Äôs renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Treasure House</ENAMEX> is one of the newest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> here,
        with wooden plaques in the shape of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> paddles reflecting the
        importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Shinto‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX>, by definition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Japanese‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇculture</ENAMEX>.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>-planting ceremony is held in mid-March, during which the
        shrine‚Äôs sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> field is symbolically replanted.
        Outside Nara
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> and west of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX> is an ancient area called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nishinokyo</ENAMEX> (meaning ‚Äúwest of the capital‚Äù), where you will find three
        important temples.
        The sunset reflection of the twin pagodas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yakushiji</ENAMEX> in
        a nearby lake is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most striking and visually poetic
        images. Of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, only the To-to (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Pagoda</ENAMEX>)
        remains, considered by many to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pagoda</ENAMEX>.
        Although it appears to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> stories, the pagoda is actually a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, each level having an extra roof for added visual
        impact. The vermilion Sai-to (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Pagoda</ENAMEX>) was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> on the
        site of the long-destroyed original. Between them is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kondo</ENAMEX> (golden,
        or main, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>), reconstructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>. Among its many notable bronze
        images is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yakushi triad</ENAMEX>, comprising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> blackened-bronze images:
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yakushi Buddha</ENAMEX> (dedicated to healing and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>) seated on a
        medicine chest between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodhisattvas</ENAMEX> of the sun and moon.
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A ten-minute</TIMEX> walk to the north is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toshodaiji</ENAMEX>, which boasts
        rare examples of ancient architecture and sculpture. Less spectacular
        than its expensively restored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> to the south, Toshodaiji
        nevertheless is the largest remaining example of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX> period
        architecture. Of its numerous period sculptures, the most celebrated is
        a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.5</NUMEX>-ft) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX>-armed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kannon</ENAMEX> statue.
        Every culture has a single historical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, a visionary
        credited with planting the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> from which cultural, aesthetic, and
        ethical values flourished. For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is the revered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince</ENAMEX>
        Shotoku, early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX>. Not only did this highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progressive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs first written constitution and legal
        code, thus laying the foundations of an organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, he is also
        credited with having introduced the concept of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">wa (‚Äúharmony‚Äù</ENAMEX>) as the
        fundamental value shaping the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> character. His life and
        achievements are celebrated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horyuji</ENAMEX>, a large temple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern Nara</ENAMEX> comprising <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">forty buildings</ENAMEX> that became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Japan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX> World Heritage Site. Horyuji was actually built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Shotoku‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">622</TIMEX>. However, it stands on the site of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of
        Japan‚Äôs earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples, which he built.
        After entering through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nandaimon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great South Gate</ENAMEX>),
        walk down <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">another long</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">walkway</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chumon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Gate</ENAMEX>) and the
        inner temple grounds. Just past the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fearsome Guardian Kings</ENAMEX> on watch
        for intruding evil, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sai</ENAMEX>-in, the western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>. This contains
        Horyuji‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-storied pagoda and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kondo</ENAMEX> (main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>), built around
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">670</NUMEX> and the world‚Äôs oldest wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Within the To-in (eastern
        compound) is the octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yumedono</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hall of Dreams</ENAMEX>), whose exquisite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guze Kannon</ENAMEX> statue was considered so sacred that it was completely
        hidden from human eyes from its dedication in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">737</NUMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX>, when it
        was unwrapped by a visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> art scholar‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwith the Meiji
        government‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX>, of course.
        Also in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daihozoden</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treasure Hall</ENAMEX>), housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horyuji‚</ENAMEX>Äôs magnificent collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        art, among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest. Included are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 10,000</NUMEX> items, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,780</NUMEX> of
        which are classified as national treasures or important cultural
        assets. Highlights include <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an Indian</TIMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaka triad</ENAMEX>; the Yumechigae
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(‚ÄúDream Changing‚Äù</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kannon</ENAMEX>, said to transform its worshippers‚Äô
        nightmares into pleasant dreams; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kudara Kannon</ENAMEX>, a graceful,
        willowy statue named after a region in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">creator</ENAMEX> was almost certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX>. Horyuji was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>
        imported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> bears much of their distinctive
        artistic stamp.
        Surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horyuji</ENAMEX> also contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> dedicated
        to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigner</ENAMEX>: Langdon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> whom the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have mistakenly credited with saving both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> from
        aerial bombing during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. The decision to spare them was
        actually taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Stimson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX>, who knew the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> from his own pre-war visits.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osaka</ENAMEX>
        More than just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> second <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> is also the
        perfect base from which to explore nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nara</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>.
        Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> is overshadowed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> in the big-city stakes, it is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vibrant</ENAMEX> and energetic world capital in its own right and certainly has
        plenty to offer the curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>.
        Indeed, for many visitors <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> is more truly ‚ÄúJapanese‚Äù
        than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, having a more distinctive flavor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> than its
        sprawling rival to the east. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osakans</ENAMEX> pride themselves on being warmer,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friendlier</ENAMEX>, and more spontaneous than their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX>, whom they
        love to dismiss as formal and uptight. They are also renowned
        throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things: doing business and eating.
        Here, business and pleasure are inextricably linked‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand
        have been for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. The city‚Äôs commercial reputation
        reflects its origins as the national merchants‚Äô capital and a major
        trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hideyoshi</ENAMEX> built his main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> in the center of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> after unifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1583</TIMEX>, the city‚Äôs prosperity seemed
        written in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. With an uninhibited merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> eager to throw its
        newly acquired wealth around, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> quickly became <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs undisputed
        entertainment and theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
        Despite the economic slowdown and recession of the 1990s
        that followed the bursting of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> economic bubble, anyone strolling
        around central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous nighttime entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> will
        quickly realize how much its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> love to eat, drink, and party.
        In fact, so dedicated are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osakans</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of eating that they are
        known for kuidare (eating until you drop or until you go bankrupt,
        depending on the interpretation).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> will win no urban beauty contests, but there are
        plenty of sights to see here, including a couple of interesting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">museums</ENAMEX>, a remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, and an underground shopping complex
        that might be the world‚Äôs largest.
        The best way to see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> is by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>. Taxis are
        expensive and vulnerable to the city‚Äôs sticky traffic situation; and
        information on the tourist-unfriendly bus service is almost entirely in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> only. An <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all-day</TIMEX> subway pass (available at any ticket machine)
        costs the equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than four</NUMEX> central-area subway tickets
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about US$7</NUMEX>).
        A good place to start exploring is the bustling Umeda
        area, containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Railways Osaka Station</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway stations</ENAMEX>. It also has most famous department
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, the gigantic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hankyu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hanshin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> (whose
        private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX> serve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Tourist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Office</ENAMEX> is just inside the main entrance to the Hankyu
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umeda</ENAMEX> marks the northern end of the business and entertainment
        district popularly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kita</ENAMEX> (meaning simply ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù), and is the
        very essence of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs hustle and bustle.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umeda‚</ENAMEX>Äôs teeming subway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> rival the
        crowd scenes for which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> is so notorious. Equally
        impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> scenes occur below <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umeda</ENAMEX> in a mammoth network of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and cozy inexpensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> whose scale boggles the
        mind. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> of every large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one-mile</NUMEX> radius is
        linked to form a modern commercial labyrinth. It actually comprises
        several shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> seamlessly interconnected to ensure maximum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> and cash turnover. To explore its fascinating subterranean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sights</ENAMEX>, start with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúWhity Umeda,‚Äù</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hankyu and Hanshin</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, then move on to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúHerbis Plaza‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> expect to see
        daylight again for some time.
        A suitable cure for your extended period underground is to
        go up‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ40</NUMEX> stories up to the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shin-Umeda Sky Building</ENAMEX>. This
        futuristic and unusual structure is actually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> glass-and-steel towers
        linked at the top, from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúFloating Observatory‚Äù</ENAMEX> provides a
        panoramic view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the surrounding countryside.
        Shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> are a staple feature of every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and village. Unsurprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> boasts some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        most impressive‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇor excessive, depending on your taste. You can spend
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fascinating hours</TIMEX> exploring the covered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hankyu Higashi</ENAMEX>-dori arcade near
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hankyu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, less upmarket but no less fascinating than the
        more famous Shinsaibashi arcade (see below). In the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kita</ENAMEX>,
        across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Consulate</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kita Shinchi, Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs premiere dining
        and entertainment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, centered around the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of Shinchi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hondori</ENAMEX>. This area is great for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>-watching, but to eat here it
        helps to have a generous expense account.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mint</ENAMEX> is situated on the west <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dojima River</ENAMEX>
        (opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sakuranomiya Park</ENAMEX>). Although its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has a large
        exhibition of the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> and foreign money, it is best
        known for its long avenue of magnificent late-blooming cherry <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
        the city‚Äôs finest.
        Just to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sakuranomiya Park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujita Art</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>, which has a fine collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> paintings
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the 11th century</TIMEX> to the present. If you‚Äôve become an adept of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony, you‚Äôll appreciate the excellent collection of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>: ceramic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> bowls, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea kettles</ENAMEX>, and caddies, as
        well as bamboo spoons, whisks, and flower vases.
        For more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, stop in at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Oriental</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX>, located in the garden at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nakanoshima</ENAMEX>, the ‚Äúcentral
        island‚Äù in the middle of the large river running through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. Here you can find fine specimens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> that so strongly influenced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs own styles. Most of
        Osaka‚Äôs municipal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nakanoshima</ENAMEX>, including an elegant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style town hall dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX>, one of the few red-brick
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
        Here you‚Äôll also get a splendid view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX>,
        which is dramatically illuminated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. To celebrate his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unification of Japan</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a century</TIMEX> of civil war, Hideyoshi
        had made the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> the country‚Äôs greatest fortress, so the Tokugawa
        felt obliged to destroy it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1615</TIMEX> after snatching power away from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hideyoshi‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX>. They later rebuilt it to bolster their own prestige,
        only to burn it down once again in a fit of pique when the Meiji
        Restoration of imperial power abolished their shogunate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>. Today,
        a reinforced-concrete replica reproduces only the great <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-storied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">42 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">138 ft</ENAMEX>) high, surrounded by moats and ivy-covered
        ramparts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> contains an interesting but disappointingly modern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> displaying armor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, costumes, and historical documents.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also an enchanting collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bunraku puppets‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> rare
        chance to see them at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close</NUMEX> range.
        Providing a welcome touch of green amid all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asphalt</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ginkgo</ENAMEX> and sycamore <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> line the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Midosuji Boulevard</ENAMEX>. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> runs south from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umeda</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kita‚Äôs southern</ENAMEX> counterpart,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minami</ENAMEX>. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midosuji</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>-mura, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> posing
        ground for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs desperately trendy youth, so named for the large
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> selling much-sought-after secondhand apparel imported
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midosuji</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous Shinsaibashi
        shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arcade</ENAMEX>, a consumer-frenzy mecca <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> in national status only
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinjuku</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. If you have time for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>
        walk in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX>, this is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arcade</ENAMEX> begins over a mile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX>, start from exit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinsaibashi Station</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midosuji</ENAMEX> subway
        line, between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sogo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimaru</ENAMEX> department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, and turn right to
        make your way south.
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every night</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>, this entire area is teeming with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman frequenting</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hostess bars</ENAMEX>, and private drinking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clubs</ENAMEX>. (Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> are confusingly called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúsnack bars</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù But
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists beware</ENAMEX>! These bizarre <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> are the true home of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20</NUMEX> glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, with prices aimed squarely at lonely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> with
        expense accounts looking for a home away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. )
        This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs trendy youth prowl for action, as do
        many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs growing pack of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign residents</ENAMEX> seduced by the
        lure of easy yen. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> and evenings, the place is a
        teeming throng of humanity. Wandering the side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> allows
        you to soak up the heady atmosphere of pleasure and commerce that has
        characterized this part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.
        At the far south is the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ebisu Bridge</ENAMEX>, a favorite
        meeting place for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs trendiest young things. Just before you cross
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, on your left is an arch announcing the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soemon-cho</ENAMEX>,
        a colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of late-night <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and night <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> that is
        Minami‚Äôs answer to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kita-Shinchi</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Umeda</ENAMEX>. Note the ultra-modern
        black-and-chrome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirin Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> next to the entrance to bustling
        Soemon-cho.
        As you cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, stop in the middle to immerse
        yourself in the sights and sounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, the blazing neon, and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dotomburi River</ENAMEX> below you. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs heyday
        as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">country‚Äôs theater</ENAMEX> and entertainment capital, the biggest stars
        would arrive by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to enter the riverside back entrances of the many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">theaters on Dotomburi</ENAMEX>, which is just south of the river. Frenzied fans
        would pack this very bridge for a glimpse of their idols arriving in
        ornate medieval waterborne equivalents of the modern stretch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limousine</ENAMEX>.
        Turning left on the other side of the bridge brings you to
        Dotomburi, which at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ultimate assault on the senses. A
        cornucopia of bizarre creatures adorn the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> flanking this
        pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>: giant monsters slither down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, cinemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>, games centers, and steamy noodle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>.
        No photograph can capture the intensity of this strange and
        unforgettable concourse.
        At the other end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dotomburi</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nipponbashi</ENAMEX> area.
        This is where you will find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Den-Den</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sadly underwhelming
        answer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo‚Äôs Akihabara</ENAMEX> electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nipponbashi</ENAMEX> is also
        famous as the national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of bunraku, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dazzling traditional
        puppet theater. Although various forms of puppet theater date back to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>, the remarkably expressive and elaborately costumed
        bunraku style was thriving by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>.
        Although its popularity waned during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Meiji</ENAMEX> period, it has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúrediscovered‚Äù</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this century</TIMEX>, the most dramatic evidence being the vast
        investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bunraku Theater</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nipponbashi</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bunraku</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> performance art of surprising
        dramatic intensity, worth seeing if only for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> or so in the
        middle of a busy day of sightseeing. Although all dialog and narration
        are in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> interpretation device or an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> program
        is always available. Many of the most popular heroic and tragic dramas
        were written by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs own <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monzaemon Chikamatsu</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1653‚Äì1724</ENAMEX>), the
        playwright the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> claim as their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>.
        In the neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shin-Kabuki</ENAMEX>-za
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater</ENAMEX> (at the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Midosuji Boulevard</ENAMEX>) gives kabuki performances
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only three weeks each year</TIMEX>. But there‚Äôs plenty of other traditional
        drama such as kyogen farces and manzai comic double-acts. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Osaka International Festival</ENAMEX> of drama and music takes place both at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Festival Hall</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nakanoshima Island</ENAMEX>. Even if you
        don‚Äôt bother venturing within, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> itself is dramatic and
        should not be missed.
        Between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nipponbashi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Namba</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>, try to find
        nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Doguya-suji</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(‚ÄúKitchen Street‚Äù</ENAMEX>), a narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> of restaurant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wholesalers</ENAMEX>. This is the place to buy souvenirs of all the imitation
        food you‚Äôve seen in restaurant windows, together with Japanese-style
        plates, bowls, glasses, sake sets, lacquerware, giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> lanterns,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> other things you never expected to see for sale.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of Namba</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebisucho</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennoji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tsutenkaku Tower</ENAMEX>, a rather desperate imitation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX>
        (and perhaps the only structure that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kyoto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> look
        impressive). The view from the observation deck <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 300 ft up</NUMEX> is
        panoramic but hardly worth the effort.
        The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Municipal Art Museum</ENAMEX>, near Tennoji
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Station</ENAMEX>, is worth visiting for its celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abe Collection</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> paintings (ninth‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì13th centuries</TIMEX>) and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX>- and
        Ching-dynasty <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">14th‚</ENAMEX>Äì19th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>). The large permanent
        encampment of homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennoji Park</ENAMEX> makes the area more
        than a little seedy (but not at all dangerous).
        Close by is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shitennoji</ENAMEX>,
        founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">593</TIMEX> by the revered reforming lawgiver, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shotoku</ENAMEX>.
        Unfortunately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in this large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> are concrete
        reproductions of the originals destroyed by bombing in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II.
        However, the large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone torii gateway</ENAMEX> is the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, dating
        back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1294</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shitennoji</ENAMEX> also hosts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple market</ENAMEX> on
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">21st</NUMEX> of each month, featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">antiques</ENAMEX>, used clothing, and
        miscellaneous items.
        Farther south is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sumiyoshi Taisha</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, dedicated to
        the god of peace, song, and seafaring. The shrine‚Äôs large and
        attractive arched <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> is just one of the features enjoyed by the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who come to make prayer offerings on the first
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days of the New Year</TIMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is thought to have been
        founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX>, the present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are relatively
        recent reproductions.
        Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka Port</ENAMEX> at the far west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> offers <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> distractions for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. The futuristic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiyukan Aquarium</ENAMEX>
        has at its core one of the world‚Äôs largest indoor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX>, containing a
        dramatic collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX> and other large deep-sea <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>. Arranged
        in a descending spiral around it are other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanks</ENAMEX> representing the
        denizens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ocean‚Äôs seismic ‚Äúring</ENAMEX> of fire. ‚Äù
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX> is set in a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of unusual shops
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that also contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suntory Museum</ENAMEX>. In addition to
        regular art exhibitions, this wildly abstract structure features
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osaka‚Äôs IMAX</ENAMEX> wide-screen theater. The entire area makes for a great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">afternoon‚Äôs</ENAMEX> break from the pressures of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> sightseeing.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX> exploded onto the world‚Äôs headlines with the
        suddenness of the earthquake that ravaged the city <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 January 1995</TIMEX>,
        claiming a final death toll of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 6,000</NUMEX>. But a combination of
        remarkable communal solidarity and determination coupled with extensive
        private- and public-sector investment lie behind a recovery that is
        nothing short of astonishing.
        Hemmed into a narrow coastal strip between the Rokko
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mountains</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland Sea</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port city</ENAMEX> came into its own after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> pressure forced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to open to foreign trade in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> who established a foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX> included large numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is still known within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for
        its small but highly visible foreign business community, some of whose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX> home for generations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX> is a major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> with thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, and nightlife, not
        to mention Nankin-machi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">‚ÄúChinatown</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        One early influence of the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> was the
        development of the nationally famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that had
        never touched the stuff until foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barbarians</ENAMEX> began demanding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX>. Although meat eating is now considered commonplace, it is still
        strongly associated with the cosmopolitan, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">‚ÄúWestern‚Äù</ENAMEX> lifestyle that has
        such all-pervasive appeal in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> society. Raised nearby in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tajima</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tamba</ENAMEX>, the cattle produce a uniquely <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty meat</ENAMEX>, with a
        special flavor said to come from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> dose of strong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>. The price
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tor Road</ENAMEX> is exorbitant, but you might like to try
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> either grilled straight or prepared Japanese-style as sashimi
        (raw), sukiyaki (thinly sliced and pan-fried), or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">shabu-shabu</NUMEX> (stewed
        in a hot-pot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX>).
        Kobe‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main downtown shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> are Sannomiya
        and neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Motomachi</ENAMEX>, both featuring large department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and
        fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>. Numerous smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are in the Kokashita
        arcade, a long but narrow covered shopping passage beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JR</ENAMEX>
        tracks that is definitely not for the claustrophobic.
        Kobe‚Äôs biggest tourist draw, though, is mainly of interest
        to domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Kitano, the old foreign merchants‚Äô
        residential district, preserves some of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that survived <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. For foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, the most
        interesting thing about this area will probably be witnessing the
        fascination these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> hold over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Kitano‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX> add to the exotic appeal of this
        unusual area.
        Dominating the mountain range that provides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        dramatic backdrop is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Rokko</ENAMEX>, which offers a wide range of natural
        and man-made attractions To escape the stifling heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>,
        everyone except the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-</ENAMEX>fit takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the ten-minute</TIMEX> cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">car</ENAMEX> ride to
        the top. Here you will discover a commanding view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX>, Awaji
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland Sea</ENAMEX>. The many hiking and cycling trails draw
        nature-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>.
        Behind <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Rokko</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arima Onsen</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest
        hot-spring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. Like popular hot-spring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
        this small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has been the site of furious development, and the many
        small traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> (ryokan) and bathhouses are now dwarfed by
        large, ugly concrete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arima Onsen</ENAMEX> still offers an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> introduction to the pleasures of bathing Japanese-style, whether
        through a visit of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> to one of the large and luxuriously
        equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, or a night spent in a traditional family-run
        hot-spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inn</ENAMEX>.
        Ise-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shima</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ise-Shima National Park</ENAMEX>, southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX>, is home to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Outer and Inner shrines of Ise</ENAMEX>. These deceptively simple structures
        are no less than the sacred repository of the national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">identity‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇShinto sanctuaries</ENAMEX> dedicated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 2,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> to
        Japan‚Äôs founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deities</ENAMEX>. Their atmospheric setting in serene woodland
        reveals more strongly than anywhere else the profound links between
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and its mythical origins. Be forewarned: for foreign
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ise</ENAMEX> is not a destination for picturesque sightseeing, and
        there isn‚Äôt really very much to see or photograph (especially since
        taking pictures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner Shrine</ENAMEX> is forbidden). Rather, it provides
        an opportunity to glimpse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key aspect of the very essence of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose origins, development, and identity hold a
        fascination for the rest of the world.
        While no more nor less significant than other countries‚Äô
        national symbols and icons, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Shinto</ENAMEX> identity embodied in the shrines
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ise</ENAMEX> is quite distinct from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs other man-made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
        Nature itself is the primal essence enshrined and worshipped at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ise</ENAMEX>, as
        implied by the carefully orchestrated approach to the sanctuaries past
        the limpid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu River</ENAMEX> and through the forest. Although the sacred
        structures represent the ultimate focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinto</ENAMEX> religion, they
        are dismantled and renewed every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">years‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇone</ENAMEX> of the most explicit
        manifestations of the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> belief in transience and
        perpetual renewal.
        Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Outer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> comprise a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">treasure houses</ENAMEX>, each enclosed within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four fences</TIMEX>. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
        the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> are allowed past the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fences. This restriction reinforces the notion of
        the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">descendents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇdespite the emperor‚Äôs renunciation of divinity announced as one
        of the terms of surrender at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> (when some people
        literally fainted upon hearing the emperor‚Äôs voice on the radio for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time). Indeed, so sacred are the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> that, despite the
        relatively peaceful coexistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> monks and nuns were banned from entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">precincts</ENAMEX> prior
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiji Restoration</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> are most easily reached from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX> via the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kintetsu Railway</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Uji-Yamada Station</ENAMEX>. In addition to the famo us
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrines</ENAMEX>, you can explore more of this attractively scenic peninsula,
        with its national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, the haunting image of the sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwedded rocks‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Futamigaura</ENAMEX> beach, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kashikojima</ENAMEX> at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kintetsu railway‚Äôs Shima</ENAMEX> line.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer Shrine</ENAMEX>
        A short walk from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Uji-Yamada Station</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geku</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrine</ENAMEX>. It is dedicated to the God of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, who was sent down to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Goddess Amaterasu</ENAMEX>. Originally situated near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">present-day Kyoto</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> was moved here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">478</TIMEX>. The main entrance
        takes you to the first sacred gateway (torii), which in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> always
        symbolizes the threshold of holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground</ENAMEX>. Both shrines‚Äô surprisingly
        primitive design is thought to be based on those of granaries and
        storehouses from prehistoric times.
        As you walk along the avenue of pines and giant cedars,
        you pass on the right the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anzaisho</ENAMEX>, the emperor‚Äôs rest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and
        Sanshujo, the rest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Beyond a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> torii
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaguraden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of the Sacred Dances</ENAMEX>. In return for a donation
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine maidens</ENAMEX> (miko), dressed in the typically
        Shinto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX> of bright-red pleated skirts with white blouses, will
        perform one of the dances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> wield <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the holy sakaki
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and dance to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestra</ENAMEX> composed of wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clappers</ENAMEX> (hyoshigi),
        plucked zither (koto), mouth organ (sho), and the oboe-like hichiriki,
        together with flute and drum.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> ends at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geku‚Äôs Shoden</ENAMEX> (main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>
        building), <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">which‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtogether</ENAMEX> with its eastern and western treasure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">houses‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis</ENAMEX> enclosed by a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> unvarnished wooden fences.
        This is where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Shinto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> in white robes with black belts and black
        lacquered clogs stand to bless worshippers as they make a silent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obeisance</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shoden</ENAMEX> itself is just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ft) high, a little less in
        width, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ft) long.
        Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is constructed of plain, unadorned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cypress wood</ENAMEX>, brought especially from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kiso Mountains</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alps</ENAMEX>, northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX>. The style of the cross-beamed roofs and
        simple wooden frames is the same as that used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 2,000</NUMEX> years
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>, before <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> architecture exerted its influence when Buddhism
        arrived here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>. This is a special style of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Shinto</ENAMEX> architecture
        that is prohibited from being used at other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Geku-Jin-en Sacred Park</ENAMEX>, at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Takakura</ENAMEX>,
        is an integral part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> and a beautiful place for a quiet
        stroll. In fact, if you don‚Äôt feel like taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>, the walk to the
        inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> takes you along a delightful tree-shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> lined with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> lanterns.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inner Shrine</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naiku</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inner Shrine</ENAMEX>) is the more important of the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrines</ENAMEX>, as it is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amaterasu</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Goddess</ENAMEX> and supreme
        deity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinto</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naiku</ENAMEX> holds the sacred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-pointed mirror
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">yata</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no</NUMEX>-kagami), which is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> symbols of the imperial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">throne</ENAMEX>. (The others are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX>, which resides at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atsuta Shrine</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX>, and the jewel, kept in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. ) The
        Naiku‚Äôs layout and the construction of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shoden</ENAMEX> are similar to those
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geku</ENAMEX>, although the approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naiku</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uji Bridge</ENAMEX>
        across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu River</ENAMEX> is more picturesque. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, the
        bridge is renewed every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX>.
        The ritual dismantling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> every 20 years
        (known as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sengu-shiki</ENAMEX>) goes back to prehistoric times, when sacred
        structures tended to be erected for special ceremonies rather than as
        permanent places of worship. You will notice beside each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> an area
        of open ground on which the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is to be erected‚<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin 2013‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin</ENAMEX>
        identical form. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> are broken up into small pieces and
        distributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> as talismans. The whole process is both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">painstaking</ENAMEX> and expensive, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the imperial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> renounced his divinity means the shrines
        (rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>) must now foot the bill. To defray costs,
        worshippers must make a generous donation to receive a piece of the old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX>.
        You can join the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> down at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isuzu</ENAMEX>
        River, where they perform a rite of purification by washing their
        mouths with its clear, fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>. At the same time, they play with
        the fat red, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, and black carp swimming around nearby.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wakayama</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of Osaka</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wakayama</ENAMEX>, a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">prefecture</ENAMEX> whose long
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coastline</ENAMEX> and lush greenery have long been a magnet for domestic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. In addition to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of temples</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, and hot-spring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wakayama</ENAMEX> features some of the country‚Äôs most popular
        beaches.
        Farther south is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koyasan</ENAMEX>, the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shingon</ENAMEX> branch
        of esoteric <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddhism</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important religious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enclaves</ENAMEX>. Now comprising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple buildings</ENAMEX> as well as numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrines</ENAMEX>, pagodas, and stupas, this large religious settlement is
        located at the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Koya</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,006-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,300</NUMEX>-ft) peak. Koyasan was
        already known as a sacred site for ascetic practices when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kobo Daishi</ENAMEX>,
        a revered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX>, received imperial
        permission to establish a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> to develop his new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shingon</ENAMEX> sect in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">816</NUMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> of the kukai (‚Äúgreat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as he is
        known) is located at the deepest reaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okunoin, Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most
        famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koyasan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest draws. Once the kukai was
        buried there, the great and the humble alike were quick to see the
        merit of a final resting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> near the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>. The graves of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> from all walks of life now occupy the site, with
        the remains of emperors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>, samurai, and poets all
        jostling for space. Their tombs and stone markers range from the
        ostentatious to the elegant, the well preserved to the decrepit.
        Well <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a million</NUMEX> ancestor-worshipping <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> descend
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koyasan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Okunoin</ENAMEX> on major public holidays, especially those
        commemorating the dead. If you are wise enough to avoid these times,
        consider spending <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple lodgings</ENAMEX> (shukubo)
        that offer surprisingly comfortable traditional accommodation to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>. The main highlight of a stay at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these
        special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> is the chance to sample the luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">vegetarian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> cuisine (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">shojin-ryori</NUMEX>) served only in such <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lodgings</ENAMEX>.
        The path to enlightenment can indeed be surprisingly pleasurable.

        stretches northeast from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansai</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hida, Kiso</ENAMEX>, and Akaishi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountains‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇknown</ENAMEX> collectively as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Alps‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇto the plains of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX> coast and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Japan</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs most easily explored in an
        excursion from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansai</ENAMEX> region by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> in a picturesque
        mountain-railroad journey from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX>. You can visit the charming town
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takayama</ENAMEX>, set in the midst of imposing mountain scenery, and the
        historical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanazawa</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Takayama</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takayama</ENAMEX>-line train, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gifu</ENAMEX>, takes you
        along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiso</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river valleys</ENAMEX>. The leisurely <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three-hour</TIMEX> ride
        passes through steep gorges, narrow terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice paddies</ENAMEX>, and neatly
        tailored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> hugging the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> with not a square
        inch of usable land wasted. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> stops by riverside markets where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and gossip with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takayama</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> famous for its carpenters‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa
        reputation going back to the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> of Nara
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>. With the harvests of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hida</ENAMEX> mountain district too meager
        to contribute taxes to the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> sent instead its
        skillful artisans (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hida</ENAMEX> no takumi) to help build the temples and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">palaces</ENAMEX> of the imperial capital. Those skills have been handed down to
        present-day <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> working in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yew wood</ENAMEX>, and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">timbered</ENAMEX> houses
        are exquisitely maintained in traditional style. The local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lord</ENAMEX> in turn
        borrowed the capital‚Äôs grid pattern when laying out medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takayama</ENAMEX>,
        which became known as ‚ÄúLittle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX> offers some of the most splendid traditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inns</ENAMEX> (ryokan), so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takayama</ENAMEX> is a good place to try out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>-style
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guesthouses</ENAMEX> (minshuku; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">229</NUMEX>)‚<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthey‚Äôre</ENAMEX> especially friendly
        here. All you need to get around are your own <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two feet</NUMEX>, although
        renting a bicycle at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX> will give you easy access to
        the surrounding countryside.
        Start your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> at the open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asaichi</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> market down
        on the east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miya River</ENAMEX>, north of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yasugawa Street bridge</ENAMEX>.
        Savor the clear mountain air as you enjoy the display of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and nuts brought down from
        the hills.
        A little way back from the river, heading south, you‚Äôll
        find the delightful old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and workshops of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kami-Sannomachi</ENAMEX> and
        Furuimachinami <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. The high-quality <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">craftwork here‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwoodcarvings</ENAMEX>,
        lacquerware, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pottery‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis renowned</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. Furuimachinami
        is quieter and more residential, with long, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story, unpainted dark
        timber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, lattice fa√ßades, and low-balconied verandahs, plus a few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> in pots or hako-niwa box gardens to add some color.
        Some of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have been redeveloped as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and eclectic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">galleries</ENAMEX>.
        Just east of the riverside market are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> merchants‚Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yoshijima</ENAMEX>-ke and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kusakabe Mingeikan</ENAMEX>, the latter turned into a
        superb folkcraft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displaying local costumes, woodcarvings, and
        the fine, transparent lacquerware (shunkeinuri) that highlights rather
        than conceals the grain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>.
        Takayama‚Äôs most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kokubunji</ENAMEX>. Next to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pagoda</ENAMEX> is a ginkgo <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> said to be
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years old</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shiroyama Park</ENAMEX>, whose
        unlandscaped slopes covered with wildflowers have a pleasantly natural
        look and offer an extensive panorama of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan Alps</ENAMEX>
        beyond.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hida Minzoku-Mura</ENAMEX> is a fascinating open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of
        authentic old farmhouses from the region, most of them rescued from an
        area flooded by nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mihoro Dam</ENAMEX>. Laid out in an attractive hillside
        setting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a mile southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Takayama Station</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">houses‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmany</ENAMEX> of
        them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> stories high, with steeply pitched grass-thatch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">roofs‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare</ENAMEX> oddly reminiscent of those in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European Alpine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. The
        houses display old farm tools and cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">utensils</ENAMEX>, and some operate as
        workshops where you can watch the much-vaunted local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>
        demonstrating their skills in lacquerwork, carving, weaving, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dyeing</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hikers</ENAMEX> and mountain climbers won‚Äôt want to miss the bus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excursion</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">95 minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takayama</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nori-kura</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,026-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,928</NUMEX>-ft)
        volcano at the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan Alps National Park</ENAMEX>. For the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hikers</ENAMEX>, a bus goes to a point quite close to the summit, after which
        it‚Äôs an easy but exhilarating walk to the top.
        Kanazawa
        The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chubu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanazawa</ENAMEX> has been able
        to preserve its older charms from the assaults of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shoguns
        and the bombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> by pursuing a peaceful career of arts,
        crafts, and scholarship. It is home to a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> as well as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arts</ENAMEX> and crafts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanazawa</ENAMEX> is still considered an archetypal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> now occupies the spot once
        dominated by the long-destroyed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>. Still, there are some very
        pleasant walks around what are still referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>
        grounds.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kenrokuen Park</ENAMEX>, a classical Edo-period ‚Äústrolling‚Äù garden
        regarded as one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> best in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, is a good place to start
        your visit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> has a plethora of ponds spanned by elegant stone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bridges</ENAMEX>, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone lanterns</ENAMEX>, waterfalls, serpentine streams,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cherry trees</ENAMEX>, and pines. Artfully constructed hillocks provide
        panoramic views of the landscaping. The central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kasumigaike</ENAMEX> (Misty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake</ENAMEX>) is the most attractive of the ponds, graced by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tortoise Shell</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Island‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> tortoise being much favored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> as a symbol of
        long life.
        Among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kanazawa‚</ENAMEX>Äôs other specialties is its pretty,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-color glazed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">kutani</ENAMEX> pottery, which you‚Äôll see in many downtown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. If you‚Äôre interested enough to make a small investment, first
        look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marvelous samples</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Municipal Art Museum</ENAMEX> in the park
        before buying.
        West of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nagamachi</ENAMEX>, the old samurai <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>.
        Wander freely along the secluded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> past the dark timbered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>,
        all situated in very narrow, zigzagging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to hamper enemy attack.
        The superb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saihitsu</ENAMEX>-an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> features silk-dyers creating unbelievably
        expensive material for kimono.
        On the eastern edge of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Umeno</ENAMEX> Hashi
        bridge across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asano River</ENAMEX>, is the old geisha district, slightly
        more rundown than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagamachi</ENAMEX> but no less quaint.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Honshu</ENAMEX> and Shikoku
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland Sea</ENAMEX> offers a wide range of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attractions</ENAMEX>, from the varied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and cities of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honshu</ENAMEX> to the
        major pilgrimage destination of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shikoku</ENAMEX> island.
        Himeji
        Himeji‚Äôs magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> is unquestionably one of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">region‚Äôs ‚Äúmust-do‚</ENAMEX>Äù sights. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs only surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> preserved
        in its original form, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himeji Castle</ENAMEX> has opulent white walls and myriad
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">turrets</ENAMEX>. These have earned it the nickname <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shirasagi (‚ÄúWhite Heron</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle‚Äù</ENAMEX>) for the way its swooping, white-gabled profile proudly soars
        above this small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1600s</TIMEX>. When the
        famous unifiers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobunaga, Hideyoshi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> fought to end the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> civil wars, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hideyoshi</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Himeji</ENAMEX> as a base of operations
        against the recalcitrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX> of Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honshu</ENAMEX>. Although much of
        the castle‚Äôs interior seems dark and austere, this highlights the
        magnificent wood floors and paneling and the superb joinery and
        construction techniques.
        A special combination ticket is available for both Himeji
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX> and nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Koko</ENAMEX>-en, a superb landscaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> by
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master gardener</ENAMEX> on the site of a former samurai
        residence. Koko-en actually comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> distinct gardens, each with
        a special theme such as bamboo, pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, seedlings, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony garden, carefully designed to
        be appreciated from the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Urasenke</ENAMEX>-style teahouse, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> (and especially foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>) are invited to relax on
        tatami mats and enjoy a bowl of strong green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and a sweet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ceremoniously</ENAMEX> served by elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kimono-</ENAMEX>clad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>.
        (When served your bowl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>, don‚Äôt forget to bow slowly and turn the
        tea bowl <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times before sipping the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">frothy brew</ENAMEX>. )
        Kurashiki
        Surrounded by heavily industrialized suburbs, the old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center of Kurashiki</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> lined with dreamy willow trees‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa
        reverse comment on the horrors of war. This is practically the only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> of any consequence here along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inland Sea</ENAMEX> coast to have emerged
        unscathed from the terrible fire-bombings of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>. It thus provides an
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-too-rare glimpse of provincial life in prewar <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
        In the era of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shoguns, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> were used
        to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX> for onward shipment to the great
        markets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edo</ENAMEX>. The elegant black-brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">granaries</ENAMEX> have been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beautifully</ENAMEX> preserved to house the town‚Äôs many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> of art,
        folkcrafts, and archeology. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> certainly find a day‚Äôs visit to
        Kurashiki a very welcome change from the relentless modernity of some
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> nearby.
        Take a short taxi ride from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        district, then do the rest on foot. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>
        tucked into an elbow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>, but not all of them are worth
        seeing. Be sure to note down the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> names of the better ones
        before setting out.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most delightful is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurashiki Mingeikan</ENAMEX> folk
        art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, displaying not only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> pottery,
        glassware, textiles, and bamboo-ware, but also <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Native American</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasant</ENAMEX> ceramics and basketry with which to compare the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
        art. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohara Tokikan</ENAMEX> pottery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> is devoted to the work of modern
        pottery masters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanjiro Kawai, Shoji Hamada</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenkichi Tomimoto</ENAMEX>, as
        well as their much admired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Leach</ENAMEX>, the influential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British potter</ENAMEX> credited with popularizing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> rustic ceramic
        styles and techniques abroad.
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kurashiki Bijutsukan</ENAMEX> municipal art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the
        outside world is very much the focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninagawa</ENAMEX> family‚Äôs
        collection of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> ceramics,
        sculp ture, and mosaics, plus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> marble
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> sculptures. There is also some astonishing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rococo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Meissen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√®vres.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find a completely

        If you‚Äôve become an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiast</ENAMEX> of large ‚Äústrolling‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korakuen</ENAMEX>, in the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okayama</ENAMEX>, is
        considered a must by connoisseurs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have adopted the
        traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> practice of ranking sights and places, and Korakuen
        is ‚Äúofficially‚Äù one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> greatest gardens. At the garden‚Äôs
        famous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea pavilion</ENAMEX> you can sample a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony while contemplating

        maples on the other in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>.
        Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asahi River</ENAMEX>, you can see the ruins of Okayama
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX>, unusually painted black and called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ujo (‚ÄúThe Crow‚Äù</ENAMEX>) in

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Station</ENAMEX> might well be surprise. After all, the very name ‚ÄúHiroshima‚Äù
        has become a modern metaphor, the ultimate symbol of total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obliteration</ENAMEX>. Yet around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> you see <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower blocks</ENAMEX>, neon signs,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> zipping along the highway‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇall the signs of a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. In
        fact, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of broad avenues, green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>, which is more than double its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        You might find yourself looking at an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>,
        guessing how old they were on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 August 1945</TIMEX> and trying to imagine what
        they were doing at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:15am</TIMEX>, the instant of the atomic explosion that
        reverberated around the world. The movingly simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Memorial</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> documents the horror with charts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, photographs, videos,
        everyday objects transformed by the unimaginable heat of the blast, and
        a life-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diorama</ENAMEX> portraying horribly burned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the
        most powerful exhibits is a single photograph: a human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX> left
        imprinted on the steps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumitomo Bank</ENAMEX> at the moment of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúflash.</ENAMEX> ‚Äù
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> will surprise many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> expecting a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">victim‚Äôs</ENAMEX> account of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of this century‚Äôs most controversial decisions;
        yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> have gone to considerable lengths to document the
        horror of atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and nuclear war in general, driving toward the
        inevitable conclusion that such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> must never again be used.
        Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Cenotaph</ENAMEX> contains the names of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108,956</NUMEX> casualties, with the inscription: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúLet all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">souls</ENAMEX> here rest
        in peace, for the evil shall not be repeated. ‚Äù There is also a huge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bronze Peace Bell</ENAMEX>. At the northern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> stands the lone
        structure preserved since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX>: the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima Prefectural</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Promotion Hall</ENAMEX>, now known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúA-Bomb Dome</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        After visiting the emotionally powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, you may
        wish to seek a therapeutic antidote in the lively shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> east
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hondori, Hachobori</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kamiya-cho</ENAMEX>. But the ultimate
        venue to restore the spirit is tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miyajima</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 30 minutes</TIMEX>
        away.
        Miyajima
        Also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itsukushima</ENAMEX> after its celebrated waterfront
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miyajima</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular travel
        destinations. Make a very early start to beat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. (It takes
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">25 minutes</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Miyajima-guchi Station</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railways</ENAMEX>, and then <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> by ferry to the island. )
        Even if you feel you‚Äôve seen enough <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>, you
        will certainly be moved by the striking beauty of the bright red
        camphorwood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itsukushima Shrine</ENAMEX> rising <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> ft) out of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> in front of the low, brilliant vermilion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, themselves
        raised above the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> by stilts. Founded as far back as the 6th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is so sacred that, until the fresh wind of reforms
        instituted during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Meiji</ENAMEX> era beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>, pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and the
        seriously ill were carried to the mainland to ensure that no births or
        deaths would occur on the island. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mourners</ENAMEX> had to undergo <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 days</TIMEX> of
        purification before being allowed back on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miyajima</ENAMEX>. While most such
        religious laws have been relaxed, burials are still not permitted
        here.
        Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miyajima</ENAMEX> manages to be both solemn and lively.
        Sacred bugaku and kagura dances are performed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, while
        numerous souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a roaring</TIMEX> trade in the local specialties:
        woodcarvings, both sacred and utterly pornographic, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maple</ENAMEX>-leaf-shaped sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">buns</ENAMEX> (momiji). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find handsome polished
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cedarwood</ENAMEX> cups, bowls, trays, and masks‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇas well as kitsch renditions
        of the tame <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> that loiter lazily around the island‚Äôs major tourist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attractions</ENAMEX>, waiting (sometimes impatiently) for a free snack from yet
        another fascinated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>.
        Although most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take the ropeway, the easily
        negotiable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> leading to the top of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">530-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,739</NUMEX>-ft) <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Misen</ENAMEX> is an
        invigorating hike. The forest is lush and, past the secluded Gumonjido
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, the view from the top over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland Sea</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>
        is a fine reward. From the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Misen</ENAMEX> is one of the ‚Äúthree finest
        views‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
        For such a small island, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miyajima</ENAMEX> has much to offer. But
        stay until after the crowds depart in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the late afternoon</TIMEX> and early
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>. To take in the sight of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> against the glorious
        setting sun, spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miyajima‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many Japanese-style
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX>, preferably a family-run ryokan or pension (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">228</NUMEX>).After dinner, don your cotton yukata robe and pad out the short
        distance back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Itsukushima Shrine</ENAMEX>. After sundown, the shrine‚Äôs
        atmosphere is utterly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">transformed‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcool</ENAMEX>, dark, and more than slightly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surreal</ENAMEX>, with the subtly illuminated arch dominating the scene. If the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tide</ENAMEX> is out, walk down to the base of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> to appreciate its
        massive scale.
        Shikoku
        Despite being Shikoku island‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsuyama</ENAMEX> is
        a laid-back place, mainly serving as the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>
        visiting the hot springs situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.5 miles</NUMEX>) away. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dogo Spa</ENAMEX> is a
        great place to try out a public bathhouse: don your cotton <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kimono</ENAMEX> and
        clogs, too (if you can manage them). The spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is alkaline and
        crystal clear, and good for stomach ailments, the lungs, and the
        nervous system.
        Pleasingly unlandscaped, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shiroyama Park</ENAMEX> covers the lovely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wooded slopes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Katsuyama Hill</ENAMEX>. It is dominated by the well-preserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsuyama Castle</ENAMEX>, which was once the redoubt of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsudaira</ENAMEX> daimyo.
        This most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful lieutenant</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> distinguished
        himself by planting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX> forest around the shoguns‚Äô mausoleums at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>.
        Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dogo Spa</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> Ishiteji
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX>, one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> stages of the springtime <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> pilgrimage
        around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shikoku</ENAMEX> defined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kobo Daishi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shingon</ENAMEX> esoteric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice the</ENAMEX> especially handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Niomon Gate</ENAMEX>.
        Situated at the eastern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shikoku</ENAMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurashiki</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Okayama</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takamatsu</ENAMEX>, another friendly
        provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> seem to receive a particularly warm
        welcome. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> are very proud of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ritsurin Park</ENAMEX>, with its bizarre
        twisted pines and strangely shaped boulders. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folk</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> here
        is worth a visit, but also stop for a gracious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> ceremony at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">delightful Kiku-getsu-tei</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt miss the pavilion‚Äôs little
        rock garden, a classic of the genre.
        A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> tram ride takes you out to the Yashima
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peninsula</ENAMEX>, formerly an island famed for the momentous battles in which
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Minamoto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> drove out their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taira</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1182</TIMEX>, heralding the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">country‚Äôs</ENAMEX> rule by military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next seven centuries</TIMEX>.
        Today, ruins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taira</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">clan‚Äôs dwellings</ENAMEX> are still visible, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yashimaji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple houses</ENAMEX> relics of the battles.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX>
        Lying the farthest southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main islands,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX> has always set itself apart from the others. Its climate is
        distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> and even subtropical at its southern tip, and
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> are known for being friendlier, more open, and even
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúWesternized‚Äù</ENAMEX> than their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compatriots</ENAMEX> in the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX> is also the most volcanic of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs islands, famous for its
        flourishing hot-spring resorts and several active volcanoes. It is a
        terrific place to explore if you have the time. If you can afford the
        ‚Äúbullet train‚Äù just once, this is your chance, as‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin one exhilarating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sweep‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou</ENAMEX> pass through almost all the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Honshu</ENAMEX> on the way.
        Easily accessible from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> mainland via <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX> has a longer history of significant contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>
        than any other part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. This was especially the case after it
        found itself on the southern route taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. Indeed, the famous port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nagasaki</ENAMEX> served as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sole point of contact with the outside world
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">260 years</TIMEX> of self-imposed isolation.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX> enjoys its special place in the national mythology
        as the cradle of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> civilization, despite the support of only a
        meager amount of archeological evidence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> tells of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goddess Amaterasu</ENAMEX> sending her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Takachiho</ENAMEX> in central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX>, armed with the imperial mirror, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX>, and jewel that Jimmu
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first emperor</ENAMEX>) used on his conquest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Yamato Plain</ENAMEX> near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nara</ENAMEX>. Modern historians‚Äô version is rather less exotic: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmu</ENAMEX> was
        probably a pirate from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okinawa</ENAMEX> who settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX> before launching
        his campaign to conquer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honshu</ENAMEX>.
        The island‚Äôs next important historical encounter was with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mongols</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kublai Khan</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kyushu</ENAMEX> was the target of abortive
        assaults in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1274 and 1281</TIMEX>. The islanders‚Äô heroic resistance, admittedly
        abetted by a timely typhoon (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kamikaze: ‚Äúdivine wind‚Äù</ENAMEX>), earned them a
        formidable martial reputation. The island proved to be the last bastion
        of the samurai ideal, when disenfranchised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX> launched the doomed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satsuma Rebellion</ENAMEX> in their desperation to forestall the relentless
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">march</TIMEX> of progress. It was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kagoshima</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Japanese Navy</ENAMEX>
        was created from the nucleus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> bought from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> at the
        end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kagoshima</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1543</TIMEX>, with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis Xavier</ENAMEX> following close behind. In
        addition to becoming a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of Western trade, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagasaki</ENAMEX> provided a
        firm foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtoday much revived
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">250 years</TIMEX> of brutal suppression under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shoguns.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Kyushu</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fukuoka</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main commercial center, where you can
        tour the lively shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> around the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hakata</ENAMEX>.
        The delicate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hakataningyo</ENAMEX> dolls (the town‚Äôs specialty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX>) make
        attractive gifts, although as works of art for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> rather than toys
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Bayside Place is a thriving nighttime eating and
        entertainment district built alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hakata</ENAMEX> wharf in the old merchant
        district, with attractively illuminated sculptures adding to the
        atmosphere. Enthusiastic and adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX> should also look out
        for the numerous food <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> (yatai) found throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>,
        especially those offering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hakata</ENAMEX> ramen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX>, famed throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
        Otherwise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fukuoka</ENAMEX> mainly serves as the launching point for your
        exploration of the bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX> to the south.
        The first stop on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">east coast</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Beppu‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇperhaps the
        busiest and certainly the most intense spa <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, with a
        permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 150,000</NUMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 13 million</NUMEX> visitors a

        with different properties. These include a hot waterfall at the

        Beppu‚Äôs most popular attractions are the open-air ‚Äúhell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ponds‚Äù</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kannawa</ENAMEX>, which are alternately hilarious and dramatic. In

        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bozu Jigoku (‚ÄúMonk‚Äôs Hell‚Äù</ENAMEX>), an obscenely bubbling
        mud pond where a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> once stood until it was submerged in
        an earthquake back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>.
        Also near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kannawa</ENAMEX> are several hot-spring developments,
        including attractive open-air rock <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral mud</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve</ENAMEX> got it? <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">We‚Äôll</ENAMEX> cure it! ‚Äù reputation. But if heat is your thing,
        pay a visit to the grand old Meiji-era <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Takegawara</ENAMEX> public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, not far
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train station</ENAMEX>. The old wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is simply
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magnificent</ENAMEX>, although its hot bath is one of the most basic you‚Äôre
        likely to encounter. For just <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¬•620</NUMEX> you can lie down and have hot sand
        raked over you by a grinning, grandmotherly attendant‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten-minute</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ordeal you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> never forget.
        One unusual attraction not mentioned in the official
        tourist literature is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Beppu‚Äôs ‚</ENAMEX>Äúsex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which is famous throughout
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. There are several such collections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, consisting of
        bizarre images, sculptures, and elaborate dioramas depicting many of
        the darker aspects of human sexuality, often with fantasies involving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demons</ENAMEX> and monsters perpetrating unspeakable deeds upon helpless
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mortals</ENAMEX>. This is another ‚Äúonly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan‚Äù</ENAMEX> experience, one definitely not
        for the faint-hearted.
        The rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yufuin</ENAMEX> is relaxed, gentle, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">charming</ENAMEX>, featuring old-fashioned farmhouses around tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kinrinko Lake</ENAMEX>.
        Set at the foot of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Yufu‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇan extinct volcano covered by dense
        bamboo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">forest‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇYufuin</ENAMEX> is famous for its hot-spring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, most of
        which you can try for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a few hundred</NUMEX> yen. The helpful tourist
        information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> can direct you to the most popular
        or unusual spots, especially those with outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> (rotenburo).
        The excellent Folk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craft Museum</ENAMEX> in an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor house</ENAMEX>
        holds regular demonstrations of local arts and crafts. Hard-core
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX> of local culture will find a single day insufficient for
        visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yufuin‚Äôs Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX>, the unexpected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Chagall</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>. The gentle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> along the small
        rivers that meander through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> provide serene views of ricefields
        and superb scenery.
        Farther south, the thick groves of palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> lining the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miyazaki</ENAMEX> serve as a reminder of its position on the edge of
        the tropics. This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort town</ENAMEX> has a long and usually uncrowded sandy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>, and there are several pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX> among the palm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Heiwadai Park</ENAMEX> brings together the prehistoric past and the
        frequently strange present. The park‚Äôs prefectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays some
        small clay figures (haniwa) unearthed at nearby ancient burial mounds,
        together with pots, tools, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> dating back to as early as
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 b.c.</NUMEX> The grounds are dominated by the bizarre and grandiose
        Peace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX>, which, curiously, was erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX>. At that time it had
        a different name: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hakko</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ichi</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">wu (‚ÄúEight World Regions Under One Roof‚Äù</ENAMEX>),
        embodying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militarist</ENAMEX> aims of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Japanese Army</ENAMEX>. More
        palatable in its goal is the park‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miyazaki Shrine</ENAMEX>, dedicated to
        Japan‚Äôs quasi-legendary <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jimmu</ENAMEX>, who reputedly commenced
        his glorious career in this region.
        Just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miyazaki</ENAMEX> is one of the many results of
        Japan‚Äôs grandiose spending projects that characterized the ‚Äúbubble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">economy‚Äù</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years of the 1980s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagaia Ocean Dome</ENAMEX>, the
        largest indoor water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in the world, comprises an artificially
        landscaped beach complete with palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and a giant wave pool to
        complete the illusion of a tropical paradise. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> are
        enclosed within a huge retractable roof.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South of Miyazaki</ENAMEX>, the little island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aoshima</ENAMEX> is
        connected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX> by a footbridge and surrounded by strange,
        wave-like rocks believed to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 15 million and 30 million</NUMEX> years
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>. Beyond Aoshima the picturesque, winding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nichinan</ENAMEX> coast alternates
        rugged cliffs with some fine sandy bathing beaches. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> along
        this coast is especially good: try the reasonably priced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lobster</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giant</ENAMEX> periwinkles.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Kyushu</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagoshima</ENAMEX> dominates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a deep indentation at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu</ENAMEX>, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> has played a prominent role in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> military history. It was here that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> landed,
        bringing to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, and Christianity. The
        sailors‚Äô <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landfall</ENAMEX> was on the little offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> of
        Tanegashima, which has progressed from matchlocks and muskets to being
        Japan‚Äôs principal rocket-launching <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
        It was from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagoshima</ENAMEX> that the last desperate sorties of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> were begun to resist an imminent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> invasion, including
        the kamikaze raids on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">warships</ENAMEX>. Inevitably, devastating
        bombing reprisals flattened the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. But modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagoshima</ENAMEX> is now an
        attractive green and airy place, with wide boulevards, delightful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parks</ENAMEX>, and a couple of intriguing historical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shiroyama Park</ENAMEX> (southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagoshima Station</ENAMEX>) is up on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX>, giving you a fine view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kagoshima Bay</ENAMEX> through the
        archway of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nanshu Shrine</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyushu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most
        celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚Äôs</ENAMEX> national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takamori Saigo</ENAMEX>, last
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champion</ENAMEX> of the samurai. He is buried with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,023</NUMEX> of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>,
        who died in the ill-fated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1877</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Satsuma Rebellion</ENAMEX>. This was the last
        stand of the samurai against the overthrow of their time-honored
        privileges. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takamori</ENAMEX> himself, died by their
        own hand in a final gesture of defiance. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is
        devoted to his life and battles. Nearby, the history of the Kagoshima
        region is nicely summed up in the ultramodern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reimeikan Prefectural</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>, which includes local arts and crafts as well as examples of
        those <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> matchlock <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">couple of miles</NUMEX> or so north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagoshima Station</ENAMEX> are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lovely Iso Gardens</ENAMEX>, also landscaped on a hill, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lord</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satsuma</ENAMEX> had his villa. Be sure to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shoko Shuseikan Museum</ENAMEX>,
        housed in an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> established here by the forward-looking leader
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> manufacture and other new industries.
        Out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bay‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtowering</ENAMEX> over the entire peninsula‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis
        Japan‚Äôs most notoriously active volcano, the huge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-coned
        Sakurajima, which sends up tremendous black and white clouds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ash</ENAMEX> and
        steam. Take a taxi or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagoshima Station</ENAMEX>) for a closer look at
        the lava and a fine view of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kagoshima Bay area</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sakurajima</ENAMEX> peninsula was once an island until a gigantic eruption in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1914</TIMEX>, when the rocks and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lava</ENAMEX> joined it forever to the mainland. A
        powerful illustration of the magnitude of the eruption is found at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haragosha Shrine</ENAMEX>, where you can just see the top cross bar of the
        shrine‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX>, the rest submerged by hardened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lava</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis Xavier Memorial Church</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xavier Park</ENAMEX> (tram
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takamibaba</ENAMEX> stop), was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX> to commemorate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 400th</TIMEX>
        anniversary of the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit</ENAMEX> missionary. His
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">statue‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇinexplicably pinned halfway</ENAMEX> up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monolith</ENAMEX> in a very
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">martyr</ENAMEX>-like pose, although he died in his bed (in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>)‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇstands</ENAMEX> with

        Ibusuki, south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagoshima</ENAMEX>, is a hot-spring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> that
        caters to honeymoon <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">couples‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhundreds</ENAMEX> of them at a time. However, the
        main draw is its famous natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> bath. Clad only in a cotton
        kimono, you lie down for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> to bury you up to the neck in sand
        at a medium-broil temperature. Just stare up at the sky while you sweat
        off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few</NUMEX> pounds and the attendant shovels on fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>. As the local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber of commerce</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hilariously</ENAMEX> puts it: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúIt is not only effective for
        overall beauty, but also for whiplash injuries caused by traffic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accidents</ENAMEX>, and popular with newlyweds. ‚Äù A more cynical view is that
        the sands provide a cure for which there is no known disease.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiran</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 minutes</TIMEX> inland by bus from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagoshima</ENAMEX>) is a
        peaceful, secluded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> samurai <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. In classically narrow,
        zigzagging <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> designed to hinder surprise attack, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, today
        still inhabited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Satsuma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors‚Äô descendants</ENAMEX>, offer the rare
        opportunity to visit some exquisite private gardens, otherwise
        carefully concealed behind tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX>. The simple, serene style of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landscaping</ENAMEX>, with rocks, gravel, and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>, draws on the
        precepts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zen Buddhism</ENAMEX> that had such a special appeal for the austere
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samurai</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiran‚Äôs Kamikaze Museum</ENAMEX>, which includes a monumental
        statue of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, exhibits the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men‚</ENAMEX>Äôs uniforms, helmets, and
        final letters to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> explaining that they were continuing
        the samurai spirit of defending the country‚Äôs traditional values. There
        are also full-scale models of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>, with a fuel tank big enough
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only a</NUMEX> one-way mission.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Kyushu</ENAMEX>
        Halfway back along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kyushu‚Äôs west coast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumamoto</ENAMEX> is an old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that was of considerable importance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shoguns
        as a counterweight to the presence of the annoyingly independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimazu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kagoshima</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumamoto</ENAMEX> serves as
        a convenient gateway for the scenic road trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Aso</ENAMEX> volcano or
        a ferry cruise to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Unzen-Amakusa National Park</ENAMEX>.
        The reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumamoto Castle</ENAMEX> is worth a visit for the
        significant role it played during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last hectic days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feudal</ENAMEX> era. Once a vast fortification of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> turrets, it ranked
        alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagoya</ENAMEX> as one of the country‚Äôs greatest impregnable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bastions</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX> ferroconcrete reconstruction of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>-keep
        houses a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of feudal armor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and offers a good view
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Suizenji Park</ENAMEX> is an extravagant but attractive example of
        the extensive gardens of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> have
        reproduced a miniature version of all the major landscape features
        along the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tokaido Highway</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Edo‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇincluding</ENAMEX>, of
        course, a small artificial version of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Fuji</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumamoto</ENAMEX> to the mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Aso</ENAMEX> volcano
        takes you across some gently rolling hills, past orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX>, fields
        of watermelon, and the special <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> used for tatami mats. There is
        even a rare sight of yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat fields‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgrown</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX>
        rather than for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> (which is mostly imported). The panorama of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> volcanic craters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Aso</ENAMEX> blends vivid emerald-green mounds with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX> carpets of pink azaleas on the surrounding slopes and plateau.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of the craters, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nakadake</ENAMEX>, is still really active. But it is
        well worth a visit to the top (a short hike from the bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX>) to peer
        down into the bleak, barren crater emitting puffs of sulfurous fumes
        and contrasting starkly with the colorful vegetation all around it.
        On your way back down, allow enough time to visit the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fascinating Aso Volcanic Museum</ENAMEX>. This has some very realistic
        audio-visual re-enactments of eruptions and earthquakes, with special
        stereo sound effects. Three-dimensional models of exploding mountains
        and molten lava flows from all over the world are shown. You can press
        a button to see <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America‚Äôs Mt. St Helen‚</ENAMEX>Äôs blow its top, or you can
        relive the astonishing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1933</TIMEX> eruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Aso</ENAMEX> itself.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Unzen-Amakusa National Park</ENAMEX>, consisting of a peninsula
        and islands west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumamoto</ENAMEX>, is most pleasantly reached on a
        picturesque <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> ferry trip from the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Misumi</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shimabara</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> is dotted with the pine-covered islands of
        Tsukumo, offering delightful bathing along white-sand beaches. Unzen
        itself, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">favored ‚Äúhill station‚Äù</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> escaping the
        steaming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> mainland, is now a rather noisy, crowded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. It serves best as an overnight stay prior to an early
        morning hike around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unzen</ENAMEX> volcano‚Äôs craters. The volcano last
        erupted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring 1991</TIMEX>, but it is no longer considered dangerous.
        Nagasaki
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagasaki</ENAMEX> is an unexpectedly charming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. To a large
        extent, this reflects its unbroken experience of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than four</NUMEX>
        centuries of hospitality to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">foreigners‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇChinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dutch‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇduring</ENAMEX> a period in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> history when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was
        characterized by often murderous xenophobia. It is also a surprisingly
        attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>: sadly, a relative rarity among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs bland,
        homogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Its natural harbor, surrounded by green hills, is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most attractive in the world. Indeed, the city‚Äôs distinct
        geography allowed most of its older neighborhoods to survive the
        terrible destruction wrought by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> to be dropped on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 August 1945‚ÄÇ‚</TIMEX>Äî‚ÄÇdespite the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nagasaki</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> was
        more powerful than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dropped on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days earlier</TIMEX>.
        Long before the arrival of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>, Nagasaki
        had been a major focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
        influence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is clearly noticeable even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. Major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        temples, profiting from the suppression of Christianity during the 17th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, were established by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> Zen monks and designed in the
        style of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ming Dynasty</ENAMEX>. On a more mundane contemporary level,
        the most popular Nagasaki lunch is a solid, nourishing bowl of chanpon:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tangy fish broth</ENAMEX> laden with a cornucopia of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, prawns, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goodies</ENAMEX>.
        Near the centrally located <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Railways</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sign of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> role in the city‚Äôs fascinating history. A
        monument to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">martyrs</ENAMEX> executed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1597</TIMEX> (at the beginning of
        Japan‚Äôs repression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholicism</ENAMEX>) includes a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displaying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relics</ENAMEX>, including a communion wafer that has survived in dehydrated
        form since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> describes how other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>
        were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boiled</ENAMEX> alive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1615</TIMEX> at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Unzen</ENAMEX> hot springs. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear</ENAMEX> in
        mind, of course, that equally cruel religious persecution of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholics</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Protestants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> was quite common in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> at that time. )
        Even after the persecution and banishing of missionaries
        and the ban on Christianity, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nagasaki‚Äôs Catholics</ENAMEX> still managed‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇat
        great <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">risk‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇto</ENAMEX> continue clandestine observance throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shogunate. They even went to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples to worship
        the feminine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kannon</ENAMEX> deities, which were resculpted holding a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">represent Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>, however, being nonproselytizing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestants</ENAMEX>,
        were allowed to stay on throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs centuries of isolation.
        Their little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dejima Island</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nagasaki Bay</ENAMEX>, sheltered the
        only remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> left in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Oranda-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">san (‚</ENAMEX>ÄúDutch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">people‚Äù</ENAMEX>) eventually became the accepted term for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>.
        To get a good sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagasaki‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX>, start down
        at the harbor. Boat tours begin from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohata Port Terminal</ENAMEX>,
        taking you on a fascinating <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50-minute</TIMEX> cruise around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nagasaki Bay</ENAMEX>. Your
        excursion steamer will feel like a child‚Äôs toy as it passes the
        gigantic supertankers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Shipyard</ENAMEX>. Now the largest
        private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shipyard</ENAMEX> in the world, this was the intended target that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-52</ENAMEX> missed when it dropped the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dejima Pier</ENAMEX> has been reconnected to the mainland from what
        was once the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> island concession. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> here has interesting
        relics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is a model of the
        neat little settlement they established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1609</TIMEX>, when the only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese</ENAMEX>
        permitted to visit were trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prostitutes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> has
        always been an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> of cultural barriers.
        To see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later era</TIMEX> lived, climb the
        cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hollander Slope</ENAMEX> (number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> tram to the Ishibashi
        stop), where you‚Äôll see some red-brick and wooden clapboard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with
        colonial-style verandahs <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">and‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> rare sight atop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Japan‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇchimneys</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are an enduring monument to the privileged
        position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> allowed to live here.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> presence in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nagasaki</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nostalgically</ENAMEX> commemorated at the hillside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glover Gardens</ENAMEX>, a short
        distance west of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hollander Slope</ENAMEX>. Escalators take you up to the houses
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>. To the delighted curiosity of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are filled with the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> paraphernalia that is
        becoming increasingly popular in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>: damask-covered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">furniture</ENAMEX>, an upright piano, a massive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mahogany sideboard</ENAMEX>, and a grand
        old gramophone with a big horn, manufactured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon</ENAMEX>-Ophone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Company</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kofukuji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zen Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples
        built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1620</TIMEX>) after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoguns</ENAMEX> had outlawed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christianity</ENAMEX> and ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> to register as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhists</ENAMEX>. In a
        picturesque setting with palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, the temple‚Äôs
        architecture and sculpture are typical of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kofukuji</ENAMEX> also
        offers (by advanced reservation) a frugal but tasty vegetarian meal
        cooked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> themselves. Meal times are announced by the
        beating of a big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red ‚Äúfish‚Äù gong</ENAMEX>.
        The pride and joy of the neighborhood is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meganebashi</ENAMEX>,
        a double-arched stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nakajima River</ENAMEX>. It was built in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1634</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abbot of Kofukuji</ENAMEX> and is the oldest of its kind in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The reflection of the double arches in the river on a fairly
        calm day creates a visual image resembling a pair of eyeglasses. The
        narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> bordering the river are full of interesting antique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, coffee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sofukuji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1629</TIMEX>) is a handsome example of late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ming</ENAMEX>
        Dynasty architecture, with its striking vermilion-painted, stone-arched
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">tower gate</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is a huge iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cauldron</ENAMEX> that was used for
        distributing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> gruel to the poor during famines in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th</TIMEX> and 19th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> statues here are notable for their
        variously proud, cheerful, or humble stances not to be seen in the
        Buddhas of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> temples.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagasaki Peace Park</ENAMEX> embraces the epicenter of the
        atomic blast that left <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73,884</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> dead, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74,904</NUMEX> injured, and a
        miraculous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71,585</NUMEX> unscathed. The hills surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> did much to
        contain the subsequent atomic fallout. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> features a monumental
        sculpture (by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitamura Seibo</ENAMEX>) that stirred considerable
        controversy when unveiled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>. The massive figure‚Äôs right hand
        points skyward‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtoward the actual point of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detonation‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇas</ENAMEX> a warning
        of the constant threat of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, while his left hand
        stretches out in a gesture of universal peace. As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>, one of
        the most moving monuments is a single piece of masonry left standing.
        In this case, it is the red-brick and gray-stone remains of an arch
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urakami Catholic Church</ENAMEX>, at the time the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
        A visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagasaki</ENAMEX> is meaningless without a stop at its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provocative</ENAMEX> and challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atomic Bomb Museum</ENAMEX>. The exhibits powerfully
        document the build-up to the dropping of the atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> on Nagasaki
        and the appalling effects of the blast itself and its aftermath. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curators</ENAMEX> have done a good job of separating any military justification
        for the decision from its tragic consequences for the civilian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, the final message is not of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> demanding sympathy but of an entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> committed to
        total nuclear disarmament for the sake of the entire planet, with its
        own message of ‚ÄúNever again. ‚Äù
        Finally, at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of a long day</TIMEX>, take the cable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to
        the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mt. Inasa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">332 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,089 ft</NUMEX>) high, for a dramatic sunset view
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagasaki</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> as city lights begin to sparkle.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Honshu and Hokkaido</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to the northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> are more
        sparsely inhabited and tend to be less often visited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>,
        either foreign or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>. But both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Honshu‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇwhich is more
        commonly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúTohoku‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand the northernmost island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido</ENAMEX>
        offer the advantage of unspoiled countryside and friendly down-to-earth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> still imbued with something of a frontier spirit. Their
        folkcrafts are authentic and much less commercialized than in most
        other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>. And their festivals, in an area without the usual
        sorts of urban entertainment, are frequent, colorful, and more
        spontaneous than in the more densely populated regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        No overall picture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> life can be complete without a short
        visit to these northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX>.
        Tohoku
        Until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokugawa</ENAMEX> shoguns completed their conquest of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> on, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tohoku</ENAMEX> constituted the
        northern boundaries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. Beyond them were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>
        of the native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ainu</ENAMEX>, at that time not considered ‚ÄúJapanese. ‚Äù It was
        only when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ainu</ENAMEX> were progressively driven north up into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido</ENAMEX>
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tohoku</ENAMEX> was opened up to broader settlement.
        Its massive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> yield (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 20 percent</NUMEX> of the
        national <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>) has made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tohoku</ENAMEX> the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> of the country‚Äôs
        needs. Thus, the general trend for more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX> to drift away
        from the land to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> has been noticeably less marked here. The
        very remoteness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tohoku</ENAMEX> was appealing to such religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zen Buddhists</ENAMEX>, who espouse an ascetic, unworldly life and constructed
        some of the country‚Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples in this northern part of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honshu</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushima</ENAMEX> is considered one of the country‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scenic Beauties</ENAMEX> (part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> passion for cataloging things in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of this or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of that. ) Although you can reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Matsushima</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 minutes</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sendai</ENAMEX>, the best way is to stop off at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiogama</ENAMEX> and take the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-hour</TIMEX> boat cruise across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Matsushima Bay</ENAMEX>.
        Scores of tiny islands dot the bay, their white <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sandstone</ENAMEX> shaped by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> into arches, caves, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyramids</ENAMEX> and covered with lovely,
        wispy sea pines. The changing perspective as you cruise slowly past is
        extraordinary.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushima</ENAMEX>, visit the pretty Kanrantei
        Pavilion for one of the best views of the bay from a rocky cliff beside
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing stage</ENAMEX> for the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. But practically any point on
        the hills rising behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> will offer you a spectacular view.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zuiganji</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is the center of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zen Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seminary</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1609</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lord</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tohoku</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masamune Date</ENAMEX>. In the temple‚Äôs treasure house you can see a statue of
        the crusty old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlord</ENAMEX> in all his armor. He lost his right eye‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfrom
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">smallpox</ENAMEX>, not in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">battle‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> was nicknamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dokugan-ryu (‚ÄúOne-Eyed</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story caves hewn from the rock that serve as
        accommodation for itinerant monks.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hiraizumi‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇjust</ENAMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minutes</TIMEX> bus ride from

        period (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 12th century</TIMEX>). Chusonji was erected by the Fujiwara
        family when their power behind the imperial throne in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kyoto</ENAMEX> was waning.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple‚Äôs structures</ENAMEX> have survived the countless wars of the

        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiyohira Fujiwara</ENAMEX> built for himself in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1124</TIMEX>. Everything except the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kamakura</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, is believed to be what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> was after in his
        search for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> he called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chipangu</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyozo</ENAMEX> is even older
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1108</TIMEX>) and used to house the temple‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> scriptures (sutras ),

        Not opened up to full-scale settlement until after the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meiji Restoration</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1868</TIMEX>, the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japan‚Äôs ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúFar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù Here are some of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> who enjoy uncrowded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>,
        unspoiled wilderness, and a simpler existence in a climate and
        landscape comparable to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">snowcapped</NUMEX> mountains and pine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forest</ENAMEX>, with a subarctic climate in the northernmost area. The island‚Äôs
        capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapporo</ENAMEX>, was a natural choice for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Olympic</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are mild enough for good camping and hiking.
        At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX> unemployed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samurai‚Äî‚ÄÇadventurous</ENAMEX> but still attached to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">traditions‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇtook
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido</ENAMEX> to carve out a new life for themselves.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> helped to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hokkaido‚Äôs</ENAMEX> agriculture and coal
        mining industries and to lay out an urban grid system for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapporo</ENAMEX>.
        After years of neglect and discrimination, the cultural
        significance of the tiny though historically significant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ainu</ENAMEX> community
        is finally being recognized. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hokkaido</ENAMEX> now has some fascinating museums
        devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ainu</ENAMEX> life, and the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiraoi</ENAMEX> preserves the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifacts</ENAMEX> and folkcrafts of their culture.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapporo</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most attractive postwar urban innovations in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapporo‚Äôs Odori Promenade</ENAMEX>, a broad green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> lined with
        flower beds, lilacs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">maples‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> with fountains down the middle,
        running east to west for a straight mile. It‚Äôs a great place to start
        your visit.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sapporo</ENAMEX> has a nationwide reputation for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>,
        introduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1870s</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brewer</ENAMEX> who recognized the
        surrounding country‚Äôs hop-growing potential. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> garden, to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northeast</ENAMEX> of the downtown area, is a lusty place to sample the town‚Äôs
        frontier spirit.
        Around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Island</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Shikotsu</ENAMEX>, a volcanic crater lake situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chitose</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, provides one of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hokkaido‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        most picturesque camping and hiking areas. There‚Äôs great salmon fishing

        Not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">spa town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noboribetsu</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shiraoi</ENAMEX>, a
        well-reconstructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ainu</ENAMEX> village complete with artisans demonstrating
        traditional arts and crafts. The superb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ainu Museum</ENAMEX>, established with
        the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">anthropologists</ENAMEX>, features a vivid
        exhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ainu</ENAMEX> history.
