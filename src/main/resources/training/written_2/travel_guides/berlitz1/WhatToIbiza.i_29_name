        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢What</ENAMEX> to Do
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Sports</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outdoor Activities</ENAMEX>
        With sunshine throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and with the temperate
        waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> lapping its shores, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> is ideal for
        aquatic-sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> is on swimming and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sailing</ENAMEX>, you may well prefer to do nothing more strenuous than lie in
        the sun and be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Formentera</ENAMEX>, for its part, boasts fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and some of
        the most enticing sandy beaches, to say nothing of windsurfing and
        scuba diving that can‚Äôt be bettered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢One important note of caution: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> sun easily
        wreaks havoc with the unwary, and it really is a case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúonly mad dogs</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englishmen</ENAMEX>,‚Äù as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel Coward</ENAMEX> put it. Leave it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mad dogs</ENAMEX>. Half
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour in the morning</TIMEX> and late afternoon creates the groundwork for a
        good tan. At all times it‚Äôs a good idea to wear a T-shirt or something
        light to protect your shoulders, as well as a hat. Don‚Äôt be complacent
        even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>: delicate northern noses have been seen to peel under
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> sun.
        ‚Ä¢Watersports
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Boating</ENAMEX> and sailing. Very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> arrive in their
        own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> or are otherwise totally self-sufficient for sailing in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, but the yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and many of the beaches supply
        sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> for hire, and some also have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. The rates are about
        the same as in mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, and sometimes cheaper.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢According</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> law, only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captains</ENAMEX> who have an
        official licence can operate motorboats. This law is rigidly enforced;
        consequently, motorboats are seldom available for hire to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Sailboats.</ENAMEX> Suitable for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, these are just the
        ticket if you want to learn to sail. Beach bars and most watersports
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> rent out sailboats. Instruction is optional, but advisable for
        real novices.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Pedalos.</ENAMEX> These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-seat contraptions ply the seas powered
        by a foot-driven waterwheel. They are sufficiently stable for a young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to be aboard accompanied by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>, and are perfect as a
        personalized ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to reach coves for snorkelling or just to avoid
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pedalos</ENAMEX> can be hired by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX>, but you should always
        allow yourself plenty of time to return to shore before your rental
        period has expired.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Windsurfing</ENAMEX> is a major attraction on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Formentera</ENAMEX>;
        equipment can be hired at escuelas de windsurfing as well as many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>. This sport has more or less taken the place of waterskiing,
        which is not nearly as common now.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Fishing</ENAMEX> along the rocks of the coastline is a popular
        pursuit, no matter how unlikely the prospect of a large catch.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Offshore</ENAMEX>, the professional fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">business‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich</ENAMEX> was once a major
        source of income in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhas</ENAMEX> dwindled significantly. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>,
        island fishmongers are just as likely to sell frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from afar as
        the freshly caught local article. Some dawdling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> work the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza‚Äôs Riu de la Santa Eul√†ria</ENAMEX>, especially at the point where
        it empties into the sea, but if you‚Äôre having a go yourself don‚Äôt
        expect too much more than a nibble.
        You might have more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fun‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand even success‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚Äúspinning‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        from the back of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>; catches of brill <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost half a metre</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">11‚ÅÑ2</ENAMEX>
        feet) long are not uncommon in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. The equipment is easily
        available and cheap.
        ‚Ä¢Scuba diving, snorkelling. Firstly, and most important of
        all, note that spearfishing with scuba equipment is forbidden.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> contain so much archaeological treasure
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> keeps a sharp eye on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>. Before you can
        dive underwater you need a licence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRIS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Recuperaci√≥n y Investigaciones Submarinas‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇUnderwater Recovery and</ENAMEX>
        Research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre</ENAMEX>). So be warned, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> take this seriously,
        and violators may be prosecuted.
        ‚Ä¢Scuba-diving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> operate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Formentera</ENAMEX>,
        though the locations tend to change from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX>. You must apply
        for a licence yourself, and a medical certificate is also required.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Fortunately</ENAMEX>, the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> can enjoy a hint of the
        thrills of undersea swimming. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snorkelling</ENAMEX> equipment is relatively cheap
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, but test the face mask carefully before you buy it. With
        a little practice almost anyone can flip off to an interesting rock
        formation and watch the multi-coloured <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> pass in review.
        Snorkel-fishing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">spear-guns</ENAMEX> is legal, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, which can often
        be frisky with unarmed snorkellers, now know to scatter at the sight of
        a harpoon.
        ‚Ä¢If you don‚Äôt feel squeamish about it, you can prowl the
        rocks in shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> with a face mask and spear in search of squid.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tentacled creatures</ENAMEX> may look terrible under water, but once out
        in the air they‚Äôre revealed as small and not dangerous. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of squid lurk among the rocks in very shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> along
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX>, and the only equipment you need to catch them is a face mask
        and gancho (hook). The problem is learning how to tell the difference
        between the squid and the rocks they settle in. If you can solve that
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> you‚Äôll have a lot of fun and a few catches too.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Swimming.</ENAMEX> Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ibiza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> offer
        their own freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera</ENAMEX>, however, this is not
        necessarily the rule.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Amenities</ENAMEX> inevitably come hand in hand with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>, so on
        the main beaches be prepared to do battle with lots of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seekers</ENAMEX>, all equally happy that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, toilets, showers, and
        changing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are there. Territorial rights, in the form of a deck
        chair, can be assured for a nominal sum.
        ‚Ä¢The concept of a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguard</ENAMEX> is unknown on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Formentera</ENAMEX> alike; some beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> do keep first-aid supplies.
        Fortunately, most of the favourite beaches are well protected from
        waves and undertow, and slope gradually. Normally they are safe, but on
        a rough day, take care.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢If</ENAMEX> you‚Äôre willing to wander off the beaten track you
        should be able to find cliff-backed coves with clear, blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or
        patches of sand scarcely large enough for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Other Sports</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Tennis.</ENAMEX> Although there are no grass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> on the islands,
        a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asphalt</ENAMEX> or composition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and
        apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Courts</ENAMEX> can be hired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hour‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou‚Äôll</ENAMEX> probably have to
        book ahead. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer professional coaching; prices vary
        greatly according to the reputation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢Whether you take your tennis seriously or just like to hit
        a ball around, be careful of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> sun. New arrivals especially
        should lie low during the most blistering <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to avoid burns or
        exhaustion.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Hunting</ENAMEX> and shooting. It‚Äôs not certain which came <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
        the famous Ibicenco hounds or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">island‚Äôs</ENAMEX> craze for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> hunting
        forays.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢In</ENAMEX> either case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> set off into the hills more for
        the exercise than for the kill. The occasional partridge and rabbit are
        about the extent of the possibilities. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> runs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Clay pigeon</ENAMEX> shooting is popular,
        too.
        ‚Ä¢Check for details on hunting permits at the local tourist
        office (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX>) or drop a line to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICONA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrer Sabino de Arana</ENAMEX>,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Golf</ENAMEX> and miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX>. One unexpected sight, in a remote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cala Llonga</ENAMEX>, is a civilized, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">meticulously</ENAMEX> tended,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exquisitely</ENAMEX> green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>. Those who feel a holiday isn‚Äôt the same
        without a game are welcome to tee off there.
        ‚Ä¢If you can‚Äôt get into the golf club scene, then why not
        try miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Eul√†ria</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portinatx</ENAMEX> on
        Ibiza, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club La Mola</ENAMEX> on quieter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Formentera</ENAMEX>?
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Archery.</ENAMEX> Those who are adept with a bow and arrow can keep
        their hand in on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera</ENAMEX>. Check at the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for
        details (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Horseback</ENAMEX> riding. The countryside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, with its
        gentle green hills and grid of back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, is perfectly suited to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">horseback</ENAMEX> riding. You can find stables in the following places:
        Portinatx, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Gertrudis</ENAMEX>, and near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Eul√†ria</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses suited</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢If</ENAMEX> you‚Äôre the equestrian type, then this is a good way to
        see the offbeat side of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Ibiza‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe unspoiled</ENAMEX> interior where life is
        still refreshingly simple.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">‚Ä¢Horse racing</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> are held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome Ibiza, Sant Rafel</ENAMEX>. The trotting race is a
        particularly exciting event to watch.
        ‚Ä¢Shopping
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Ä¢Shopping Hours</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Shopping hours</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibiza</ENAMEX> last from around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00 a.m. to 1:00</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">p.m. and from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m.</TIMEX> During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> remain open
        for an extra <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour</TIMEX> or more in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> to cope with the crush.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bars</ENAMEX> and caf√©s are usually open from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 a.m. until</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">midnight</ENAMEX> or later with no break for the siesta. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> open
        only during the tourist season, starting at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> and ending in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢Best Buys
        As a rule, prices on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> are higher than on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peninsula</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> you will find few real bargains.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Shoes</ENAMEX>: ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> can be quite
        cheap, but anything stylish is likely to cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as</NUMEX> at home.
        Traditional alpargatas‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇshoes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX> and hemp and a number of other
        ingenious indigenous <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">materials‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇare just the thing for outings to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>, shopping, or lounging around in comfort at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Bags</ENAMEX>: The straw bags that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibicencos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> hang over
        their shoulders for shopping or for carrying beach equipment are useful
        and inexpensive. They are made in several sizes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, for carrying odds and ends, or for buying out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX>.
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> these bags have proved so handy that to keep up with
        demand the local supply of genuine handmade bags has been augmented
        with imported goods.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Jewellery</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> and silver jewellery made on the spot or
        elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> is popular for both quality and price. You will also
        see ‚Äúhippie-made‚Äù jewellery on sale, especially at the market in Punta
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab√≠.</ENAMEX> Some of the artisans here look as if they‚Äôre straight out of the
        1960s.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Clothing</ENAMEX>: There‚Äôs nothing like the trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> clothing
        available here, styled on the island by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>-Lib
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. They are renowned as far away as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ibiza</ENAMEX> look.
        In another category altogether are the hand-knitted and crocheted
        articles made by island <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Pottery</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Locally</ENAMEX> produced pottery may also interest you.
        The terra-cotta bowls have centuries of tradition behind them; the
        ashtrays are also attractive, if obviously less authentic. Be careful
        what you choose, though, since inadequately fired, unglazed pottery is
        risky to ship or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pack</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Liquor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX>: These are both cheap compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> prices. Prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are low, while those at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> duty-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> are lower still. Imported <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> cigars,
        plentiful and cheap, are a favourite take-home present, though they‚Äôre
        still outlawed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Customs</ENAMEX>. While foreign-brand <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, produced
        under licence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, sells for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">just a few hundred pesetas</NUMEX> a bottle,
        there are more unusual local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirits</ENAMEX> that might make apt souvenirs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> are spiced with the island‚Äôs wild herbs, resulting
        in interesting and varied flavours. Hierbas, an√≠s seco, an√≠s dulce, and
        frigola are just a few names worth keeping a look-out for.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Herbs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>: Bought off the shelf in the local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarkets</ENAMEX>, these cost virtually nothing. Take home a bunch of tiny
        packets of colourful azafr√°n (saffron) and any other dried herbs you
        may fancy. An overpoweringly fragrant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> located in the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX> stocks just about every spice known to modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Ä¢Local foods</ENAMEX>: A variety of local and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foodstuffs</ENAMEX> can

        almonds, olives, olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>, sausage, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, and dried figs. Look for
        these items in the picturesque open-air market of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa Penya</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>)

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Antiques</ENAMEX>: In the past there must have been intriguing
        opportunities to buy up Ibicenco antiques and ship them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Nowadays
        it would take more time scrounging about than the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> is
        willing to invest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Browse</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, however, and you may find
        an appealing piece of old ironwork or hand carving. At the least you
        will always be able to take home a rusty old door key or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> suitable
        for haunted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, or a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> iron of genuine pre-electric
        vintage.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Where</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> offers the largest
        choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on the island. Quite a few establishments devote
        themselves primarily to their local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>, rather than stocking
        tourist extravagances. Here, too, you‚Äôll find all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clothe Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs trendier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚Ä¢Shopping Tips</ENAMEX>
        It‚Äôs always wise to price items in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> shop
        before deciding what and where to buy, as costs tend to vary.
        Occasionally, you will see a notice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sales‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇrebajas‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shop</ENAMEX> windows. Although legitimate sales do take place, usually at the
        end of the high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> to dispose of unsold stock, you‚Äôll have to be a
        bit cautious. What seems to be a special bargain price for just ‚Äúone
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> only‚Äù could turn out to be a year-round con. Here, too, shopping
        around is the best way to know a bargain if and when you see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haggling</ENAMEX> is now a thing of the past and unacceptable.
        ‚Ä¢Entertainment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Folklore</ENAMEX> of Ibiza
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢The</ENAMEX> truly local art form, found nowhere else, is Ibicenco
        folk singing and dancing. Regular shows take place in some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>,
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Miquel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Jos√©p</ENAMEX>, and there are often special
        one-time performances in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiestas</TIMEX>,
        mostly based on saints‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and religious festivals.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢First</ENAMEX>, a note about the lavish traditional costumes: the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> sport red hats (similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Catalonian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>), bandannas tied
        round their necks, gold-trimmed black corduroy or cotton jackets over
        their loose-fitting white shirts, bright red cummerbunds, baggy
        trousers of white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">linen‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX>, wide at the thighs but tight at the ankles,
        and the familiar Ibicenco straw shoes for comfort.
        ‚Ä¢The costume donned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> is more complex. It
        includes a long, pleated skirt of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homespun wool</ENAMEX>, either black or white;
        an apron with complicated patterns; a fine silk, long-tasselled shawl
        over the shoulders; and a big lace mantilla over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, with hair
        braided down the back, sometimes tied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolgirl ribbon</ENAMEX>. Around
        the neck hang various strands of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, a heavy golden necklace,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ribbons</ENAMEX>, a gold scapular with images of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> on both sides, and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crucifix</ENAMEX>. Much of this adornment is gold filigree, like an emprendad, a
        necklace of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> design. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> wear various heavy
        rings. The costumes are so original and ornate that a fair amount of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> is spent at each folklore show explaining them in detail. Even
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> on foot or in strollers wear a miniature version of the
        costumes.
        ‚Ä¢The meaning of each dance is recounted, but this is
        usually not easy since the origins have often been forgotten. Most of
        the dances are suggestive of ancient courtship rituals, with the man
        being forceful and arrogant, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> shyly flirtatious. In one dance,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> form a circle, moving in small steps, their eyes cast down,
        while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> perform high kicks, sticking to the outside. Often the
        songs have witty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ri¬≠bald</ENAMEX> lyrics likely to suffer fatally in impromptu
        translation.
        ‚Ä¢The music is played on typically <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Catalonian‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> in some
        cases uniquely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ibicencan‚</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇinstruments</ENAMEX>: a wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flute</ENAMEX> and a small drum
        (handled simultaneously by a single ambidextrous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>), a sort of steel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sabre</ENAMEX> struck in rhythm, and large castanets. The music appears to have
        survived fundamentally from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> culture, though over the centuries
        it has accumulated a number of extraneous elements. Some of the
        light-hearted songs require the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> to emit a weird, guttural
        ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúye-ye-ye‚Äù</NUMEX> sound.
        ‚Ä¢Making your own way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> will cost less than if
        you take an organized excursion, which includes the in- evitable
        libation of sangr√≠a.
        ‚Ä¢Festivals
        ‚Ä¢The popular fiestas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> are much less pretentious
        than the equivalent (and more famous) ferias of mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. With
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> in mind, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several feast days</TIMEX> now offer special events and
        fireworks which never featured in the original celebrations. For the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visitor</ENAMEX>, the most interesting observances are the modest old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">standbys‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇgenerally the saint‚Äôs day of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>: sombre religious
        processions, often held by candle-light, folk music, a rash of quaint
        costumes. It may not be the carnival you expected, but it can be much
        more memorable.
        ‚Ä¢Nightlife
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX> attract rich and famous media
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">celebrities</ENAMEX>, as well as virtually every other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to the area. Many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> expressly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, which run the gamut from
        plush to sleazy. Traditional audience participation in events such as
        beauty contests usually plays a part in the entertainment.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Ä¢Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> itself is not the place to go for the club
        scene, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalt Vila</ENAMEX> has a few gay bars and there is plenty of
        other entertainment available.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Ä¢The undisputed centre</ENAMEX> for nightlife on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is Sant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoni</ENAMEX>, where establishments range from big brash <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX> to the
        smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> with disc <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jockeys</ENAMEX> or live music of various
        kinds, including jazz.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Ä¢The Playa D‚ÄôEn Bossa</ENAMEX> area to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> also
        has a lively nightlife, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, live music, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer months</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discobus</ENAMEX> runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> (from
        around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:00 p.m.</TIMEX> ) to some of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>, so you don‚Äôt have to
        drive. See the box on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> for details of the current hot-spots.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> forget that many large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> offer evening
        activities <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>, and you don‚Äôt need to be a guest of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> to participate.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX>, handily located on the passeig <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mar√≠tim</ENAMEX>, is
        open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round. To gain entrance to the gaming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, you have to
        present your passport or identification papers. For a small fee, you
        will be issued a computerized admission card, which is good for one or
        more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of roulette (both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>), as well as blackjack
        and craps.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢The</ENAMEX> stakes for many of the games are low, so you can try
        your hand without risking too much. Early in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> in for a look at what‚Äôs going on, but as time wears on, the
        dyed-in-the-wool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gamblers</ENAMEX> come to the fore.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Also</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">premises</ENAMEX> are a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX> with a floor show and

        ‚Ä¢Most films in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cinemas have been dubbed into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>. Aside from the more conventional cinemas of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX>, other
        places that show films on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> are old-fashioned if not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">picturesque</ENAMEX>. Either once or twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> you can now see films in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Eul√†ria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢Eating Out
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢E‚ÄÇating</ENAMEX> and drinking in a new part of the world can be a
        pleasurable adventure. It‚Äôs somewhat more so on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> because of the
        cultural mix. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> may be from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, the cuisine advertised as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúFrench</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> may want nothing more daring than a steak.
        Thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs popularity around the world, as well as its noted
        permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX>, the variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> is
        exceptional: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Scandinavian</ENAMEX>, even <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> cooking, is
        available. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is usually quite good, though it can be a bit on
        the expensive side.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Ä¢International fare</ENAMEX> is also offered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, but if
        you venture beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> enclaves you‚Äôll be able to sample
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">authentic Spanish</ENAMEX> cuisine. Make for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX>, where tapas bars serve
        a variety of typical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> to a mostly local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clientele</ENAMEX>,
        or explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Eul√†ria</ENAMEX> area, which is renowned among Ibicencos
        for its eating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera</ENAMEX>, have a meal at a simple beach
        restaurant.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Ä¢Eating</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> is a passion with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôre not

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Spanish Specialities</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Gazpacho</ENAMEX> (pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gath-¬≠PAT-cho</ENAMEX>) is an Andalusian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invention</ENAMEX>, a highly flavoured, chilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> to which chopped cucumbers,
        peppers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>, onions, and sippets (croutons) are added to taste.
        It‚Äôs been described as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúliquid salad‚Äù</ENAMEX> and can be a rousing

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Technically</ENAMEX>, paella is served only at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX> and always

        into a bowl of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream (‚ÄÇfresas con nata</ENAMEX>), widely
        advertised by the island‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and caf√©s.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meal Times</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> are officially graded and then
        awarded a number of forks: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fork is the lowest, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> forks the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">√©lite.</ENAMEX> Note that ratings are awarded according to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, however,
        and not to the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, several forks may only guarantee
        higher prices.
        ‚Ä¢A good way to choose a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> is to have a look in
        and check how many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ibicencos</ENAMEX> and deeply tanned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expatriates</ENAMEX> are eating
        there. If a lot of these value-conscious, knowledgeable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are
        there, then chances are you‚Äôve found the right place to get a
        satisfying meal no matter what the official rating is.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> generally offer a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúday‚Äôs special‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">men√∫ del d√≠a</ENAMEX>). This is normally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> at a set
        price. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">men√∫</ENAMEX> proves economical if not inspired, since the law
        stipulates that the price charged cannot be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 80 per cent</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">the√† la carte</ENAMEX> sum of its parts. It is important to note that if a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">waiter</ENAMEX> asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúMen√∫</ENAMEX>? ,‚Äù he is referring to the special dish of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>.
        If you want to look at the actual menu and see what else is offered,
        then you should ask for ‚Äúla carta. ‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Most</ENAMEX> menu prices include taxes and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> charge, but
        it‚Äôs customary to leave a tip if you were served satisfactorily. Around
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 per cent</NUMEX> is usually the appropriate amount. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> announce
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> complaint forms are available to dissatisfied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢On the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> mainland, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late dining hours</TIMEX> perplex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. Lunch hardly ever seems to start until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:00 p.m.</TIMEX> , and dinner
        may wait till <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00 p.m.</TIMEX> However, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ibiza the</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>-and-fisherman
        tradition rules out late meals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restaurants</ENAMEX> serve <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch from 1:00 to</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:00 p.m.</TIMEX> and dinner from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 8:00 to 11:00 p.m.</TIMEX>
        ‚Ä¢One useful hint for keeping costs down: ask for vino de
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la</ENAMEX> casa (house <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit‚</ENAMEX>Äôll cost well under half the price of a brand
        wine, and offer tolerable quality into the bargain. Overall, most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> are less expensive than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Breakfast</ENAMEX>, Anyone?
        ‚Ä¢While lunch and dinner may be major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX>, the standard
        Ibizan breakfast is simply a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and a pastry.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ensaimadas‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsweet</ENAMEX> rolls made with lard‚<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare a Balearic</ENAMEX> speciality
        generally available on the island. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> you can sample churros,
        sugared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fritters</ENAMEX>, that you dip into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> or hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢In deference to foreign habits, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caf√©s</ENAMEX> now offer a desayuno completo consisting of orange juice, toast,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, either with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX>. Breakfast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> (caf√© con
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">leche</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> coffee, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Ä¢Hot chocolate</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">un suizo</ENAMEX>, meaning,
        not illogically, ‚Äúa <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>.‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Beach Restaurants</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Ä¢For drinks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX> at the water‚Äôs edge, there‚Äôs
        nothing like a beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>. These modest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> are set up
        right on the sand. Because they‚Äôre supposed to be dismantled at the end
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each season</TIMEX>, most are somewhat makeshift, but they are nonetheless
        convenient and appealingly strong on atmosphere.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Bars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√</ENAMEX>©s
        ‚Ä¢From <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX>, bars and
        caf√©s serve breakfast, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>. Open-air caf√©s are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the area‚Äôs pleasures. A cup of coffee buys you a ringside seat
        for as long as you care to linger; no one will rush you. The sole
        exception is in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>, where some caf√©s refuse to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> at
        all during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">peak hours</TIMEX>, preferring the high profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Wines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spirits</ENAMEX> are served at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all hours</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> are welcome in most bars and often accompany their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> on
        late-night outings, having recouped their energy during their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">siesta</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Bar</ENAMEX> and caf√© bills include service, but small tips are
        the custom. It usually costs <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> less to sit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> or a drink than being served at a table.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Note</ENAMEX> that cafeter√≠as aren‚Äôt self-service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> as
        you may know them, but are glorified snack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. The word originally
        meant a caf√©, but service has been expanded to include full meals at
        quite high prices.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Bodegas</ENAMEX> are ‚Äúwine cellars. ‚Äù On the mainland, many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">popular</ENAMEX> tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> have been designed to re-create the feel of a
        traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar</ENAMEX>. However, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, a bodega is usually a
        wholesale and retail wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> rather than a place to sit and try the
        vintages. Prices are reasonable here.
        ‚Ä¢Tapas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Ä¢A tapa</ENAMEX> is a bite-sized morsel of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">food‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmeatballs</ENAMEX>,
        olives, fried fish tidbits, shellfish, vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX>; it can be
        almost anything edible. The word itself, tapa, is translated as ‚Äúlid‚Äù
        and derives from the old custom of offering a bite of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> along with a
        drink, the food being served on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saucer</ENAMEX> sitting on top of the glass
        like a lid. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, sadly, the custom of giving away the tapa is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nonexistent</ENAMEX>, though the idea of selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX> is stronger than ever.
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> specialize in them. Instead of sitting down to a formal meal
        in a restaurant you can wander into a tapas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX>, point to the items you
        like and eat your way down the counter, rather like a smorgasbord.
        Usually tapas include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX>, meatballs, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad vegetables</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fried fish</ENAMEX>,
        and olives. One helping is called a porci√≥n, a large serving is a
        raci√≥n, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as much a media-raci√≥n. It pays to learn these terms, as
        it‚Äôs quite possible to spend more for tapas than for a conventional
        dinner.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Wines</ENAMEX> and Spirits
        ‚Ä¢The most famous of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> is, of course,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry</ENAMEX> (vino <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Jerez</ENAMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> fortified with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>. You will find two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal types</ENAMEX>: fino and oloroso. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fino</ENAMEX> is a dry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry</ENAMEX>, pale in colour
        with a rich bouquet. In this category belong manzanillas and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amontillados</ENAMEX>. Any fino will make a good aperitif.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢An</ENAMEX> oloroso, on the other hand, is a heavy, dark dessert
        wine, which is sweetened before being sold. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> Sherries
        are olorosos, and so is an amoroso, though it‚Äôs medium dry and pale in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colour</ENAMEX>. An oloroso is a good after-dinner drink.
        ‚Ä¢For an adequate table <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, try one of the many
        unpretentious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> that come from mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>. These
        unsung, yet worthy, vintages very often cost hardly any more than
        bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral water</ENAMEX>. In contrast, some of the well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> are overpriced and not necessarily of better quality.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢On</ENAMEX> rare occasions you may find a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> serving vino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de pag√©s</ENAMEX> (local red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Islanders</ENAMEX> often drink the somewhat acid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>
        mixed with lemonade (gaseosa).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢If</ENAMEX> you‚Äôre not in the mood for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> with your meal, have
        no qualms about ordering something else instead. No one will turn up a
        snobbish nose if you prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>, mineral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, or a soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>. In
        fact, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX> even some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ibicencos</ENAMEX> themselves consider wine
        off-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">limits‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit‚Äôs</ENAMEX> just too relaxing.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Ä¢Spanish brandy</ENAMEX> has a less delicate taste than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        Cognac, and you may find it too heavy or sweet for your liking. It‚Äôs
        very cheap, though‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇoften the same price as a soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>. An expensive
        brand like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX> I is much smoother.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Sangr√≠a</ENAMEX>, rather like punch, is a popular thirst-quenching
        refresher, especially in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Made from a mixture of red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, lemon
        and orange juice and peel, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral water</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, it may
        strike you as too heavy to be consumed with a meal. Whenever you do try
        it, make certain it‚Äôs freshly made.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Ä¢A</ENAMEX> word about prices. If you insist on sticking to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imported Scotch</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon</ENAMEX>, expect to pay a relative fortune. However,
        a wide range of familiar liquors and liqueurs are available at very low
        prices made under licence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. A visit to a large liquor store
        will reveal prices startlingly lower than what you‚Äôd pay at home.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Ibiza</ENAMEX> is mildly famous for its own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native liqueurs</ENAMEX>. The
        most widely seen is hierbas (which means, literally, herbs). This sweet
        and fairly mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">potion</ENAMEX> is by and large a homemade product that is
        blended with herbs and sold in old bottles. It costs less, and may
        taste better, in the remote areas. The syrupy hierbas (YAIR-bass) may
        be sipped before or after meals. In hot weather, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> drink it
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Frigola</ENAMEX>, a sweet, digestive drink good with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>, is
        commercially bottled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibiza</ENAMEX> from formulas using island-grown herbs.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> aromatic aniseed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> are also produced locally. Beware though,
        since these colourless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquids</ENAMEX> have a considerable kick. An√≠s dulce is
        sweet; an√≠s seco, dry and dangerously potent. It resembles French
        pastis, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> ouzo, or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">raki</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ibizans</ENAMEX> like their an√≠s neat
        (straight). Foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">imbibers</ENAMEX>, not brought up on this custom, usually
        prefer to dilute it with a large splash of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo</ENAMEX>, a slightly
        bitter aniseed drink dark brown in colour, tastes best in a long tall
        glass with the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>.
