        For many years <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> of internal contrasts ‚Äî
        between the more urban and industrial north and the rural south,
        between the intellectual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> and the largely agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX>,
        between chic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and the less sophisticated provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> ‚Äî and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> that saw itself as standing alone, distinct from all others.
        Much has changed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent times</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> is no longer the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate</ENAMEX> mecca for ambitious young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> from the prov¬≠inces; cities
        around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are attracting young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> who want to
        escape the more frenetic life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ile de France</ENAMEX>; the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agricultural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> has shrunk dramatically; industrial and high-tech
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX> have sprung up around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>; provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are
        developing their own international reputations; and immigration and
        increasing migration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> within a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúborder-free‚Äù Euro¬≠pean</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> are blurring the edges of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> identity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> remains, however, a splendid and individualist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that has much to offer to the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ‚Äî despite occasional rumors to the contrary ‚Äî welcome tourists
        and are eager to show off their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, their way of life, their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">traditions</ENAMEX>, and their beliefs; in short, their essential joie de vivre.
        They are proud of their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> and have a right to be.
        Quality of life remains their paramount preoccupation. It is
        no accident that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> are best known for their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>,
        their clothes and perfumes, their dashing art and monumental
        architecture. Their love of perfection serves them well.
        Give <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and they won‚Äôt just boil
        them, fry them, or make an omelette (all of which they‚Äôre quite
        prepared to do superlatively) ‚Äî they feel obliged to produce a delicate
        souffl√© or a rich hollandaise <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> that makes an egg proud to be an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX>. Even a lowly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">croque-monsieur</ENAMEX> is a world away from a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> and cheese
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX>. You will still find the elegant, spare plates of ¬≠nouvelle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cuisine</ENAMEX>, but there is a new focus on heartier dishes and an acceptance
        of cuisines of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> attention to detail is found in all walks of life
        ‚Äî from the way a scarf is tied to the planning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> flow¬≠er
        displays found in small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> (national prizes for the prettiest
        village are hotly contested).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is blessed with an astonishing variety of landscapes:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">long</ENAMEX>, high dunes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Coast</ENAMEX>; craggy coves in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brittany</ENAMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burgundy</ENAMEX>; steep gorges in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarn</ENAMEX>; olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, umbrella pines and cypresses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Provence</ENAMEX>; and lazy beaches
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAzur. All these are as typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> as the more
        conventional images of rolling green meadows bounded by straggling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hedgerows</ENAMEX> and arrow-straight avenues lined with plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, a village
        visible on the horizon, clustered around its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is a veritable compendium of geography. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">plains</ENAMEX> and plateaus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picardy</ENAMEX> in the north and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alsace</ENAMEX> to the east lend
        themselves to large-scale agriculture before ending in the gentler,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rolling</ENAMEX> green fields of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy</ENAMEX> to the west and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX> of
        Burgundy that herald the beginnings of the south.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps of Savoie</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dauphin√© peter</ENAMEX> out in the rugged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">little Alpilles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provence</ENAMEX>. The formidable barrier of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyr√</ENAMEX>©n√©es
        forms the frontier with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
        With these mountain ranges protecting the eastern and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> frontiers, the mild <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> winds penetrate deep inland,
        bringing with them all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and sun needed for a highly productive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agriculture</ENAMEX>, while avoiding the extremes of a continental climate.
        Inland from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast ‚</ENAMEX>Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquitaine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dordogne</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P√©rigord ‚</ENAMEX>Äî the southwest is rich in farming and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs the
        land of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goose</ENAMEX>, of fine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bordeaux</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. Pointing out into
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> on the country‚Äôs western edge, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brittany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs spectacular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shoreline</ENAMEX> has earned the region a reputation for rough weather. In fact
        it enjoys the mildest of climates, even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, and provides many a
        pleasant seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and counts and feudal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lords</ENAMEX> have gone from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loire Valley</ENAMEX> and the forests and marshes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sologne</ENAMEX>, but the hunting
        and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> remains. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">country‚Äôs heart</ENAMEX>, slightly north of
        the geographical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> nestles in a basin ideal for industrial
        and commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX>, comfortably surrounded by the forest and
        farmland of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ile-de</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Champagne area</ENAMEX> lies conveniently
        to the east to help celebrate its successes.
        If the land itself is the most obvious source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pride</ENAMEX>, the nation‚Äôs cultural wealth is just as important. Philosophy
        and the fine arts do not intimidate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> as something to be
        confined to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">√©lite</ENAMEX>. For most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù is not the
        dirty word it seems to be in so many other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. Museums are as
        popular as sports ¬≠stadiums, and crowds flock to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> and music
        festivals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Even
        popular arts such as advertising, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>, comic strips, and fashion
        are elevated to the level of high culture, with their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">festivals</ENAMEX>.
        An active government cultural policy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> has
        ¬≠preserved the architectural monuments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúnational patrimony‚Äù</ENAMEX> from
        the ravages of time, weather, war, revolution, and urban development.
        Through¬≠out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, partly in preparation for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">2000 Millennium</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">celebrations</ENAMEX>, fa√ßades were scrubbed and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> generally
        refurbished. Innovative use has been made of outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for
        summer festivals, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins and medieval monasteries. In
        addition to recorded commentaries, you will find bright young art
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> who are enthusiastic about the places where they work and
        their areas of knowledge. Their descriptions are fresh and informative,
        and they‚Äôre glad to answer questions that go beyond the brochure or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidebook</ENAMEX>. Many important monuments are beautifully lit at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>,
        making city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> treat.
        While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> is still a major destination for sightseers,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> should not ignore the charms of such provincial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">towns</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lyon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montpellier, Rouen</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Strasbourg</ENAMEX>. All feature a blend
        of ancient and modern, of dignity and fun, and strive to make the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> feel welcome and treasured.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> offers plenty of outdoor enjoyment, too:
        swimming and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports, or just sunbathing, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine</ENAMEX> lakes,
        on the beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normandy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX>, or at the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAzur; first-class skiing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pyr√©n√©es</ENAMEX>; canoeing
        down spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">gorges</ENAMEX>; and marvelous hiking around the country‚Äôs
        national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and nature reserves. Evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is far from
        being a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of hidebound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">highbrows</ENAMEX> is the fact that the Marne
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX>, east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, was selected for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Europe‚Äôs first‚ÄÇDisneyland</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> is internationally acknowledged to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> in
        high technology and is happy to share its pride in these advances. With
        its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">G√©ode</ENAMEX> entertainment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cit√© des Sciences et de</ENAMEX>
        l‚ÄôIndustrie in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Villette</ENAMEX>, on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, attracts science
        buffs young and old. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cit√© de l‚</ENAMEX>ÄôEspace in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toulouse</ENAMEX> is dominated by a
        replica of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ariane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rocket</ENAMEX>. Even if you don‚Äôt get on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">high-speed TGV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>, you are almost certain to see one zoom past.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are as varied as their landscape, but don‚Äôt let
        anyone tell you the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> national clich√© is a myth. The red-nosed,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mustachioed</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> with a beret on his head, a crumpled cigarette
        drooping from his lip, and a long baguette or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> under his arm
        certainly does exist and can be seen in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. But
        there‚Äôs all the difference in the world between the prudent,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">close-mouthed Norman</ENAMEX> and the vociferous, easy-going <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proven√ßal</ENAMEX>, between
        the pious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breton</ENAMEX> and the pagan sophisticate of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>.
        For a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> so fiercely proud of their identity, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> are a rich mixture. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Picardy</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> influence is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unmistakable</ENAMEX>, and although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alsace</ENAMEX> may celebrate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Bastille Day</TIMEX> at least
        as proudly as any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, and
        dialect all reveal a profoundly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germanic</ENAMEX> influence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¥te</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôAzur and
        Corsica both have a distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> flavor, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the
        northern slopes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pyr√©n√©es</ENAMEX> are not so very different from their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousins</ENAMEX> to the south.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> has always been a haven for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. Not by
        accident did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Ernst</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chagall</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> to make their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest poets of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilhelm</ENAMEX>
        Kostrowitsky, better known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guillaume Apollinaire</ENAMEX>, was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irishman Samuel Beckett</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">happily</ENAMEX> wrote plays in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenzo, Lagerfeld</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cerruti</ENAMEX> design
        in the international but inexorably <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>-based language of haute
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">couture</ENAMEX>.
        Despite occasional tensions, perhaps inevitable in times of
        economic uncertainty, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> increasingly recognize that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France‚</ENAMEX>Äôs d√©partements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Indies</ENAMEX> and from
        former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies ‚Äî Algeria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tunisia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> ‚Äî enrich the national
        culture and add spice to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">country‚Äôs cuisine</ENAMEX>. And as the European
        Union matures, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> are taking advantage of opportunities to live
        and work in different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are buying <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> ‚Äî
        or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> ‚Äî <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are choosing to settle
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> for a time. It all makes for a wonderful and
        exciting mix, adding to that greatest of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> assets ‚Äî a vibrant and
        varied street scene.
        For the first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> will seem at once
        delightfully different and comfortably familiar, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of exciting
        and infinitely attractive contrasts.
