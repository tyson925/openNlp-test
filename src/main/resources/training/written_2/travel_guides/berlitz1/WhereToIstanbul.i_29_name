        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M odern Istanbul</ENAMEX>, a sprawling metropolis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>, is split in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> by the narrow, sinuous strait
        known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>. The historic heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> lies on a small
        peninsula at the south end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saray Burnu</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seraglio Point</ENAMEX>. This easily defensible thumb of land is bounded on
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚ÄúThree Seas‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Sea of Marmara</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> to the east, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> to the north. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old City</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stamboul</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eski Istanbul</ENAMEX>, spreads across seven
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hills</ENAMEX> and is home to the city‚Äôs richest historic treasures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇHaghia
        Sophia, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covered Bazaar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Mosque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ± Palace</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√ºleymaniye Mosque</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of St. Saviour</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chora</ENAMEX>.
        The new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Bridge</ENAMEX> spans the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX>,
        linking <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Istanbul to the ‚ÄúNew City‚Äù of Beyo‚Äòlu</ENAMEX>. Here you will find
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Tower</ENAMEX>, the stylish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, trendy caf√©s, and
        luxurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istiklal Caddesi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taksim Square</ENAMEX>, and the
        sumptuous splendour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dolmabah√ße Palace</ENAMEX>.
        Ferries cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">√úsk√</NUMEX>ºdar, and ply the length
        of the scenic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX>, past such pretty fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnavutk√∂y</ENAMEX>,
        Kanlƒ±ca, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tarabya</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emirgan</ENAMEX>, and offering good views of the great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">for¬≠tress of Rumeli Hisarƒ±</ENAMEX>. To the south, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Marmara</ENAMEX>, lie
        the woods and beaches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Princes‚Äô Islands</ENAMEX>.
        The Old <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">City‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇStamboul
        Istanbul‚Äôs most popular tourist attractions are concentrated
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sultanahmet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, near the tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saray Burnu</ENAMEX> peninsula,
        and are all within easy walking distance of each other. A new tram line
        runs from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sirkeci</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Bridge</ENAMEX>, through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sultanahmet</ENAMEX>, past
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covered Bazaar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laleli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aksaray</ENAMEX>, and on to the
        city walls at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ±</ENAMEX> bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> (not to be confused with the famous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX> of the same name). The outlying sights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Saviour</ENAMEX> in Chora
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yedikule</ENAMEX> are best reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sultanahmet</ENAMEX> District
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sultanahmet</ENAMEX> district occupies the summit of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of
        the Old City‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hills. This was the site of the original
        Byzantium, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX> b.c. , and of the civic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centre of Constantinople</ENAMEX>, capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. Here, too,
        the conquering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sultans</ENAMEX> chose to build their most magnificent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">palaces</ENAMEX> and mosques. Of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the most
        remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayasofya</ENAMEX>)
        For nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> was the
        greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Christendom</ENAMEX>, an architectural wonder built by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Byzantine Empire</ENAMEX> to impress the world.
        It is thought that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christ¬</ENAMEX>≠ian basilica was built here in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">a.d. 325</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine</ENAMEX>, on the site of a pagan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. It
        was destroyed by fire in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a.d. 404</ENAMEX> and rebuilt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodosius II</ENAMEX>, then
        burnt down again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">532</TIMEX>. The building you see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> was commissioned by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justinian</ENAMEX> and completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">537</TIMEX>, although many repairs, additions, and
        alterations have been made over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> was damaged by
        earthquakes several times, and the supporting buttresses have coarsened
        the church‚Äôs outward appearance.
        The finest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> were used in its construction‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhite
        marble from the islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marmara</ENAMEX>, verd antique from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thessaly</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> yellow marble, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ephesus</ENAMEX>, and ancient red
        porphyry columns that possibly came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and may once have stood
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baalbek</ENAMEX>. The interior was covered with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> mosaics, lit by countless flickering candelabras.
        The last <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> ever to be held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haghia</ENAMEX> Sophia
        took place on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 May 1453</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantinople</ENAMEX> finally fell
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>. Mehmet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conqueror</ENAMEX> immediately converted the building
        to an imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, and built a brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">minaret</ENAMEX> at the southeast
        corner. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sinan</ENAMEX>, strengthened the buttresses and added the
        other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> minarets during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was last
        renovated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1840s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> served as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX>,
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atat√ºrk</ENAMEX> proclaimed that it should become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
        The entrance path leads past the ticket desk to a shady
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>-garden outside the main portal, which is surrounded by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">architectural frag¬≠¬≠ments</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth-century</TIMEX> church built by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theodosius</ENAMEX>; an excavated area to the left of the door reveals a part of
        this earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. You enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> through the
        central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">portal</ENAMEX>, across a worn and well polished threshold of verd
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antique</ENAMEX>, and under a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosaic</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ Pantocrator</ENAMEX>, into
        the long, narrow narthex, running to right and left. Note the beautiful
        matching panels of marble, and the vaulted gold mosaic ceiling. As you
        continue through the huge bronze doors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Gate</ENAMEX>, your eyes
        will be drawn skywards by the upwards sweep of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>. It is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 31</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metres</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 feet</NUMEX>) in diameter, and stands <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">180 feet</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">high‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe same as a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-storey</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> of space is created by the absence of
        supporting walls beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>; it rests instead upon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> great
        arches, which in turn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> massive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">piers</ENAMEX>. The arches that
        flank the nave are filled with tiers of columns and the walls with
        windows, while the arches above the entrance and the apse are backed by
        semi-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>, further increasing the interior space. It was the great
        achievement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isidorus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthemius</ENAMEX>, to
        transfer the weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> to the pillars using arches and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúpendentives</ENAMEX>,‚Äù the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> triangular sections of masonry that fill the
        gaps between arches and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, to create the illusion of an unsupported
        dome floating in space. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justinian</ENAMEX> was so overwhelmed by the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sight of what his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> had achieved that he cried out,
        ‚ÄúGlory be to God that I have been judged worthy of such a work! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX>, I have surpassed you! ‚Äù
        The original decoration has long since disappeared. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX>
        huge medallions, bearing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> names of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
        his grandsons, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> caliphs, and a quotation from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koran</ENAMEX> in the crown of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, are remnants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of service as an imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, as are the elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mihrab</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mimber</ENAMEX> in the apse. But a few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> mosaics survive‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇabove the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apse</ENAMEX> is the Virgin with the infant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archangel Gabriel</ENAMEX> to
        the right (his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX>, to the left, has vanished save for a
        few feathers from his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX>).
        The best mosaics are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, reached by a spiral
        ramp at the north end of the narthex. By the south wall is the famous
        Deesis, an extraordinary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> mosaic showing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> flanked by
        the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John the Baptist</ENAMEX>. On the east wall are two
        images showing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> emperors and emperesses making offerings to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> on his throne (to the left), and to the Virgin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX>.
        At the east end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small columns and a
        circle of green marble mark the spot where the empress sat during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX>; on the floor of the nave below, a circle of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coloured stone</ENAMEX> to
        the right of centre is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Opus Alexandrinum</ENAMEX>, the place where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> emperors were crowned. Retrace your steps down the ramp and
        through the first door on your left. In front of you is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weeping</ENAMEX>
        Column, or the Column of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory</ENAMEX>, which has a thumb-sized hole
        covered with a brass plate. If you insert a finger, it comes out
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">damp‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe moisture</ENAMEX> is known to have miraculous healing powers,
        especially for eye <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        As you leave by the door at the south end of the narthex,
        turn round and look up above the door to see a beautiful <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX>
        mosaic of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> and empress offering symbols of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX> to the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ± Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ± Sarayƒ±</ENAMEX>)
        Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> and the tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saray Burnu</ENAMEX> stretches
        the walled enclosure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ± Palace</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> and seat
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> sultans. Begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1462</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet</ENAMEX> the
        Conqueror, it was enlarged and extended by each succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> until
        it became a miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which included mosques, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, stables,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kit¬≠chens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mint</ENAMEX>, treasuries, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>, armouries,
        government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and audience <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>. At its height it supported a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 4,000</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan Abd√ºl Mecit</ENAMEX> moved into the newly built <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dol</ENAMEX>-mabah√ße
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1853</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>), and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ±</ENAMEX> was completely
        abandoned. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1924</TIMEX> it was converted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and has been
        undergoing a continuous programme of restoration ever since. It is the
        city‚Äôs most popular tourist attraction, and deserves <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full day</TIMEX> to do
        it justice. If pushed for time, the ‚Äúmust-sees‚Äù are, in order of
        importance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pavilion</ENAMEX> of the Holy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mantle</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is laid out as a series of courtyards linked by
        ceremonial gates. You enter through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Gate</ENAMEX> (built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1478</TIMEX>)
        into the wooded gardens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Court</ENAMEX>. On the left is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Eirene</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Divine Peace</ENAMEX>), rebuilt together with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> after being burnt down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">532</TIMEX> (closed to the public).
        This area was also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of the Janissaries</ENAMEX>, after the
        crack military corps that served as the sultan‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodyguard</ENAMEX> and used it
        as an assembly ground while on duty at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> (the name derives
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yeni √ßeri</ENAMEX>, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúnew army‚Äù</ENAMEX>). It originally
        contained the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace bakery</ENAMEX>, the armoury, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mint</ENAMEX>. At the far
        right-hand corner is the ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>, which originally served as a
        prison. The fountain is called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Executioner‚Äôs Fountain</ENAMEX>, because here
        he rinsed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> and washed his hands after carrying out his orders;
        examples of his handiwork were displayed on pikes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX>
        Gate.
        Buy your ticket and pass through the turreted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate</ENAMEX> of
        Salutations, better known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orta Kapƒ±</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Gate</ENAMEX>. Only the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sultan</ENAMEX> was permitted to ride through this gate on horseback; all others
        had to dismount and bow. It leads into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Court</ENAMEX>, also known as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of the Divan</ENAMEX>, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Council</ENAMEX> (known as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Divan</ENAMEX>) governed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> from here. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues radiate</ENAMEX> from
        the inside of the gate. To the right lie the enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace Kitchens</ENAMEX>,
        which house a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crystal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>,
        Ottoman serving dishes, and cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">im¬≠ple¬≠¬≠ments</ENAMEX>. Straight ahead is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ornate Gate of the White Eunuchs</ENAMEX>, which leads into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Court</ENAMEX>,
        and the private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> on the left leads
        towards the pointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Divan Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Divan Kulesi</ENAMEX>), at the foot of which
        lie the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council Chamber</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Vezir‚Äôs Office</ENAMEX>. Here, too, is the
        entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ±‚</ENAMEX>Äôs main attraction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX> housed the private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX>, his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother</ENAMEX>, and his many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> and concubines. Its dim network of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">staircases</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corridors</ENAMEX>, and courtyards linked the sumptuously decorated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chambers</ENAMEX> of the royal household, and harboured a claustrophobic world
        of ambition, jealousy, and intrigue. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX>, open from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00 a.m. to</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:00 p.m.</TIMEX> , can be visited only on the official <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> guided tour
        (offered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and other languages), for which you must buy an
        additional ticket. Try to get there early, as tours sell out quickly on
        busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. The ticket will be stamped with the time your tour begins,
        which may be immediately, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> later‚<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇask</ENAMEX> when you buy. The
        tours are rushed, and the route may vary due to restoration work.
        You enter by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Carriage Gate</ENAMEX>, where, on the rare
        occasions they were permitted outside, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> moun¬≠ted their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carriages</ENAMEX>. The only adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> allowed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>
        Eunuchs, who were in charge of security and administration. Their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quarters</ENAMEX> opened off the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Courtyard</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Eunuchs</ENAMEX>, beyond
        the gate. Windows in the colonnade on the left give a glimpse of their
        tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>; sticks hanging on the walls were used to beat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">miscreants</ENAMEX> on
        the soles of their feet, a mandatory punishment for all novices.
        A long, narrow corridor lined with shelves (for trays of
        food) leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Courtyard of the Women Servants</ENAMEX>, from which you
        enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Apartments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Valide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> (the sultan‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, who was
        the most powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX>). Her domed Sitting Room is
        panelled with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">K√ºtahya tiles</ENAMEX>, and decor¬≠ated with scenic
        views. A raised platform framed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> columns contains divans and a
        low dining table. The door on the left, beyond the hearth, leads to the
        valide sultan‚Äôs bedchamber, with a gilded bed canopy and ornate floral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fa√Øence</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX>, blue, and red. A small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">adjoining prayer room</ENAMEX> has
        scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medina</ENAMEX>.
        The right-hand door leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Apartments of the Sultan</ENAMEX>
        himself. First you pass the entrance to the royal bath <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX>,
        designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinan</ENAMEX> and richly ornamented in marble. There are paired but
        separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> and the valide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX>, each having a
        changing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, a cool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, and a hot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> was bathed by
        elderly female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX>, then dried and pampered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of younger
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handmaidens</ENAMEX>.
        Next, you enter the vast and splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Hall</ENAMEX>, with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> handsome marble fountains, and a canopied throne from which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sultan</ENAMEX> would enjoy the music and dancing of his concubines. The valide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sultan</ENAMEX> and the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> sat on sofas under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> to the left,
        while the more talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave-girls</ENAMEX> played music from the balcony
        above.
        Perhaps the most splendid of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Salon</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murat III</ENAMEX>, with inlaid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>, flowered Iznik tiles of the best period,
        carved fountains, canopied sofas, and a superb domed ceiling, designed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinan</ENAMEX>. On the far side a door leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library of Ahmet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, with
        cupboard doors and shutters inlaid with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-of-pearl and
        tortoiseshell, which in turn opens into the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmet III</ENAMEX>,
        better known simply as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruit Room</ENAMEX>. This tiny, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>-panelled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is
        covered all over with lacquered paintings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> in
        rococo style. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmet III</ENAMEX> was known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúTulip King</ENAMEX>,‚Äù and celebrated
        each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> with a tulip festival in the palace grounds.
        The exit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX> opens into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Third Court</ENAMEX>,
        otherwise reached through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate of the White Eunuchs</ENAMEX>. Immediately
        inside the gate is the richly decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Throne Room</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arz Odasƒ±</ENAMEX>), where
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> received foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassadors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> down to the right to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, whose chief attractions are the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">golden Topkapƒ± Dagger</ENAMEX>,
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> huge emeralds set in the hilt, and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> forming the lid
        of a watch hidden in the handle; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Spoonmaker‚Äôs Diamond</ENAMEX>, an
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">86-carat</NUMEX>, pear-shaped diamond set in a gold mount encrusted with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>
        smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>. Other exhibits include gilded thrones studded with
        precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, a pair of solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candlesticks</ENAMEX> set with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">666</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX> (one for each verse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koran</ENAMEX>), and reliquaries containing
        the hand and part of the skull of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John the Baptist</ENAMEX>.
        Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is the magnificently decorated
        Pa¬≠vilion of the Holy Mantle, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> sacred relics of the Prophet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX>, and is therefore a place of great religious importance for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth Court</ENAMEX> contains a number of pretty pavilions and
        terraces, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> with fine views of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ± Museums</ENAMEX>
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ±‚Äôs First Court</ENAMEX>, a narrow cobbled lane leads to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifth Court</ENAMEX>, which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkeoloji M√ºzesi</ENAMEX>) has been expanded to include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">galleries</ENAMEX> devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyprus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phrygians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palaeolithic</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iron Age</ENAMEX>. Its main
        attraction, however, is the magnificent collection of sarcophagi,
        especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Sarcophagus</ENAMEX>, decorated with scenes of hunting
        and battle.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of the Ancient Orient</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eski</ENAMEX> ¬ªark Eserleri
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M√ºzesi</ENAMEX>) displays objects from ancient Near and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX>
        civilizations, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Babylonian</ENAMEX> ceramic panels from the time of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Nebuchadnezzar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">605‚Äì 562 b.c.</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hittite</ENAMEX> stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>, and clay
        tablets bearing the earliest known examples of writing (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2700 b.c.</ENAMEX> ),
        and the oldest recorded set of laws, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Code</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hammurabi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1750 b.c.</ENAMEX>
        ).
        Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1472</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet the Conqueror</ENAMEX>, and decorated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX> and blue tile, the most eye-catching <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">build¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠ing</ENAMEX> in the
        square is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiled Kiosk</ENAMEX> (√áinili <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K√∂sk√º</ENAMEX>). It houses a valuable display
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX> ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seljuk</ENAMEX> times to the present.
        Hippodrome
        The long, narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> stretching southwest from Haghia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sophia</ENAMEX> is known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX> (At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meydanƒ±</ENAMEX>), and in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> times
        that‚Äôs exactly what it was. Inspired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circus Maximus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, it
        was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 203</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> for chariot-<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">racing</ENAMEX> and other public
        events. Later it was enlarged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine the Great</ENAMEX>, eventually
        measuring <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400 metres long by 120 metres</NUMEX> wide (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,300 feet by 400 feet</NUMEX>),
        and could hold an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</NUMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX> was the setting for the ceremony which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proclaimed Constantinople</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúNew Rome‚Äù in a.d. 330</ENAMEX>, following the
        division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, and soon became the civic centre of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> capital, decorated with imposing monuments and flanked by
        fine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately it was destroyed when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was sacked
        during the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fourth Crusade</ENAMEX>, and left stripped of its statues and marble
        seats. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> its ruins were used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarry</ENAMEX> for the
        building of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Mosque</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>). Only its outline, a few
        brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vaults</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fine ancient monuments survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
        The north end of the spina, or central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">axis</ENAMEX>, is now marked
        by an ornate domed ablutions fountain, given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaiser Wilhelm II</ENAMEX> to commemorate his visit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX>. At the opposite end
        rise the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> remnants of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Obelisk</ENAMEX>, brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Constantinople</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodosius</ENAMEX> in a.d.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">390</NUMEX>, had been commissioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">pharaoh Thut¬≠mose III</ENAMEX> in the 16th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> b.c. What you see is only the top <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of the original‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit
        broke during shipment. The reliefs on the pedestal show <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theodosius</ENAMEX> and
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX> (on the side opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serpentine</ENAMEX>
        Column) presiding over the raising of the obelisk.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serpentine Column</ENAMEX> consists of three intertwined bronze
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX>; they originally supported a gold vase, but the snakes‚Äô heads
        and the vase have long since disappeared. It is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        monument in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX>, commemorating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> victory over the Persians
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plataea</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">479 b.c.</TIMEX> (it was brought here from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delphi</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine</ENAMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, deeply eroded stone obelisk is known as the
        Column of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine Porphyrogenitus</ENAMEX>, as an inscription on its base
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> of that name (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 913‚Äì959</ENAMEX>) had it restored
        and sheathed in gilded bronze plates.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> minarets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Mosque</ENAMEX> dominate the skyline of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX>. Known in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmet Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan Ahmet</ENAMEX>), it was built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1609 and 1616</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmet</ENAMEX>
        I, after which it became the city‚Äôs principal imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> because
        of its proximity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sultan‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topkapƒ±</ENAMEX>. To savour the full
        effect of the architect‚Äôs skill, enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> through the gate
        which opens onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX>. As you pass through the portal, the
        fa√ßade sweeps up in front of you in a fine crescendo of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>. (Go out
        through the door on the left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> to reach the entrance for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> which leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> proper. )
        Once inside, you will see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> earned its
        familiar name. The very air seems to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">blue‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmore</ENAMEX> than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">turquoise Iznik</ENAMEX> tiles glow gently in the light from the mosque‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX>
        windows, decorated with lilies, carnations, tulips, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
        massive columns support a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 feet</NUMEX>) in diameter, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metres</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">142 feet</NUMEX>) high at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">crown‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbig</ENAMEX>, but not quite as big as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>, the design of which obviously influenced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>.
        The mihrab and mimber are of delicately carved white marble, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ebony</ENAMEX> window shutters are inlaid with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-of-pearl. The
        painted blue arabesques in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> and upper walls are restorations;
        to see the original version, look at the wall beneath the sultan‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">loge</ENAMEX>.
        Across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippodrome</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Mosque</ENAMEX> is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Arts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√</ENAMEX>ºrk ve <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam Eserleri M√ºzesi</ENAMEX>). The
        collection, housed in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibrahim Pa¬´a</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son-in-law</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>ºleyman the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnificent</ENAMEX>, includes illuminated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korans</ENAMEX>, inlaid Koran
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boxes</ENAMEX>, antique carpets, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> miniatures. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">ethnographic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> has tableaux of a nomad tent, a yurt, a village
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX>, and a traditional carpet loom, with explanations of the natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dyes</ENAMEX> used to colour the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX>.
        Across the tram lines from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> lies the entrance
        to one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul‚</ENAMEX>Äôs more unusual historic sights‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> Yerebatan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarayƒ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Underground Palace</ENAMEX>). This amazing construction is actually an
        underground cistern, one of many that once stored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> supply. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aqueducts</ENAMEX> brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade Forest</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">north</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, to the cisterns, where it was held in reserve in the
        event the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was besieged. The cistern measures <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">140 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">460 feet</NUMEX>)
        by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">70 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">230 feet</NUMEX>); its vaulted brick roof is supported by a
        forest of columns topped by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Corinthian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">336</NUMEX> in all, set in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>
        rows of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>. As you peer into the dripping gloom, you can marvel at the
        fact that it still stands, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,500 years</TIMEX> after it was built.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central District</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> with the tram lines that lead uphill from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sultanahmet</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Divan Yolu</ENAMEX>) was, and still is, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leading to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> gates in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> times. The next tram <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stop</ENAMEX> is
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">√áemberlita¬´</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooped Column</ENAMEX>), after the stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pillar</ENAMEX> that rises
        to the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. Also called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Burnt Column</ENAMEX>, it was charred
        and cracked by a great fire that ravaged the district in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1770</TIMEX> (the iron
        hoops help to reinforce the column). Constantine erected it in a.d. 330
        to mark the city‚Äôs new status as capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Roman Empire</ENAMEX>.
        Parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> and the nails with which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> was crucified are
        reputed to be sealed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">column‚Äôs base</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Bazaar</ENAMEX>
        Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Burnt Column rises the Baroque exterior of the</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuruosmaniye Camii</ENAMEX> (built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX>). Walk towards it, then turn left
        through an arched gate into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque precinct</ENAMEX>, and follow the crowds
        into the bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Bazaar</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kapalƒ± √áar¬´ƒ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covered Market</ENAMEX>) of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> is the world‚Äôs largest covered bazaar, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>,
        as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, caf√©s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, mosques, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>,
        crammed together in a grid of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX> narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that total <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) in length‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇall protected from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> sun and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> by a
        multitude of domed and vaulted roofs. Mehmet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conqueror</ENAMEX> built the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> covered market on this site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1461</TIMEX>. It has been rebuilt several
        times after destruction by fire and earthquake, most recently in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>,
        and again, to a lesser degree, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>.
        It is fairly easy to find your way, as most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
        follow a pattern and are well signposted. From the Nuruosmaniye
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entrance</ENAMEX>, stretching towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beyazƒ±t Gate</ENAMEX>, is the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>,
        lined with jewellers‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. On your right is the entrance to the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandal Bedesten</ENAMEX>, with lovely brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vaults</ENAMEX> supported on
        massive stone pillars. It is quiet and empty for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>, but
        comes alive during the auctions held here at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:00 p.m.</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wednesdays</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thursdays</ENAMEX>. In the centre of the bazaar is the Old
        Bedesten, where you can find the best quality gold and silver
        jewellery, brass and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> ware, curios, and antiques (the most
        precious goods were traditionally kept in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bedesten</ENAMEX>, as it can be
        locked securely).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beyazƒ±t Gate</ENAMEX>, at the far end of the main street
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalpakcƒ±lar Ba¬´ƒ± Caddesi</ENAMEX>), leads to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of vegetable and flower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stalls</ENAMEX>. Turn right, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> left up the stairs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Book Market</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sahaflar √áar¬´ƒ±sƒ±</ENAMEX>), a shady retreat and popular place for university
        folk. There is a selection of English books, including many titles
        devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> history, art, and architecture.
        Beyazƒ±t
        Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Book Market</ENAMEX> lies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beyazƒ±t Meydanƒ±</ENAMEX>, a vast,
        pigeon-thronged <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> below the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul University</ENAMEX>. Over
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> the square hosts a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flea</ENAMEX> market, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> lay out a
        variety of new and second-hand goods. Old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> sell bags of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> for you
        to feed to the pigeons, while brightly dressed water-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> tout for
        business with cries of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúbuz gibi</ENAMEX>! <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù (‚Äúice</ENAMEX>-cold! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX> ), and encourage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> to take a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">photograph‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfor</ENAMEX> a fee, of course.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is dominated by the beautiful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beyazƒ±t Camii</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 16th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beyazƒ±t II</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">son of Mehmet the Conqueror</ENAMEX>. It is the earliest surviving example of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">classical Ottoman</ENAMEX> architecture, inspired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX> (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>). Opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> is the arched gateway to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul University</ENAMEX>
        and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-metre (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">148-foot</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beyazƒ±t Tower</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1828</TIMEX> as a
        fire-lookout point.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>ºleymaniye
        The outline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√ºleymaniye</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque of S√</ENAMEX>ºleyman the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magnificent</ENAMEX>, rises from a site above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> (near the north
        gate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul University</ENAMEX>). Deemed the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in
        Istanbul, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> is a tribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúGolden Age‚</ENAMEX>Äù of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, and to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> who created it‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇSultan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">S√ºleyman I, the Magnificent</ENAMEX>, and his chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sinan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√ºleyman</ENAMEX>,
        known in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kanuni</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Lawgiver</ENAMEX>), reigned from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1520 to 1566</TIMEX>,
        during which period the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> attained the height of its wealth and
        power.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√ºleymaniye</ENAMEX> and its extensive complex of attendant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> was built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1550 and 1557</TIMEX>, a task that employed around
        5,300 labourers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> from Persia
        were ground up and mixed in with the mortar for one of the minarets,
        and that the incredible acoustics were achieved by embedding 64 hollow
        clay vessels facing neck-down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>. It is also said that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√ºleyman</ENAMEX>, in awe of his architect‚Äôs achievement, handed the keys to
        Sinan at the inauguration ceremony and allowed him the privilege of
        opening it.
        You enter through a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, colonnaded with grand
        columns of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX>, marble, and porphyry, with a rectangular ¬´adƒ±rvan
        (ablutions fountain) in the centre. The interior is vast and inspiring,
        flooded with light from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> stained-glass windows. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosque</ENAMEX> is square in plan, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 58</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">172 feet</NUMEX>) on a side, capped
        by a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">271‚ÅÑ2</TIMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">82 feet</NUMEX>) in diameter and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">140 feet</NUMEX>)
        high. The tiles are original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iznik</ENAMEX> fa√Øence, with floral designs; the
        woodwork of the doors and shutters is delicately inlaid with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mother-of-pearl</ENAMEX>.
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√ºleyman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinan</ENAMEX> (the latter lived to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 100</NUMEX>)
        are buried nearby. The tombs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roxelana</ENAMEX> lie
        behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in the walled garden, an atmospheric spot, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> and hollyhocks tangle among the tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> between the
        gravestones, and flocks of sparrows swoop and squabble in the fig
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Sinan‚Äôs modest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>, which he designed himself, stands in a
        triangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> at the northern corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, capped by a
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>.
        A walk around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, which affords
        a fine view across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX>, will give you some idea of the huge
        size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. You can also look up at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> magnificent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minarets</ENAMEX> said to signify that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√ºleyman</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> to reign
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> balconies remind us that he was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> dynasty.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Outer Stamboul</ENAMEX>
        There are a number of worthwhile sights between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√ºleymaniye</ENAMEX> and the city walls, but they are scattered and you will
        want to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxis</ENAMEX> to reach most of them. Away from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>,
        these mostly residential districts contain a maze of back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>,
        muddy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX>, and cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX>. The odd old wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that has
        survived the city‚Äôs numerous fires leans creaking across the
        crumb¬≠¬≠ling bricks of some forgotten <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> ruin. If you choose to
        walk, be prepared to get lost, often, and to be an object of friendly
        curiosity.
        The imposing ¬ªehzade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince</ENAMEX>), which
        overlooks a grassy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> that is unfortunately spoilt by traffic noise,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs early works (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1548</TIMEX>), was built in memory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>ºleyman the
        Magnificent‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet</ENAMEX>, who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1543 aged 21</TIMEX>.
        Spanning the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> of the busy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thoroughfare Atat√ºrk Bulvarƒ±</ENAMEX> are the ruins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aqueduct</ENAMEX> of Valens
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bozdo‚Äòan Kemeri</ENAMEX>), originating back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> a.d. It was
        rebuilt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valens</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>, restored several
        times by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ottomans</ENAMEX>, and remained in use up to as
        recently as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.
        If you follow the line of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX> away from the city
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centre</ENAMEX>, you will soon reach the vast complex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatih Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conqueror</ENAMEX>), perched on top of the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth Hill</ENAMEX>. It was the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">first imperial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> to be built following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conquest of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1453</TIMEX>, and its k√ºlliye (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> complex), the biggest
        in the whole of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX>, included a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, poorhouses, a
        mental asylum, visitors‚Äô accommodation, and a number of schools
        teaching science, mathematics, history, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koranic</ENAMEX> studies. At the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, such enlightened education was unusual anywhere in the world.
        Built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conqueror</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1462 and 1470</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was
        almost completely destroyed by an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1766</TIMEX>. Only the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX> and its huge portal survived; the rest was rebuilt. The tombs
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conqueror</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> are in the walled graveyard behind the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosque</ENAMEX>.
        Farther out, dominating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fifth Hill</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selim</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX> of Selim I), dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>ºleyman the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magnificent</ENAMEX>. Unlike its dedicatee, who was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yavuz Selim</ENAMEX> (Selim
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grim</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> is one of the most charming in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with a
        sparse but tasteful decoration of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iznik</ENAMEX> tiles from the
        earliest period in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX>, blue, and yellow, and richly painted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">woodwork</ENAMEX>. Its dramatic situation overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> commands a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fine</ENAMEX>, sweeping view across the picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fener</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balat</ENAMEX>.
        The brightest jewel in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Istanbul‚Äôs Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown</ENAMEX> is the
        former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Saviour</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chora</ENAMEX>, known in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> as the Kariye
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camii</ENAMEX>. Restored and opened as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX>, this small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>,
        tucked away in a quiet corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, is one of the world‚Äôs
        greatest monuments to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> art. The church‚Äôs name means ‚Äúin the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,‚Äù because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to be built on this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> was outside
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> walls. Although it was later enclosed within the Theodosian
        Walls, the name stuck.
        The oldest part of the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the central domed
        area, dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1120</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was rebuilt and decorated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> under the supervision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theo¬≠dore Metochites</ENAMEX>, an
        art-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX>, states¬≠man, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> who was a close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and advisor
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andronicus II Palaeologus</ENAMEX>. Sadly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metochites</ENAMEX> was reduced
        to poverty and sent into exile when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> was overthrown in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1328</TIMEX>.
        He was allowed to return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1330</TIMEX> provided that he remained
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chora</ENAMEX>, which he did, living out the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of his life
        surrounded by the magnificent works of art he had commissioned.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metochites</ENAMEX> left the central portion of the church intact,
        but he added the outer narthex and the parecclesion (side chapel). The
        wonderful mosaics and frescoes, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1310 and 1320</TIMEX>
        (contemporary with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giotto</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>), are almost certainly the
        work of a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>, now unknown. Their subtlety of colour,
        liveliness of posture, and strong, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifelike</ENAMEX> faces record a last
        remarkable flowering of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> art before its descent into
        decadence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1511</TIMEX>, but
        fortunately it was not substantially altered. The mosaics were covered
        with wooden screens, some windows were boarded up, and a minaret was
        added.
        The mosaics are grouped into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> narrative cycles
        depicting the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> and the Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, along with portraits
        of various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, and large dedicatory panels. The mosaic above the
        door leading from the narthex into the nave shows the figure of
        Metochites, wearing a huge hat, offering a model of his beloved church
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>. Each tiny tile is set at a different angle to its neighbours
        so that the reflected light creates the illusion of a shimmering,
        ethereal image.
        The frescoes are all in the parecclesion, which stretches
        the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and was used in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> times as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">funerary chapel</ENAMEX>. The artist‚Äôs masterpiece is the Anastasis
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resurrection</ENAMEX>) in the vault of the apse, showing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> pulling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX> from their tombs, while the figure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX> lies bound and
        helpless beneath His feet.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fifteen</NUMEX> minutes‚Äô walk from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kariye</ENAMEX>, and marking the
        summit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth Hill</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mihrimah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camii</ENAMEX>, built by Sinan
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1565</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S√ºleyman‚Äôs</ENAMEX> favourite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>. Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodosian Walls</ENAMEX>, pierced here by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Adrianople Gate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edirnekapƒ±</ENAMEX>),
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet the Conqueror</ENAMEX> entered the fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1453</TIMEX>. The double
        walls, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX>, during the reign of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>
        Theodosius, stretch <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">61‚ÅÑ2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Marmara</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX>. They were defended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> and had numerous gates.
        Much of the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> and several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> are still standing.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> gates are still in use.
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Marmara</ENAMEX> end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodosian Walls</ENAMEX>, a long way from
        the city‚Äôs other sights but easily reached by bus or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>, stands the
        ancient fortress of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yedikule</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven Towers</ENAMEX>). It encloses the famous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Gate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altƒ±nkapƒ±</ENAMEX>), the grand triumphal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>
        emperors, which existed before the walls were built and was
        incorporated into them. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1470</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet the Conqueror</ENAMEX> further
        strengthened the ancient portal by building three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> of his own,
        linked by curtain walls to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> flanking the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Gate</ENAMEX>. During <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> times the fortress was used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> and
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hali√ß</ENAMEX>)
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> is an inlet of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>, penetrating
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">71‚ÅÑ2 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">41‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) into the hills behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It forms a natural
        harbour, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> times was the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX> Tershane
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Arsenal</ENAMEX>), capable of holding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is lined with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shipyards</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, and industrial development, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> are
        badly polluted.
        Emin√∂n√º
        The mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> is spanned by the busy Galata
        Bridge. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> here was a wooden structure, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1845</TIMEX>. It
        was replaced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX> by the famous old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pontoon bridge</ENAMEX> with its seafood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, which served until the present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> was opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.
        Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Atat√ºrk Bridge</ENAMEX> farther upstream, its central span opens daily
        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:00 a.m.</TIMEX> to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> in and out.
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Stamboul</ENAMEX> end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> is the colourful district
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emin√∂n√º</ENAMEX>, a major transport <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> where bus, ferry, tram, and train
        services interconnect. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX>, the waterfront becomes a bedlam of
        bodies as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commuters</ENAMEX> pour off the ferries. The air is loud with blasts
        from ships‚Äô horns, and the water boils white as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> vessels
        jostle for a vacant berth. Smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> equipped with cooking fires
        and frying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pans</ENAMEX> bounce around in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wash</ENAMEX>, while their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> dish up
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mackerel sandwiches</ENAMEX> to hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> standing on the quayside,
        seemingly oblivious to the violent, churning movement of their floating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kitchens</ENAMEX>. Adding to the activity are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grilled corn</ENAMEX> cobs,
        lahmacun, simit, and fried mussels, who com¬≠pete with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> boats
        for passing trade while the water-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> tempt thirsty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lemon-</ENAMEX> and cherry-flavoured <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX>.
        The wide square opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> is dominated by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yeni Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mosque</ENAMEX>). Commissioned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1597</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Valide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX>
        Safiye, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet III</ENAMEX>, it was not completed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1663</TIMEX>, making
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yeni Camii</ENAMEX> the youngest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul‚</ENAMEX>Äôs classical mosques.
        The large archway to the right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> is the
        entrance to the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spice Bazaar</ENAMEX>, also known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> Bazaar
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mƒ±sƒ±r √áar¬´ƒ±sƒ±</ENAMEX>). It was opened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yeni Camii</ENAMEX>, and
        its revenues originally paid for repairs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> complex. Inside,
        the air is heady with the mingled aromas of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ginger</ENAMEX>, pepper, cinnamon,
        cloves, and freshly ground <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>. The L-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>,
        many still devoted to the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, herbs and herbal remedies,
        but dried <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and nuts, lokum (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delight</ENAMEX>), fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple tea</ENAMEX>, and more mundane household items occupy most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stalls</ENAMEX>.
        If you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spice Bazaar</ENAMEX> by the gate at the far end of
        the first aisle and then turn right, you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">R√ºstempa¬´a</ENAMEX> Camii
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque of R√ºstem Pa¬´a</ENAMEX>), with its minaret soaring high above the narrow
        back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. This is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs smaller works, and one of his most
        beautiful. The interior is almost completely covered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iznik</ENAMEX> tiles of
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest</TIMEX> period, with floral and geometric designs in blue,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">turquoise</ENAMEX>, and coral red.
        Ey√ºp
        Ferries depart from the upstream side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galata Bridge</ENAMEX>
        for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the half-hour</TIMEX> trip along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> to the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ey√ºp</ENAMEX>,
        which contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islam‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ey√ºp Sultan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>) marks the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial place</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ey√ºp Ensari</ENAMEX>, the
        standard-bearer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prophet Mohammed</ENAMEX>. He died in battle while
        carrying the banner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> siege of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between a.d. 674 and 678</TIMEX>. Following the conquest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1453</TIMEX>, his grave was
        rediscovered, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet the Conqueror</ENAMEX> erected a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> on the spot,
        followed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1458</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX>.
        Thereafter each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX>, on his accession, visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ey√ºp Camii</ENAMEX> to gird
        himself ceremonially with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sword of Osman</ENAMEX>, the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX>.
        The original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> was destroyed by an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1766</TIMEX>; the present
        building dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tomb of Ey√ºp Ensari</ENAMEX>, opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, is decorated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, and coloured tiles, and is protected by a gilded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grille</ENAMEX>. Remember that this is a sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">place‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdress respectfully</ENAMEX> (long
        trousers or long skirt and long-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sleeved</NUMEX> shirt; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> should cover their
        heads, shoulders, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>), remove your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> before entering, and do
        not use your camera.
        Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, on the hill, is a vast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> littered
        with turbanned headstones. A path winds up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Loti Caf√©</ENAMEX>,
        named in honour of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> who once lived in the
        neighbourhood, and who wrote a number of romantic novels about life in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>. The caf√© enjoys a splendid view down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> to the
        distant and distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> and minarets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stamboul</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New City‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇBeyoGlu
        The north shore of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gold¬≠en Horn</ENAMEX> was traditionally the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>, foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> made their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homes</ENAMEX>, beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genoese</ENAMEX> founded a trading
        colony in the district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galata</ENAMEX>. Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conquest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambassadors</ENAMEX> built their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> on the hills beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Galata</ENAMEX>, a place
        which came to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúbeyond‚Äù</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Foreigners</ENAMEX> from the
        entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> flooded into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galata</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pera</ENAMEX>, attracted by the
        wealth and sophistication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. As the area became
        increasingly crowded, the wealthy foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> moved
        farther out along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚ÄúGrande Rue de Pera‚Äù</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istiklal Caddesi</ENAMEX>),
        forming a focus for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th- and 20th-century</TIMEX> expansion of the modern,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX>-style part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BeyogÀòlu</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galata</ENAMEX> and Pera
        As you cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Bridge</ENAMEX>, crowded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>,
        office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, water-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>, and anglers, your eyes are drawn
        naturally to the pointed turret of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Tower</ENAMEX>. Some-time during
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> a rough bunch of coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> and drifters from
        every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> began to settle on the northern shore
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Horn</ENAMEX>, in the maritime quarter which became known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galata</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Tower</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galata Kulesi</ENAMEX>) was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keystone</ENAMEX> in the
        colony‚Äôs defences. Its age is uncertain, but it seems to have been
        built in its present form around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1349</TIMEX>, at the highest point of the city
        walls. Now restored, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclub</ENAMEX> at the top, it
        offers a superb panoramic view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> (open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00 a.m.</TIMEX>
        ‚<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Äì6:00 p.m.</TIMEX> ). If you look across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX>, you can count the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minarets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> which embellish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous skyline. From left
        to right they are: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Mosque</ENAMEX>; the Nuruosmaniye
        (above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Bridge</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beyazƒ±t Camii</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beyazƒ±t Tower</ENAMEX>; the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√ºleymaniye</ENAMEX>, looming over the far shore; the ¬ªehzade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camii</ENAMEX> (in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX>); the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aqueduct of Valens</ENAMEX>; the twin minarets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Fatih</ENAMEX> Camii
        (above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Atat√ºrk Bridge</ENAMEX>); and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selim Camii</ENAMEX>.
        To avoid the steep climb up the hill beyond the Galata
        Bridge take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√ºnel</ENAMEX>, the world‚Äôs oldest (and probably shortest)
        underground railway, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1875</TIMEX>. The trip to the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> takes
        just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 seconds</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX>). To reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galata Tower</ENAMEX> from the top
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX>, turn left out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX> and immediately left down a very
        steep road. Follow your nose for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about five minutes</TIMEX> until you see a
        sign saying ‚ÄúKuledibi‚Äù on the left, which points the way to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>.
        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√</ENAMEX>ºnel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX>, restored 1920s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> clang their

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">embassies</ENAMEX> of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> have been downgraded to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consulates</ENAMEX> since the capital was transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ankara</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923</TIMEX>, and
        modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> have sprung up. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is now a
        pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">precinct</ENAMEX>, and boasts some of the city‚Äôs most stylish caf√©s.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Galatasaray Square</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istiklal Caddesi</ENAMEX> bends to the right, an
        elegant wrought-iron gateway marks the entrance to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galatasaray Lisesi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lyc√©e</ENAMEX> (secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>) that

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clubs</ENAMEX>. )

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>. It is liveliest in the evenings, when the tables fill with
        a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. The opposite end of the passage leads
        into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balƒ±k Pazarƒ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fish Market</ENAMEX>), a block of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> lined

        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taksim Meydanƒ±</ENAMEX>), the heart of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Istanbul</ENAMEX>, lined with luxurious

        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Atat√ºrk K√ºl¬≠¬≠t√ºr Saray√®</ENAMEX>), also called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Opera House</ENAMEX>. It is the main
        venue for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">International Istanbul Festival</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>).
        At the far end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cumhuriyet Caddesi</ENAMEX> leads past
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotel</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Askeri M√ºze</ENAMEX>). The fascinating

        used to stretch across the mouth of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Horn</ENAMEX> to keep out enemy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ships</ENAMEX>, as well as captured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy cannon</ENAMEX> and military banners, the
        campaign <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sultans</ENAMEX> controlled their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX>,
        and examples of uniforms, armour, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> from the earliest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> down to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>. The main attraction is the concert

        through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> is a revival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> that
        accompanied the sultans‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> on their campaigns and led the victory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">processions</ENAMEX> through the conquered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. The colourful uniforms are
        exact replicas of the originals, as is the distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Janissary</ENAMEX> march,
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">musicians</ENAMEX> turning to left and right at each alternate
        step.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolmabah√ße Palace</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan Abd√ºl Mecit</ENAMEX> (reigned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1839‚Äì1861</NUMEX>), continuing the
        programme of reform begun by his father <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmut II</ENAMEX>, decided that Topkapƒ±
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> was too old-fashioned for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Westernizing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> such as himself.
        He therefore commissioned a vast new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> on the shores of the
        Bosphorus, on the site of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> that had been created by filling in an
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">harbour‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">dolmabah√ße means ‚Äúfilled-in garden‚Äù</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dolma</ENAMEX>-bah√ße

        finished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1853</TIMEX>, was intended as a bold statement of the sultan‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">faith</ENAMEX> in the future of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>, but instead it turned out to be a
        monument to folly and extravagance. Its construction nearly emptied the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial treasury</ENAMEX>, and the running costs came to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¬£2 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, a
        burden that led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Empire‚Äôs</ENAMEX> bankruptcy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1875</TIMEX>.
        The guided tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parts‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇfirst the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selamlƒ±k</ENAMEX> (public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Throne Room</ENAMEX>, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harem</ENAMEX> (private
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apartments</ENAMEX>). The interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is very dark, and the use of
        flash is forbidden, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> should think twice before paying
        the extra fee for bringing in a camera or video equipment.
        The highlights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selamlƒ±k</ENAMEX> include the vast Baccarat
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bohemian</ENAMEX> crystal chandeliers, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> in all, and the crystal balustrade
        of the main staircase, the sultan‚Äôs marble and alabaster <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>, two
        huge bearskins (a gift from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsar</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>®vres vases, Gobelin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tapestries</ENAMEX> and carpets, and the vast bed used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">‚Äúgiant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX>,‚Äù

        Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.2 miles</NUMEX>) beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dolmabah√</ENAMEX>ße you can escape
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> among the wooded walks of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yƒ±ldƒ±z Park</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> up the hill
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malta K√∂sk√º</ENAMEX>, a restored royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> that has been converted
        into a caf√©, and enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and pastries on a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> looking
        over the treetops to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX>.
        Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">¬ªale K√∂sk√º</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chalet Pavilion</ENAMEX>), set among
        beautiful gardens. It was built by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Abd√ºl Hamid II</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> for the
        sultan‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> on state visits, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abd√ºl Hamid</ENAMEX> liked it so much that
        he lived there himself until he was deposed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1909</TIMEX>. Its main claim to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fame</ENAMEX> is that it contains the world‚Äôs largest hand-made carpet (guided
        tours only, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 a.m. ‚Äì5:00 p.m.</TIMEX> , closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>).
        Along the Bosphorus
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul BogÀòazƒ±</ENAMEX>) is the narrow strait
        linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Black Sea</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sea of Marmara</ENAMEX>, and separating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> from the vast hinterland of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anatolia</ENAMEX>. The
        winding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">18 miles</NUMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>)
        wide, narrowing to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">750 metres</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,250 feet</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumeli Hisarƒ±</ENAMEX>.
        The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> is derived from the mythological
        character <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Io</ENAMEX>, who swam across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX> after being turned into a
        heifer by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> means ‚Äúford of the ox‚Äù in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jason</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argonauts</ENAMEX> traveled through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX> in their search for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Fleece</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darius</ENAMEX> crossed on a bridge

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX> is busy with commercial shipping,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ferries</ENAMEX>, and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, and its wooded shores are lined with pretty
        fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>, and the villas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        wealthier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>. It is spanned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> impressive suspension <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bridge ever to link <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus Bridge</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bo‚Äòa‚Äòzi√ßi K√∂pr√ºs√º</ENAMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ortak√∂y</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>, and at that time the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> longest in the world (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,074 metres/3,524 feet</NUMEX>). It was followed
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumeli Hisarƒ±</ENAMEX>.
        Special ferry tours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> depart <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a
        day from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emin√∂n√º</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX>), calling at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Be¬´ikta¬´</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanlƒ±ca, Yenik√∂y, Sarƒ±yer</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anadolu Kava‚Äòƒ±.</ENAMEX> You can remain

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosphorus</ENAMEX> Tour
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> leaves the crowded quay at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emin√∂n√º</ENAMEX> and heads
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX>, past the dazzling white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wedding-cake fa√</ENAMEX>ßades of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolmabah√</ENAMEX>ße
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> and the neighbouring √áiragÀòan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX>, gutted by fire in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1910</TIMEX> but
        no w restored as a luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. After stopping at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Be¬´ikta¬´</ENAMEX>, you pass
        beneath the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the huge suspension <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> connecting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
        Tucked beneath the western end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bosphorus Bridge</ENAMEX> is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ortak√∂y</ENAMEX>, recognizable by its distinctively Baroque
        mosque right on the waterfront. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> has a rather Bohemian
        atmosphere, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, bookstalls, and caf√©s. Beyond
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, on the opposite shore, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beylerbeyi Palace</ENAMEX>, a summer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residence</ENAMEX> and hunting lodge built for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd√ºl Aziz</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1865</TIMEX> (guided

        If you head north past the rich suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arnavutk√∂y</ENAMEX> and
        Bebek, you will soon reach the massive fortress of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumeli Hisarƒ±</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</TIMEX> , closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>). It was built at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mehmet II</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1452</TIMEX> in preparation for his last assault on
        Constantinople, and was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only four months</TIMEX>. Its walls
        enclose a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> with an open-air theatre that stages
        folk-dancing and concerts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
        On the opposite shore is the smaller and older fortress of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anadolu Hisarƒ±</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1390</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of the fort</ENAMEX> is the ornate

        favourite picnic spot known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Sweet Waters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
        Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> stops at
        Kanlƒ±ca on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> shore, famous for its yoghurt, which you can
        sample at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the little waterside caf√©s. The upper reaches of the
        Bosphorus are lined with picturesque fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">villages‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇTarabya</ENAMEX>,
        Sarƒ±yer, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rumeli Kava‚Äòƒ±‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇwhere you can enjoy a meal at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the

        √úsk√ºdar
        Directly opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stamboul</ENAMEX> lies √úsk√ºdar, better known as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scutari</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>. The ferry from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emin√∂n√º</ENAMEX> passes the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kƒ±z</ENAMEX> Kulesi

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scutari</ENAMEX> is traditionally associated with the name of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Justin II</ENAMEX> built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> on the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>; it soon came to be known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prinkipo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince‚Äôs Isle</ENAMEX>, and
        the name later spread to cover the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the islands‚Äô pretty beaches provide the perfect
        weekend retreat location for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Cars</ENAMEX> are banned,
        and all transport is by foot, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX>, or horse-drawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriage</ENAMEX>.
        The biggest and most popular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B√ºy√ºkada</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>), with a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and a picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>. You can take

        Bursa
        The historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bursa</ENAMEX> lies scattered across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wooded slopes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uluda‚Äò</ENAMEX>, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Mountain</ENAMEX>, to the south of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea of Marmara</ENAMEX>. It was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>
        Prusias of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bithynia</ENAMEX>, and named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prusa</ENAMEX> in his honour. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1326</TIMEX> it was
        taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orhan Gazi</ENAMEX>, and became the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. Although the capital was moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edirne</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1362</TIMEX>, and then to
        Istanbul, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bursa</ENAMEX> remained an important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, with a rich legacy of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">religious architecture‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe foun¬≠der</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> dynasty and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> are buried here. Other attractions include hot
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">springs</ENAMEX>, a market, and the forests and ski-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slopes</ENAMEX> of nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Uluda‚Äò</ENAMEX>.
        Bursa‚Äôs most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ye¬´il T√ºrbe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb</ENAMEX>), which takes its name from the beautiful tiles that cover its
        walls. It houses the sarcophagus of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mehmet I</ENAMEX> (ruled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1413‚Äì21</NUMEX>), itself
        ornately decorated with patterned Iznik tiles. Below the tomb is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ye¬´il Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Mosque</ENAMEX>), commissioned by <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mehmet I</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1419</TIMEX>. It is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unfinished</ENAMEX>, as work on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> traditionally stopped after the death
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> who began it. Despite this the interior is still
        breathtakingly beautiful, decorated with the best tiles.
        The town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Art</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T√</ENAMEX>ºrk ve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam Eserleri M√ºzesi</ENAMEX>) is just next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. This mu¬≠seum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">displays Karag√∂z</ENAMEX> shadow puppets, made from coloured, translucent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camelskin</ENAMEX>. Although this type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shadow</ENAMEX> play probably originated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, the stories which made it popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> were based on the
        exploits of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bursa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peasants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karag√∂z</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hacivat</ENAMEX> were fellow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">labourers</ENAMEX> whose practical jokes incurred the wrath of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orhan</ENAMEX>.
        They were put to death on his orders, but their earthy humour lives on
        in the puppet plays that became popular throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, and
        especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bursa</ENAMEX>.
        The pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city centre</ENAMEX> is bounded at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX>
        end by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ulu Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Mosque</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX> quarried from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uluda‚Äò.</ENAMEX> It has a rectangular prayer hall capped by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>, supported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> great pillars‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcompare this to the imperial
        mosques of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX>, which reflect the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haghia Sophia</ENAMEX>. An
        archway <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leads</ENAMEX> from the centre of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koza Hanƒ±</ENAMEX>, an
        arcaded caravanserai (an inn) built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> and which today
        is the centre of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bursa‚</ENAMEX>Äôs silk trade. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> you can watch dealers
        haggling over heaps of white silkworm cocoons. Beyond the caravanserai
        is the town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covered Market</ENAMEX>, which is as interesting to explore as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul‚Äôs.</ENAMEX>
        You can enjoy a fine view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX> that holds the tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orhan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osman Gazi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osman Gazi</ENAMEX> was the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Osman</ENAMEX>, the dynasty that ruled the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600 years</TIMEX>. He died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1324</TIMEX> in the neighbouring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√∂‚Äò√ºt</ENAMEX>, but was buried in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bursa</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1326</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> had been captured
        by his son, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orhan Gazi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osman‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb was formerly a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>
        baptistery, and his son‚Äôs tomb is in the nave of the neighbouring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">church‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfragments</ENAMEX> of its ancient mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX> can be seen on the
        floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>.
        More imperial tombs can be seen at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Muradiye</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>,
        which comprises a fragrant rose garden with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> and several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">t√ºrbes</ENAMEX>, including that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murat II</ENAMEX> (ruled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1421‚Äì1451</NUMEX>). His
        earth-filled sarcophagus lies beneath an opening in the crown of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dome</ENAMEX>, so that his grave can be washed clean when it rains.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean Coast</ENAMEX>
        Turkey‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean coast</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> destinations, offering an unparalleled combination of natural
        beauty and historical interest. This was one of the most densely

        Set amid this wealth of historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are many beautiful

        international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
        Gallipoli
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gallipoli Peninsula</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gelibolu Yarƒ±madasƒ±</ENAMEX>), on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">north</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dardanelles</ENAMEX>, was the scene of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most
        notorious military campaigns of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. The Allied</ENAMEX> assault,
        involving <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Australian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, aimed to
        capture the peninsula and control the narrow strait of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dardanelles</ENAMEX>,
        thus securing an ice-free sea passage to supply <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and open
        a front against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> landings took place on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 April 1915</TIMEX>, and met
        with fierce resistance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mustafa Kemal</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Allies</ENAMEX> only managed to gain a toehold on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">peninsula</ENAMEX>, and then deadlock ensued, with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly nine months</TIMEX> of static
        trench warfare. The cost in human lives was terrible, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> dead
        and wounded on each side. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anzacs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Zealand Army</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX>) saw some of the worst fighting and suffered the heaviest
        casualties; the beach where they landed has been named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anzac Cove</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anzak K√∂y√º</ENAMEX>) in their honour.
        The whole peninsula is a memorial, with plaques describing
        the campaign‚Äôs progress, and monuments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX>. Each war <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX> is signposted, and all are
        beautifully tended, planted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and scented with fragrant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hedges</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rosemary</ENAMEX>. Travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">√áanakkale</TIMEX>, across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">strait</ENAMEX>,
        provide guided tours of the peninsula. A memorial service is held each

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Troy</ENAMEX>
        The exact location of the legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> remained
        a mystery until an amateur archaeologist with a passion for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX> began
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excavations</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinrich Schliemann</ENAMEX> found his fabled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">discovered ‚ÄúPriam‚Äôs treasure,‚</ENAMEX>Äù a cache of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> beside the city walls.
        He smuggled it back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, but it vanished during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>,
        only to make a dramatic reappearance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.
        Archaeologists have now uncovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> superimposed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> I, an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early Bronze Age settlement</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3000‚Äì2500 b.c.</ENAMEX> )
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenistic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> metropolis, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilium Novum</ENAMEX>, which

        destruction around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1260 b.c.</TIMEX> ; certain eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> archaeologists
        disagree, instead opting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding</TIMEX> level, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Troy VI</ENAMEX>.
        The site, near the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hƒ±sarlƒ±k</ENAMEX>, is marked by a
        large modern replica of the famed wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>. The excavations are
        actually less impressive than those at most other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, but
        for those who have enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Homer‚Äôs Iliad and Odyssey</ENAMEX> it is a magical
        place, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> are haunted by the spirits of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Helen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achilles</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agamemnon</ENAMEX>.
        Pergamum
        At the height of its power, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> b.c. ,
        Pergamum was one of the most splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> coast. Its
        acropolis was capped with magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and it boasted a great
        library of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 200,000</NUMEX> volumes (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pergamenes</ENAMEX> are credited with the
        invention of parchment). Its ruins, perched high above the modern town
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergama</ENAMEX>, are still impressive.
        The acropolis was built on a set of terraces. On the left
        of the entrance ramp is the open space once occupied by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>, close to which are the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pergamene</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. Its
        contents were eventually given to the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX> as a gift
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Antony</ENAMEX>, and went to enrich the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>.
        Beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> is the city‚Äôs most splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>,
        its glittering white marble columns, now partly restored. The Trajaneum
        was erected during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> a.d. in honour of the deified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emperors Trajan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadrian</ENAMEX>.
        Below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> is the steep cavea of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theatre</ENAMEX>, set in a shallow <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> in the hillside. Nearby is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">base of the Altar of Zeus</ENAMEX>, built to commemorate the defeat of the Gauls
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX> b.c. This was once decorated with a remarkable
        frieze depicting the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Battle of the Gods</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>, one of the finest
        existing examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenistic</ENAMEX> sculpture, which now resides in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlin‚Äôs Pergamon Museum</ENAMEX>.
        Visible on the plain below is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asclepion</ENAMEX>, one of the
        ancient world‚Äôs leading medical centres, rivalling similar
        establishments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidauros, Kos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ephesus</ENAMEX>. Dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asclepius</ENAMEX>,
        god of healing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asclepion</ENAMEX> provided hot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, massages, dream
        interpretation, primitive psychiatry, and draughts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from a
        sacred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> (found to be mildly radioactive). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 130‚Äì200</ENAMEX>),

        The entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asclepion</ENAMEX> is located along a
        colonnaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sacred Way</ENAMEX>, which leads to the medical precinct.
        Here you can see the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, theatre, and treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. In the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is a pool fed by the sacred

        Sardis
        The site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sardis</ENAMEX>, the former capital of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lydia</ENAMEX>,
        is situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izmir</ENAMEX>, on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U¬´ak</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afyon</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lydians</ENAMEX> invented <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coinage</ENAMEX>, producing the first-ever coins of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, stamped with the royal emblem: a lion‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. The gold
        was washed down from the hills by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Pactolus</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">historian Herodotus</ENAMEX> relates how flakes of the precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> were
        trapped in the fleece of sheepskins spread in the stream-bed, perhaps
        giving rise to the legend of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Fleece</ENAMEX>.
        Sardis was once the wealthiest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the world, under
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Croesus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">reigned 560‚Äì546 b.c.</ENAMEX> ), hence the expression

        attacked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> he would destroy a great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. He attacked
        anyway, and was crushed‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> he destroyed was his own. The
        monuments you see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today date</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> times.
        The principal ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sardis</ENAMEX> are in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts. On the
        left side of the main highway you will find the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gymnasium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. From
        the car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> you follow a line of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> to a gate at the far
        end, which leads into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">synagogue</ENAMEX>, whose floor is richly decorated
        with mosaic patterns. The gymnasium itself, a huge open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, is
        dominated by the magnificently restored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marble Court</ENAMEX>, lined with ornate
        marble columns and niches which once held statues. The arched gateway
        leads to a large swimming pool and the ruins of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths complex</ENAMEX>.
        In the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, a side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leads south for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 km</TIMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1‚ÅÑ2 mile</NUMEX>) to the imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Artemis</ENAMEX>, begun during the reign of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX>, and abandoned, unfinished, following the
        ascendancy of Christianity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>. The enormous
        structure had a peristyle of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> columns, of which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> still stand at
        their full height. A small <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> hides behind
        the columns at the far end.
        Izmir
        Known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smyrna</ENAMEX>, and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> as ‚ÄúG√ºzel

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the finest natural harbour on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> coast. The city
        was founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third millennium</TIMEX> b.c. on the north shore of the bay,
        and reached a peak during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tenth century b.c.</ENAMEX> , when it was one of
        the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ionian Federation‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe poet Homer</ENAMEX> was
        born in S myrna during this period. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lydian</ENAMEX> conquest of the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth century</TIMEX> b.c. the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> lost its importance, but was refounded by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX> on the slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Pagus</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kadifekale</ENAMEX>), and
        under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> it became one of the principal centres of
        Mediterranean trade.
        When the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> took control in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>,
        Izmir grew wealthy as a merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, handling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smyrna</ENAMEX> figs and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        tobacco from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> of the interior, and allowing the establishment
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>. It prospered as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Levantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> until
        the close of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Greco-Turkish War</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>, when it was almost
        completely destroyed by fire. Rebuilt around the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, it is once again a bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, but almost
        no trace remains of its former glory.
        The heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konak Meydanƒ±</ENAMEX>, a busy pedestrian
        square distinguished by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> famous monuments. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saat Kulesi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clock</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower</ENAMEX>), dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1901</TIMEX>, is the unofficial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izmir</ENAMEX>. Nearby
        stands the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Konak Camii</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1756</TIMEX> and decorated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colourful K√</ENAMEX>ºtahya tile panels. On the hill to the south of the square
        stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>, whose superb collection of
        antiquities includes statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poseidon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demeter</ENAMEX> that once stood in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX> of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smyrna</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethnographic Museum</ENAMEX>, opposite,
        recreates the interiors of traditional local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Inland from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Konak Mosque</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izmir‚</ENAMEX>Äôs bazaar, one of the best in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Konak Meydanƒ±, Atat√ºrk Caddesi</ENAMEX> (also known as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kordon</ENAMEX>) runs along the waterfront to the ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alsancak</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) away. A horse-drawn phaeton will take you on a tour, which
        passes through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cumhuriyet Meydanƒ±</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic Square</ENAMEX>), the centre of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modern Izmir</ENAMEX>, surrounded by glittering luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and palm-fringed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">promenades</ENAMEX>. Nearby is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">K√ºlt√ºr Parkƒ±</ENAMEX>, a huge, shady pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>,
        venue of the annual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Fair</ENAMEX>. Uphill to the south of the park
        lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agora</ENAMEX>, one of the few remaining traces of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izmir‚</ENAMEX>Äôs ancient
        history. This colonnaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, built during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> a.d. ,
        was once the city‚Äôs bustling marketplace. At the top of the hill is the
        imposing medieval fortress of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kadifekale</ENAMEX>. This was the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount</ENAMEX>
        Pagus, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX> commanded his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lysimachus</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antigonus</ENAMEX> to found a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c. However,
        no trace remains of their original fortifications.
        √áe¬´me
        A six-lane toll motorway leads <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 miles</NUMEX>) west of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izmir</ENAMEX> to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> and ferry port of √áe¬´me, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> cross

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> was a quiet <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> and beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> (its name means ‚Äúdrinking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fountain‚Äù</ENAMEX>) until the motorway‚Äôs arrival brought it within comfortable
        commuting distance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>; now it is set to become a bustling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">seaside</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Izmir</ENAMEX>, and a terminal for international ferries from

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is dominated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genoese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> built in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th century</TIMEX>, and enlarged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX>. Beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> lies an

        easy to transport yourself to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times.
        Ionian <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> from the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samos</ENAMEX> settled in Ephesus
        around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> b.c. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> was associated with the worship of the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemis</ENAMEX>. The great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Artemis</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven Wonders</ENAMEX> of the
        World, was erected in her honour. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was ruled in turn by the
        Lydians, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attalid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pergamum</ENAMEX>, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">133</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c.</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attalus III</ENAMEX> bequeathed his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ephesus</ENAMEX> with it, to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>. Ephesus was one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200,000</NUMEX>, and grew wealthy on the
        proceeds of trade. But its greatness was linked to its fine natural
        harbour, and when this silted up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> a.d. the city
        went into decline. The site was rediscovered by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> archaeologist
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> of searching. Many of the ruins that you see
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today date</TIMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> period, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the first century</TIMEX> b.c. and
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> a.d.
        Most of the guided tours commence at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Magnesian Gate</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> downhill along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> inside the
        gate are the well-preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Odeum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>). Its semi-circular
        seats, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prytaneum</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">archaeologists</ENAMEX> found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> statues of
        Artemis, now on display in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sel√ßuk Museum</ENAMEX>. The marble-paved Street
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curetes</ENAMEX>, stone rutted by ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart wheels</ENAMEX>, leads through the
        Gate of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX> to the remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Hadrian</ENAMEX>, with an arched

        also included a brothel.
        Rising up ahead is the imposing fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Library</ENAMEX> of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bible</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Acts 19</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">24‚Äì41</ENAMEX>). Its vast cavea provided seating for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and still accommodates the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> who gather for performances
        during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ephesus International Festival</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>). From
        the top rows of seats you can enjoy a grand view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arcadian Way</ENAMEX>,
        the city‚Äôs col¬≠onnaded main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, once lined with fine statues, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lit</ENAMEX> by oil lamps at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. At its far end a scrub-filled depression
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX> the site of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbour</ENAMEX>, long since silted up.
        The small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sel√ßuk</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) from
        Ephesus, has an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> and several noteworthy monuments.
        The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basilica</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ayasuluk Hill</ENAMEX>, marks the
        site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apostle‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>. The fortress above dates from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>
        times. Downhill you will find the impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isa Bey Mosque</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1375</TIMEX>), and
        beyond is a solitary column marking the site of the once-great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemis</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John the Apostle</ENAMEX> brought the Virgin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ephesus</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">a.d. 37‚Äì‚ÄÇ48</ENAMEX>. Situated at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meryemana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Mary</ENAMEX>)
        in the hills above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where she is thought to have
        passed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last years</TIMEX> of her life. It was discovered during the 19th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Izmir</ENAMEX> following instructions given by a German
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nun</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Katharina Emmerich</ENAMEX>, who had seen it in a vision. There is now
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX> occupying the site, which has long been a place of pilgrimage,
        but the building‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> may date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South</ENAMEX> from Ephesus
        Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sel√ßuk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodrum</ENAMEX> lie <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> important
        archaeological sites that can all be easily seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>.
        Priene, once one of the most active <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> in the Ionian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation</ENAMEX>, now stands <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) inland, due to the silting
        up of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Maeander</ENAMEX>. It enjoys a beautiful location on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>
        overlooking the plain, backed by the steep crag of the acropolis. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theatre</ENAMEX>, bouleterion (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>), and agora are worth exploring,
        but the main attraction is the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>, who passed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">334 b.c.</TIMEX> , paid for its
        completion; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> columns have been restored to their
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> height.
        The silt of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Maeander</ENAMEX> has also stranded the
        once-mighty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miletus</ENAMEX>. Its harbour, from which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> set
        forth to found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries b.c.</ENAMEX> , is now a frog-filled marsh. Some inkling of its former
        glory can be gleaned from the ruins of the agora, the theatre, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baths of Faustina</ENAMEX>.
        The most impressive of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Didyma</ENAMEX>. No city
        ever stood here, just the colossal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>, one of the largest
        and most elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> in the ancient world. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> columns still
        stand, but the forest of massive marble stumps gives some idea of the
        grandeur of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> would travel great distances
        to consult the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oracle of Apollo</ENAMEX>, seeking advice on business issues,
        marriage, and military campaigns. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Persians</ENAMEX> destroyed Miletus
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">494</NUMEX> b.c. they also razed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Didyma</ENAMEX>. Its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> was begun by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX> (his decisive victory
        over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaugamela</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">331 b.c.</TIMEX> was predicted by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oracle</ENAMEX>), and continued for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many centuries</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was never
        completed; note that some of the columns remain unfluted.
        Bodrum
        The picture-postcard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodrum</ENAMEX> occupies the site of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ancient Halicarnassus</ENAMEX>, famed as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mausolus</ENAMEX> (whose tomb
        was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Seven Wonders of the World</ENAMEX>), as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Herodotus, the ‚ÄúFather of History</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Little</ENAMEX> remains of
        Halicarnassus, however, and the town‚Äôs main attractions include its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">laid-back</ENAMEX>, bohemian atmosphere, a beautiful double bay backed by
        whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, and the magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusader Castle</ENAMEX> that dominates
        the harbour. No wonder it has been dubbed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Tropez</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>.
        The attractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodrum</ENAMEX>, however, have not gone unnoticed‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇduring
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer months</TIMEX> it is very crowded and very noisy, and more
        international in flavour than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knights of St. John</ENAMEX>, who used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> that had been quarried from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ruins of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus</ENAMEX>. It fell to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottomans</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1523</TIMEX>, and its various <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> now house a fine collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antiquities</ENAMEX>, including a fascinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Underwater Archaeology</ENAMEX>.
        The various towers offer splendid views across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and harbour. In
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> Tower the banqueting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> has been restored, and you can
        sip a glass of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> while you entertain yourself and read the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centuries-old graffiti</ENAMEX> carved in the window niches by homesick knights
        who stayed here.
        The site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mausoleum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mausolus</ENAMEX>, is
        set a few blocks in from the harbour. It was begun around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">355 b.c.</TIMEX> at
        the behest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> (the word ‚Äúmausoleum‚Äù is derived from his name)
        and remained standing until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the 12th century</TIMEX>. By the time the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crusaders</ENAMEX> arrived in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1402</TIMEX> it was in ruins, destroyed by an earthquake.
        Today, nothing remains except the foundations. An exhibition hall
        displays several versions as to how the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> may have previously
        looked, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster</ENAMEX>-casts of the friezes that once decorated its walls;
        the originals are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>.
        There are no good beaches in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodrum</ENAMEX> itself, which could be
        an advantage, as you have more choice if you take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> trip from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harbour</ENAMEX> to one of the many coves that lie hidden along the coast of the
        peninsula to the west, or catch a dolmu¬´ to a selection of pretty
        fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>: namely <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turgutreis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G√ºm√º¬´l√ºk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yalƒ±k¬≠avak</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T√ºrkb√ºk√º</ENAMEX>.
        Pamukkale
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most popular excursions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aegean</ENAMEX> resorts
        goes to the spectacular travertine terraces of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pamukkale</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX>), which lie above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denizli</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 200 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125 miles</NUMEX>)
        inland from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ku¬´adasƒ±.</ENAMEX>
        This remarkable natural formation has been created by
        mineral-rich hot springs cascading down the hillside and depositing
        layers of calcium carbonate. The resulting pools, terraces, and
        ‚Äúpetrified waterfalls‚Äù of dazzling white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travertine</ENAMEX> are one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turkey‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        most famous sights.
        The ruins of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hierapolis</ENAMEX> lie scattered on the
        hillside above the terraces, adding historical interest to natural
        beauty. In the grounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pamukkale Motel</ENAMEX> you can bathe in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacred Pool</ENAMEX>, where the therapeutic, restorative spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> will
        float you above a picturesque jumble of broken columns and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinthian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capitals</ENAMEX>.
        A trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamukkale</ENAMEX> usually includes a visit to the site
        of the ancient city of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aphrodisias</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, dedicated to the worship
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aphrodite</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> of love, was famous for its superb sculpture. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ruins</ENAMEX>, which are still being excavated, include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
        best-preserved stadia in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">228</NUMEX> metres (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">748 feet</NUMEX>) long, with
        seating for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX>, and the remarkable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sebasteion</ENAMEX>, a porticoed gallery
        of sculpture dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aphrodite</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>.
