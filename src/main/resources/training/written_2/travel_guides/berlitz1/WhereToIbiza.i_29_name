        ‚Ä¢ From architecture to zoology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibiza‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇlaid</ENAMEX> back, yet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lively‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇoffers things seen nowhere else on earth. Whether your

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Island</ENAMEX>, as this destination is often called because of its white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢Each area of the island offers something different. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalt Vila</ENAMEX> districts of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> have lots of trendy

        while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX> is notorious for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also

        beyond the bustling tourist zone.
        ‚Ä¢If you crave a change of environment, a day‚Äôs outing to
        Formentera offers the bonus of a sea voyage. Life is simpler on this
        secluded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and the beaches are not so crowded. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> probably be

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Ä¢Ibiza Town</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢The</ENAMEX> island‚Äôs capital and main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eivissa</ENAMEX>), is neatly divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas. There is the old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">town‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Dalt Vila‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Marina</ENAMEX>, the harbour. Most visitors
        guiding themselves through a sightseeing day in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> arrive by
        bus from one of the outlying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> stop either at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station on Isidoro Macabich</ENAMEX>, or‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin the case of the small blue

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Isidoro Macabich</ENAMEX> intersects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avinguda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ignacio Wallis</ENAMEX>; turn

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">passeig Vara del Rey</ENAMEX>, a favourite spot to while time away in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Ä¢As you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> see, this modest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> is where the local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> get together to decide how to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side
        a news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> offers a wide selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>, while in
        the middle of this pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">promenade stands</ENAMEX> an old-fashioned, rousing
        monument to one of the island‚Äôs few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native sons</ENAMEX> who was successful in
        making a mark on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> history. The local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Joaqu√≠n</ENAMEX> Vara
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Rey</ENAMEX>, was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> who died defending the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX>
        against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the war of 1898</TIMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> are several outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>©s where
        a caf√© <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">con leche</ENAMEX> can be stretched over a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">whole morning</TIMEX> of basking in
        the sun, postcard writing, map reading, or watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. The
        caf√©s situated nearest to the port attract the chic and sophisticated,
        among others, who sit at tables covered with yellow tablecloths and are
        served by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX> who, with exaggerated formality by local standards,
        are smartly decked out in bow ties and white jackets. Here, also, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tycoons</ENAMEX> transact business in the civilized <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> way: over
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brandy</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢After a coffee break and an eyeful of the passing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>,
        it‚Äôs time to begin an unpackaged tour of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. The most logical
        place to start is down at the harbour. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is virtually round the
        corner from the passeig.
        ‚Ä¢An imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> in the centre of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> area serves the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liners from Palma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, and other scheduled ferry
        points. The passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> is a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with a restaurant
        on top. At any time at least one of the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> is loading or
        unloading <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, cargo, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, so there‚Äôs always plenty of
        maritime action for you to savour at leisure.
        ‚Ä¢In front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and now serving as a traffic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">roundabout</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corsair Obelisk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Obelisco</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">los Corsarios)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇbelieved
        to be the world‚Äôs only monument in praise of privateers (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Ä¢Inland</ENAMEX> from here is the heart of the district called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marina</ENAMEX>, which genuinely looks the part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> port. If you
        look beyond the souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> for the moment, there are traditional
        sights to remember here: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in black who blend into the shadows,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> coming home from the sea, and everywhere the typical white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses bedecked</ENAMEX> with flower pots on wrought-iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> forget to explore <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the hilly</NUMEX>, narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the
        arm of land called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa Penya</ENAMEX> occupied by many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ibizan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Be warned, though‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drip</ENAMEX>-drying from upper floors
        may splash you; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> may get in your way; and the
        aromas of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baking bread</ENAMEX> may distract you. If
        the senses, to say nothing of the feet, need a break, relax on the
        waterfront with its abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">open-air caf√©s</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> this district
        is a popular entertainment area. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from
        the passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corsair Obelisk</ENAMEX> is the inevitable,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quaint Old Market</ENAMEX>. This is the old farmer‚Äôs market (mercado payes)
        where friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, vegetable, and flower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> set up their
        stands. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> is its busiest and most colourful time‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇan
        adventure in itself.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Dalt Vila</ENAMEX>
        ‚Ä¢Located opposite the market is the principal entrance to
        the walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalt Vila</ENAMEX>, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>. A ceremonial ramp
        leads across what used to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX> into an impressive gateway, over
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Portal de las Tables</ENAMEX>, the arch with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> inscription dating the
        wall to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1585</TIMEX>, during the reign of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Standing on
        either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> are headless, gracefully robed, white marble statues. They
        were unearthed on the spot during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> construction project.
        According to the barely decipherable <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> inscriptions, one of the
        statues honours a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX>; the other is a tribute from an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aristocratic Roman</ENAMEX> family to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juno</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-bulwark defences are almost completely
        intact. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> ancient gates into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and hist- orians
        claim the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX> initially constructed a wall here, though there
        are no remains of it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> built a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>, of which towers
        and remnants are still evident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The present bulwarks date back to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1554</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, ordered that the
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31‚ÅÑ2-metre-</NUMEX>thick (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6-foot</NUMEX>) wall be reconstructed. The fortifications are
        a prime surviving testimony to the military technology of the time and
        have been proclaimed a national monument.
        ‚Ä¢The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> through the great wall leads to a classic
        quadrangle fit for royal reviews. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX> there‚Äôs no more pomp under
        the porticos; instead, a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">artisans vie</ENAMEX> for display space to
        peddle their jewellery and leatherwork, which is often relatively
        original and cheap. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patio de Armas</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal square</ENAMEX>, as the quad
        is called, leads into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of a number of wide, open plazas which
        come upon you unannounced as you climb the maze of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢In the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of steep, cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, curious dead
        ends, and unexpected vistas, a map isn‚Äôt really necessary. The most
        important directions are simply up and down: up leads eventually to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX> and fortress commanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX>, and down inevitably
        leads to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gates through the wall to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. The
        variations are almost infinite, and this is one time when wrong turns
        can actually be recommended, for every zig-zag is likely to bring
        another delight‚<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> sweep of bougain¬≠villaea, a Baroque doorway, a
        fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>, or a new perspective on the sea and city
        below.
        ‚Ä¢When you reach an impressive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> and whitewashed town hall, you may feel that you‚Äôve come to the
        top of the town‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut you haven‚Äôt. Catch your breath here and admire
        the view down the cliffside from the edge of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> before
        continuing to ascend the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Suddenly</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find yourself in another cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> on your right was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX> on the site
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. It was subsequently renovated in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th and 18th centuries</TIMEX>. The resulting architectural eccentricities
        on the outside are matched in interest by a number of medieval works of
        art inside (admission fee). More works can be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> (admission is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 100 pe¬≠setas</NUMEX>). One
        oddity to note: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">la catedral de Santa Maria de las</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of the Snows)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> rather offbeat choice of a patron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saint</ENAMEX> for this sunny part of the world.
        ‚Ä¢Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Arqueol√≤gic de Dalt</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX>), which houses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> archaeological collections
        (together constituting one of the world‚Äôs great treasuries of
        Carthaginian art; see also page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>). All the relics on display were
        discovered on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>; they range from statues and urns to priceless
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jewellery</ENAMEX> and coins.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Many</ENAMEX> of the items are self-explanatory, which is fortunate
        as most descriptions are printed in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> only. Keep in mind the
        formula for dates: III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siglo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">a. J.C.</ENAMEX> means <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third century b.c.</TIMEX> ; XII
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siglo d. J.C.</ENAMEX> means <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th century</TIMEX> a.d.
        ‚Ä¢The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> is compact enough to be covered in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX>. Later on, try to pick your way over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Portal Nou</ENAMEX>, another
        gateway through the great wall, where you‚Äôll find yourself in the
        modern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> (long) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> away is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Monografic Puig des</ENAMEX>
        Molins, a modern, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spacious ‚Äúnew town‚</ENAMEX>Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> built on the edge of a
        particularly attractive hill, covered with olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees wild flowers</ENAMEX> and
        which is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puig des Molins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windmills</ENAMEX>). Here the
        Carthaginians, and later the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, buried their dead with respectful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ritual</ENAMEX> (see also pages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-15</NUMEX>). The artefacts displayed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        were all unearthed on the spot, and again, the inscriptions are in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> only.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Outside</ENAMEX> and around the corner of the building you‚Äôll find
        a cavelike entrance to the necropolis itself, where several typical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial chambers</ENAMEX> have been cleared and illuminated; in all there are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 4,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vaults</ENAMEX>. After you‚Äôve seen the works of art which were buried
        next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, the crypt shouldn‚Äôt seem too gloomy a sight. If you
        feel a little claustrophobic though, then wander to the far side of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX> for a view of the sea. Nearby is the beach of Figueretes
        (translated as ‚Äúthe little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fig trees‚Äù</ENAMEX>), a popular place for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bathing</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Sant Antoni Abad</ENAMEX>
        ‚Ä¢Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX> was a fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> tucked
        into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pine trees</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end of a magnificent bay. Nowadays the bay
        is so cluttered with all kinds of yachts, fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>,
        ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>-bottom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, and even workaday <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">freighters</ENAMEX> that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> has become something of a full-fledged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of
        white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skyscrapers</ENAMEX>. Rather than being a capital or trade centre, though,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX> is the throbbing heart of package-tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, and instead
        of occupying just a corner of the bay, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> extends for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢The newer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> have been built on distant beaches,
        providing doorstep swimming and sunbathing but requiring a ride to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shopping</ENAMEX> and nightlife. Conversely, if you‚Äôre staying in town, you‚Äôll
        have to travel to find a desirable beach. Bus services go everywhere,
        and there are ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>, too. Either way, because of the
        distances involved it‚Äôs worthwhile taking time to plan each day‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">programme</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself is a hotch potch of old stucco <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and
        luxurious new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. Traditionally, activity was centred four
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> up the hill from the seafront. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, white
        and solid, is fronted by an attractive patio accentuating its gentle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arches</ENAMEX>. Like many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, it was built as a combination
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> of worship and fortress.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Ä¢The waterfront</ENAMEX> provides a pleasant sightseeing stroll. At
        the imposing, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> you can gaze on a dreamworthy fleet of
        sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and motor yachts. Some are designed for the daring,
        others for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cocktails</ENAMEX>-on-the-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">poop</NUMEX>-deck <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>. Either way, it‚Äôs cheap
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entertainment‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthere‚Äôs</ENAMEX> no charge for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> watching.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Ä¢The centre</ENAMEX> of activity is the maritime promenade (passeig
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mar√≠tim</ENAMEX>), a bayfront <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> area reclaimed from the sea and now covered
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, a fountain, benches, and a proliferation of
        outdoor caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢This</ENAMEX> is where the small ferry <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">boats‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmostly</ENAMEX> converted
        fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcompete</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>. They operate to beaches near
        and far (usually, but not necessarily, the farther the better), and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find that there‚Äôs a beach for every taste. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> might look for the gentlest incline of sand and the tiniest
        ripple of wavelets, while the snorkellers will probably be happier with
        a rocky coastline that attracts interesting sealife. All the beaches
        served by public transport have snack <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, beach chairs for hire, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">umbrellas</ENAMEX> and additional amenities to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> degree or another.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Note</ENAMEX> that no <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> beach maintains <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lifeguards</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢The municipal bus <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is next to the bayfront
        promenade, virtually on the sea itself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Buses</ENAMEX> to the beaches are
        cheaper and faster than the ferries, if less adventurous. However,
        service is restricted to beaches close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>. Due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">geographical</ENAMEX> and historical factors, no one has ever built a
        round-the-coast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, thus many of the best beaches can be reached only
        by dusty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> more suitable for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢Dominating the mouth of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sant Antoni Bay</ENAMEX> is the gaunt
        silhouette of the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coniera</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conejera</ENAMEX> (meaning ‚Äúrabbit‚Äôs
        warren‚Äù or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúburrow‚Äù</ENAMEX>). According to legend this uninhabited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> was
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Carthaginian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannibal</ENAMEX>. Its other
        claim to fame is an automatic lighthouse whose signal can be seen <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) away.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢From Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coniera</ENAMEX> appears to be almost hope-lessly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhospitable</ENAMEX>, but a tiny hidden harbour makes it possible for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moor</ENAMEX> here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is well covered with tenacious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pines</ENAMEX>, a
        delightful variety of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> of friendly lizards. The
        swimming is unsuitable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and the area has an overpopulation
        of sea <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">urchins</ENAMEX> whose spiny quills are a menace to tender feet.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Santa Eul√†ria del Riu</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Tourists</ENAMEX> arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Eul√</ENAMEX>†ria may be forgiven if they
        wander about looking for the centre of town. It‚Äôs not at the top of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX>, where a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">medieval fortress-church</ENAMEX> makes a pretty picture against
        the blue sky, and it‚Äôs not at the seafront, where a flower-decked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promenade</ENAMEX> overlooks a thin crescent of sandy beach.
        ‚Ä¢If the island‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has any centre at all,
        it‚Äôs the sleepy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in front of the sagging old police <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX>. The
        monument in the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> recalls a shipwreck of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1913</TIMEX>, and a fountain
        on the far side features bizarre fish statues complete with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX> of
        water which spurt from their mouths. Across the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is the start
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX> laid out in the style of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barcelona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs gracious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramblas</ENAMEX>,
        but in tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Eul√</ENAMEX>†ria the effect is somewhat muted. The tree-lined
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avenue</ENAMEX> extends <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than three</NUMEX> blocks to the sea.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Santa Eul√†ria</ENAMEX> was the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibiza</ENAMEX> to attract
        foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">visitors‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdecades</ENAMEX> before the invention of the package
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">tour‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> a significant (and in some cases notorious) <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> of
        foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> has grown up here, scattered around the
        local area. One fortunate result of this community‚Äôs influence has been
        the proliferation of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> from which
        to choose.
        ‚Ä¢In the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Eul√</ENAMEX>†ria was primarily a market centre
        for the rich <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> of the northeastern quadrant of the island. Now it
        has become the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centre</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> based as far up and down
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort areas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Canar</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Can√°</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala Llonga</ENAMEX>,
        both of which are linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Eul√</ENAMEX>†ria by bus and ferry.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢The only ‚Äúmust‚Äù</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is the old white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX>, which is surrounded by those distinctive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cube</NUMEX>-shaped
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that are so typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ibicenco</ENAMEX> architecture. The ensemble looks
        different from each direction and at various times of day, and has insp
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ired a hundred</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and every amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> within
        range. Some of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> are admirably decorated
        with flower gardens, and all have a panoramic view of the sea or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountains</ENAMEX>, or both.
        ‚Ä¢From the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puig de Missa</ENAMEX> you can look down onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eul√†ria‚Äôs</ENAMEX> noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúriver‚Äù</ENAMEX> (a trickle, in fact) and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> that
        span it. The modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, just wide enough for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> to pass,
        parallels a low footbridge which is apparently of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> construction.
        According to island legend the low <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> was built in one furious
        night by the devil himself. If you‚Äôre not one to be put off by
        superstition, stroll down to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cobbled bridge</ENAMEX> and cross over into
        a quieter, more peaceful world.
        ‚Ä¢Inland
        ‚Ä¢Two <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> connect <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>, the shorter
        route passing through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Rafel</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">white church</ENAMEX> is
        relatively modern, but stately in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> colonial way. A sightseeing
        bonus here is that from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> in front of the church there‚Äôs an
        unexpectedly stirring aerial view of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orange</ENAMEX> groves sprawl
        on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza‚ÄìSant Rafel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, cutting through the
        attractive, parched landscape. The drawback is that this is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">east‚Äìwest thoroughfare</ENAMEX>: traffic can be heavy and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> somewhat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capricious</ENAMEX>. Watch out for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> passing illegally and other potential
        dangers.
        ‚Ä¢The more circuitous road between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>
        runs in sight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Agust√≠n.</ENAMEX> There‚Äôs not much to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, though
        the site is attractive. You may want to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, which is the
        area‚Äôs most prominent structure. If you walk to the rear door and rouse
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> who lives at the back in stoical underemployment, he‚Äôll open
        the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> and leave you to inspect the
        blue-and-white tiles on the walls, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baroque</ENAMEX>-style altar, and his own
        minute kitchen beyond. Have a look, too, at the round defence tower
        across the road, which has been converted for use as a family
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dwelling</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Farther</ENAMEX> along, you come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Jos√©p</ENAMEX>, a village known for
        its handicrafts where several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> sell local embroidery and
        souvenirs. Not far from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Jos√©p</ENAMEX>, just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cova Santa</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Cave</ENAMEX>). Unfortunately, nobody seems to know how it got its name.
        Whatever the story, this privately owned cave, of modest proportions,
        is open to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> for a small fee.
        ‚Ä¢Another side trip along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Jos√</ENAMEX>©p <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sa</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talaia</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atalaya</ENAMEX>), highest point on the island. A chancy road winding
        up to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">475</NUMEX>-metre (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,560-foot</NUMEX>) summit is likely to test the engine
        and suspension of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, as well as your own persistence. The view
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, the sea, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> mainland is worth it, however.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢A</ENAMEX> short drive or a hefty hike north of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> is the
        village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J√©sus</ENAMEX>, with a particularly moody <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. Like
        many of the rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs often closed and locked. If you‚Äôre
        lucky enough to gain entry, you‚Äôll see the only major work of art on
        the whole island: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> triptych, or altar retable, which is
        attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodrigo de Osona</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Most</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX> are worth a visit for their
        architectural, scenic, or historical merits. Note the black crosses
        painted on the white walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that are situated near a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>,
        reminders of the devotional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> of the cross celebrated on Good
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">few miles</NUMEX> southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX> is the medieval church
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Jordi</ENAMEX>, combining gracious arches with no-nonsense defensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bulwarks</ENAMEX>. On the northern side of the island, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> church
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Miquel</ENAMEX> affords a hilltop view of the distant sea. The cruciform
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edifice</ENAMEX> is graced with black-and-white fresco decorations, and in the
        churchyard there is a fascinating collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiques</ENAMEX>, including a
        wine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> and a grain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX>. The church‚Äôs ample patio, dating from the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX>, is now taken over regularly for folklore exhibitions in
        which a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> perform to the vigorous accompaniment of
        traditional musical instruments (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Houses</ENAMEX> are sparse‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin terms of both furniture and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">build‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfrom</ENAMEX> here across the fertile valley to the sea. Some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homes</ENAMEX> have their own built-in baking ovens, which are still used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>.
        The pattern of cobblestone and brick on the floor of some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barns</ENAMEX> is
        worth a peek.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢You</ENAMEX> may want to visit some of the other inland

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">105 miles</NUMEX>) of coastline, so much the better. You still can reach
        many of its fine beaches and much of its glorious coastline. But note:
        in the absence of a coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, you often have to go far inland if
        you want to travel from one beach to another.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Ä¢To</ENAMEX> start at the top of the compass and work clockwise
        around the island: the northernmost tourist centre is Portinatx
        (pronounced port-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ee</NUMEX>-NATCH). To get there from the fertile farmland of
        the centre of the island you drive over substantial hills, alongside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cliffs</ENAMEX>, and finally down to an unexpectedly placid sea. The natural
        beauty of the area‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsandy beaches, weird rock formations, and plenty
        of juniper and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pine trees‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhasn‚Äôt</ENAMEX> escaped the developers‚Äô notice, but
        the local guides still won‚Äôt allow you to miss this site‚Äôs two
        historical claims to fame. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>, during <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> naval manoeuvres
        just off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX> came ashore here. Immediately, the
        name of the place was officially changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portinatx del Rey</ENAMEX> (of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">king</ENAMEX>). Slightly more recently, part of the film <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pacific</ENAMEX> was shot
        on the beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portinatx</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Ä¢The</ENAMEX> next major point of interest is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala de Sant Vicen√ß</ENAMEX>, a
        splendid cove which is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort centre</ENAMEX>. While exceptionally hilly
        and circuitous, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is good enough to handle a stream of tourist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, and the beach itself is likely to be crowded. Up in the hills
        behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cala Sant Vicen√ß‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> rough hike over difficult terrain‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cave</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Es Cuieram</ENAMEX> (see also pages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14-15</NUMEX>). A great many

        the artefacts can be viewed at the archaeological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalt Vila</ENAMEX>.
        Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave</ENAMEX> itself is a good place to seek temporary shelter

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Much</ENAMEX> of the coastline south from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Sant Vicen√</ENAMEX>ß is good,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Just</ENAMEX> about directly offshore from here lies the island of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boats</ENAMEX>. Although the beach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tagomago</ENAMEX> is too narrow for sunbathing, the
        swimming is superb. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worth the trouble to ramble up to the
        extraordinary lighthouse at the top of the hill past various abandoned
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">farms</ENAMEX>, wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and sweeping sea vistas.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Es Canar</ENAMEX>, the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibicenco</ENAMEX> spelling for a variously
        misspelt beach, has become a major tourist centre, with abundant

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Hikers</ENAMEX> may want to try the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Canar</ENAMEX> all
        the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Eul√†ria</ENAMEX> and beyond. It winds its way past piney coves,
        mysterious cliffs, and quiet beaches. For some this may sound like hard
        work, but don‚Äôt despair: beach-bar refreshment is never far away.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Cala Llonga</ENAMEX>, to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Eul√†ria</ENAMEX>, is just what
        its name <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">describes‚Äà‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> long cove which, from several vantage points,
        looks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> fjord. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotels</ENAMEX> and apartment construction push
        back into the hills, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>-trippers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX>
        Eul√†ria throng the deep, sandy beach. But thankfully, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Llonga‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        worst problems are a thing of the past, and pollution, which was once
        rampant, has been halted by the construction of a sewage plant some
        distance away.
        ‚Ä¢An impressive rocky coastline with a backdrop of verdant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hills</ENAMEX> continues southward to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talamanca</ENAMEX>, a heavily developed beach with
        a fine view of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ibiza Town</ENAMEX>. On the other side of the capital is the
        hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figueretas</ENAMEX>, and then the long, straight seafront beach
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playa D‚ÄôEn Bossa</ENAMEX>. This was once the scene of a famous misdevelopment
        plan, when a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX>-room luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> had to be demolished just as it was
        ready to open for business, since it had mistakenly been built directly
        on the flight path to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibiza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢At the southern extremity of the island, near the salt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flats</ENAMEX>, are some hard-to-reach, mostly unspoiled beaches. Among them is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Playa Cavallet</ENAMEX>, which is officially reserved for nude bathing. Other
        nearby attractions include the quarrying operation itself and the port
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Canal</ENAMEX>, from where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> is exported. The sprawling salt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flats‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇnearly <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">400 hectares</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">990 acres</NUMEX>) at or just below sea
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">level‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhave</ENAMEX> a fascination of their own. The white mountains of dry
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">salt</ENAMEX> and the shimmering patterns on the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> make it a sort of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dead Sea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outpost</ENAMEX> in an otherwise green and hospitable land. Providing
        the mainstay of the economy for this area, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">54,400 metric tons</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60,000 tons</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> a year are harvested here.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Ä¢More sand</ENAMEX> or rock beaches continue westward from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX>, but they become less and less accessible. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">scen-ery</ENAMEX> is more
        spectacular towards the southwest corner of the island, where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hamlet of Es Cubells</ENAMEX>, reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Jos√©p</ENAMEX>, occupies a
        land‚Äôs-end position overlooking rocks and the blue sea. A theological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seminary</ENAMEX> is idyllically perched above the rocky crest. Not far away,
        around the coast, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôHort, a small, isolated cove with clear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. This is an attractive enough place in its own right, but it is
        enhanced by the spectacular views of the small island of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Vedr√†</ENAMEX>,
        which just seems to rise from nowhere out of the ocean.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢The western</ENAMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>, leading up toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX>, comes under the jurisdiction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Jos√©p.</ENAMEX> It includes some of

        for that matter.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Ä¢Fanatics</ENAMEX> dispute the merits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala Bassa, Cala Badella</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala T√°rida</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala Conta</ENAMEX>, but each has something special to offer.
        At these coves, you can enjoy crystal-clear, clean <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and gently
        sloping white sandy beaches. There are good road connections between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX> and both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cala T√°rida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cala Badella</ENAMEX>, with the result that
        both bays have now been developed. You can reach <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cala Bassa</ENAMEX> and Cala
        Conta, too, by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> (there‚Äôs a bus service), or by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. The
        combination of red and greyish rocks, the white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX>, the green pines,
        and the rich blue sky and sea is striking. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent times</TIMEX> the caves
        nearby have become a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> for the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Sawyers</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Ä¢Past the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coves</ENAMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Antoni</ENAMEX>, the rest of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">circle</ENAMEX> is something of a no-man‚Äôs land of relatively fierce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">seas</ENAMEX> and cruel rocks. No real road leads to the coast in this whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quadrant</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major exception. The beach called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Port de Sant</ENAMEX>
        Miquel, which once had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balanzat</ENAMEX>, is a deep inlet
        with white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and pinewoods, situated far below and beyond the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant Mique</ENAMEX>. However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">inlet</ENAMEX> has been
        engulfed by an outburst of sleekly modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Fortunately, Sant
        Miquel beach holds little attraction fortourists staying in these
        air-conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, as they all have their own swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and
        bar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">service‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich</ENAMEX> is just as well, since the beach couldn‚Äôt
        comfortably accommodate them all at once.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Other</ENAMEX> than walking in the wooded hills, the most popular
        local attraction is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cova de Can Mar√ßa</ENAMEX>, a cave where sound and light
        effects enhance the natural wonders of stalagmites and stalactites.
        ‚Ä¢Formentera
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">‚Ä¢Less than four nautical miles</NUMEX> separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera</ENAMEX>, with
        its long sandy beaches, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ibiza</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the language are the
        same, yet the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands couldn‚Äôt be farther removed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera</ENAMEX> has
        no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">airport‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnor</ENAMEX> are there any plans to build one‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand a ferry and
        hydrofoil service provide the only inter-island links. This Balearic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outpost</ENAMEX> boasts a sizeable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> lake but no fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Cisterns, some
        of them dating from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX> times, catch whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> falls from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sky</ENAMEX>, and when needed, supplementary water supplies are shipped in to
        this desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Ä¢Potential</ENAMEX> water shortages have not been enough to stop the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>, however, and hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> and scores of new apartment
        blocks line the beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Pujols</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mitjorn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Cal√≥</ENAMEX>, and Cala
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sahona</ENAMEX>. These centres attract most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and summer
        residents, who swell the permanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 5,000</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> or more. The impact of this seasonal influx of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> (mainly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>) has been dramatic. Still, there‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to
        spare on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Ä¢Constrained</ENAMEX> by the limited water supply and the absence of
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, the pace of construction and change have been kept within
        reasonable bounds, with regulations stipulating, for instance, that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> may not rise <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">higher than four storeys</NUMEX>. Traffic, also, has
        been controlled, and if you‚Äôre staying here you might want to consider
        getting around by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX>; there‚Äôs no better way to explore an island
        that measures no more than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">121‚ÅÑ2 miles</NUMEX>) from end to end,
        one-fifth the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, choose from small Land
        Rover‚Äìtype <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>, scooters, and mopeds. If you come to Formentera
        just for a day, then the best option is car rental (or scooter/moped):
        although the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is small, it is too large to see all in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bicycle</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt rely on public transport, either, because the bus
        service is extremely limited.
        ‚Ä¢But most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> prefer to linger in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Formentera</ENAMEX>. They‚Äôre
        attracted by the sun and sea, by the incomparable beaches, and by some
        of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">windsurfing</ENAMEX> and scuba diving in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>.
        Beautiful sandy beaches like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Platja de Mitjorn</ENAMEX> go on for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX>. Here
        and elsewhere, you‚Äôll see many nude sunbathers, and toplessness is the
        order of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. So far, nude bathing has been legalized only on the
        isolated beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illetas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Llevant</ENAMEX>, but it is practised virtually
        everywhere. As a rule, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> take no notice and you‚Äôre free to
        sunbathe as you please.
        ‚Ä¢For all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Formentera‚Äôs</ENAMEX> happy-go-lucky ways, traditions are
        still firmly entrenched. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Farmers</ENAMEX> continue as precariously as ever,
        scratching a living from the arid, rocky soil. Wheat, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oats</ENAMEX>
        are the most significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> having been cultivated since
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, when the island was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frumenteria</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúwheat
        producer. ‚Äù Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        distinctive dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red wine</ENAMEX>, vino de pag√©s, and almond and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fig trees</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thrive</ENAMEX>, but the olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> here bear little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢Life</ENAMEX> still revolves around stuccoed farmhouses with tiled
        roofs and columned verandahs. Lush red, juicy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>, threaded
        together in garlands, hang from the rafters to dry, while almonds are
        shelled for sale to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>, figs, and the fruit
        of an industrious winter‚Äôs knitting: gloves, scarves, caps, socks, and
        pullovers fashioned from local, coarse, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream-coloured homespun wool</ENAMEX>.
        No matter how enthusiastically they welcome tourism, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> seem
        reluctant to abandon a rural lifestyle‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich further enhances the

        ‚Ä¢More glorious still is the panorama from the mirador above
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Cal√≥</ENAMEX>. This lookout is one of the highest spots on the island. You
        can‚Äôt miss the lookout point: it stands right alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> view of the narrow spine of land that connects eastern Formentera
        to the island‚Äôs western <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>. The white expanse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Platja de Mitjorn</ENAMEX>,
        clearly visible on the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX>, is paralleled by the rocky strip
        of beach on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Cal√≥</ENAMEX> side. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Es Cal√≥‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tiny harbour dates from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        times, when it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Formentera‚</ENAMEX>Äôs only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>. Nowadays it is yet another
        target for tourist development, and there are already several small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> set amongst the pinewoods.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Ä¢After Es Cal√≥</ENAMEX>, return along the main trans-island road to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant Ferran</ENAMEX>, a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> with a pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. From there, take
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> back to the coast and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Es Pujols</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">premier</ENAMEX> resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. Scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX> cater
        for the primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, and the beach is usually awash with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lounge chairs</ENAMEX> and sunbaked bodies, pedalos, and windsurfing gear.
        Farther west there are some less populous stretches where you can swim
        in relative seclusion or eat at a simple beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt expect
        much in the way of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>; these simple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX> are intended
        to be dismantled at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of every season</TIMEX>, when the area returns to
        its unadulterated form.
        ‚Ä¢The oldest construction on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Formentera‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa dolmen</ENAMEX>, or
        prehistoric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone circle‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇlies</ENAMEX> not far from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Es Pujols at Ca Na Costa</ENAMEX>
        (between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Sabina</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Formentera‚Äôs salt</ENAMEX> lake). Although the
        site is still under excavation, you can visit it. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> has been
        erected to protect the limestone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monoliths</ENAMEX> from the elements. Also in
        the area are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formentera‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt pans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Las Salinas</ENAMEX>. To reach the salt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">lakes</ENAMEX>, follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Sabina</ENAMEX> before turning
        right, eastwards, down a rough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>, at the end of which turn left. In
        use since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt pans</ENAMEX> are the source of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18,000</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">metric tons</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20,000 tons</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> has large crystals
        (which have a higher density than those from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>) and is considered
        excellent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">curing fish</ENAMEX>. The export point is, of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">La Sabina</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and last port of call on any round-island jaunt.
