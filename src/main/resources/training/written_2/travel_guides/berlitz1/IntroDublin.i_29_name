        As capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most explosive economy, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> seems
        to be changing before your very eyes. New construction is everywhere,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> buzz, traffic is increasingly congested, and in the
        frenetic pace of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hour</TIMEX> everyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> seems intent on changing
        places with everyone else. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are crowded with people
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bent</ENAMEX> on having a good time. Prosperity is in the air; the roar of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúCeltic Tiger‚</ENAMEX>Äù can clearly be heard.
        But this is not the whole picture. The proverbial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitality</ENAMEX> and warm welcome are still here. This busy, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European</ENAMEX>
        city sits on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">history‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhistory</ENAMEX> is present
        everywhere, from elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Merrion Square</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> holes on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Post Office</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the imagination, reinvented
        and reappraised in the literature of its exiles. And the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> is
        with us, too‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe irreverent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of wit and charm and that peculiar
        magic possessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX>.
        Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preservation</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> excels in packaging its past for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>. You
        can view artifacts from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronze Age</ENAMEX>, trace the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>
        Rising, or revisit <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leopold Bloom‚Äôs odyssey in Ulysses</ENAMEX>. Old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
        are being recycled; for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Hospital</ENAMEX> now
        holds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>, a city large in
        expectations, is still small enough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to see most of its
        sights on foot.
        City on the Liffey
        The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin Bay</ENAMEX>. The river forms a natural line between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX> and south sections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. This geography is important in
        understanding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>. Historically and culturally this north-south
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distinction</ENAMEX> has always been significant, and it still is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, with a
        dose of good-humored rivalry between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas. ‚Äú I never go north
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liffey</ENAMEX>,‚Äù <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> remarked.
        Farther out, both north and south, are the sweeping curves
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canals</ENAMEX>. The occasional cry of gulls and
        unexpected distant vistas will remind you that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> is by the sea,
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wicklow mountains</ENAMEX>, which hold <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> closely to the coast, are
        visible from everywhere.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dublin</ENAMEX> is an intimate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, physically small but tightly
        packed, a perfect place for walking. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Green</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College</ENAMEX>, provides a natural focus just south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">O‚ÄôConnell Street</ENAMEX>
        bridge. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">O‚ÄôConnell Street</ENAMEX>, the city‚Äôs grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX>, leads north to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parnell Square</ENAMEX>. To the south and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Stephen‚Äôs Green</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgian Dublin</ENAMEX> where the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> are located. Along the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liffey</ENAMEX> to the west is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Temple Bar</ENAMEX>, center of nightlife and home to many
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dublin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cutting-edge artists</ENAMEX> and artistic endeavors. Up the hill
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Temple Bar</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dublin Castle and Christ Church Cathedral</ENAMEX>.
        It won‚Äôt <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> on you in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> all the time. The climate
        here can best be described as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúchangeable‚Äù</ENAMEX> and yet the sudden shifts
        from light to dark, sunshine to shower, are part of the city‚Äôs magic.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Buildings</ENAMEX> seem to transform themselves depending on the light; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>
        under a lowering sky is a different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">place</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> in sunshine.
        Enjoying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>
        Literature has always flourished in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX>, the only city
        to have produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winners</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">literature‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇYeats</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shaw</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckett</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX>, the high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> of literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Modernism</ENAMEX>,
        imagined and interpreted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> for the world in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ulysses</ENAMEX> (you‚Äôll see
        references to it all over). However, sometimes it seems that the city
        produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> of this stature by accident, even against its will.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce</ENAMEX>, among others, had to leave their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">understand it‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> to be understood.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> theater is legendary, and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> should miss
        seeing a performance at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey Theatre</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate Theatre</ENAMEX>. The city‚Äôs
        impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">U2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geldof</ENAMEX> is well known‚<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthere‚Äôs</ENAMEX> even a self-guided tour of their haunts.
        Traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> music is also alive and well, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX>,
        and there has been a revival of storytelling, poetry reading, and
        traditional dancing. And in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, where literature and theater
        have historically dominated the scene, visual arts are finally coming
        into their own with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Modern Art</ENAMEX> and the many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>
        that display the work of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>.
        The constantly crowded and busy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grafton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the most
        visible center for shopping, but there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> all over that carry an
        international array of goods as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> crafts and souvenirs
        you expect. And while multinational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> have made inroads, they seem
        less blatant here than elsewhere. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and also <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and guest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, have been owned and managed by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, and
        theirs is the welcome of traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> hospitality.
        Dublin‚Äôs food has undergone a metamorphosis. There was a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> when you might have apologized for it, but no longer. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dublin</ENAMEX> has
        international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> galore, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Irish Cuisine</ENAMEX> is built
        upon fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ireland‚</ENAMEX>Äôs seas, rivers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coffee</ENAMEX> has
        replaced the ubiquitous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇDublin</ENAMEX> is now almost as much a coffee
        city as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vienna</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Countryside</ENAMEX>
        In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of such human proportions it is not surprising
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> in the northwest is the largest open space, but squares like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen‚Äôs Green</ENAMEX> are the garden oases of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        On the coast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandymount, Dollymount</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Killiney</ENAMEX> strands
        are the places to go. The beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wicklow Mountains</ENAMEX>, and the Wicklow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mountains National Park</ENAMEX> provide a more rugged countryside, and the area
        has breathtaking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and gardens such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castletown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Usher</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powerscourt</ENAMEX>. To the north and west are the ancient sites of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malahide Castle</ENAMEX>, the evocative hill of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tara</ENAMEX>, and the long
        barrows of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knowth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newgrange</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DART</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dublin Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX>) runs north and south
        along the coast. It‚Äôs an ideal way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to reach outlying
        sights and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. There are many guided bus tours to sights outside
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and some are accessible by city <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX>.
        Young at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heart</ENAMEX>?
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dublin</ENAMEX> is a young <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Almost half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ireland‚</ENAMEX>Äôs population
        is under <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-five</TIMEX>, and with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> and professional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> also has a large student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>
        attract <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from all over the world, and this influx helps to make
        Dublin a busy, buzzing international <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. However, young and old,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubliner</ENAMEX> rub shoulders quite happily. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Religion</ENAMEX> and respect
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> has not yet gone out of fashion. And young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> are
        not leaving now‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmultinational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>
        investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home.
        Unemployment is at an all-time low. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> are actually beginning to
        come home.
