        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> is an outstanding shopping destination, given its
        long and proud craft heritage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is renowned worldwide for
        exquisite handmade lace and embroidery, well-crafted wicker items,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">gorgeous flowers</ENAMEX>, and long-lasting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Madeiran</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traditional</ENAMEX>,
        labor-intensive methods and quality are still respected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX>.
        Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> offers no tax
        con¬≠cessions for visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX>, so this is not the place to come in
        search of cheap electrical items, cameras, or watches.
        Best Buys
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Needlework</ENAMEX>. Madeira‚Äôs hand embroidery is unsurpassed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>. This disappearing art form‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇstill going strong in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeira‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis</ENAMEX> an amalgam of styles and techniques gathered over more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">150 years</TIMEX>. Along with fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, embroidery and lacemaking
        are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Madeira‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">superlative</ENAMEX> exports, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX> you have ample
        opportunity to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> or workshops where the final touches are
        put to these painstakingly produced items. However, you‚Äôre unlikely to
        see much of their actual manufacture, as the vast majority of the work
        is done in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (some estimate that upwards of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> are involved in the industry). Madeira creates and exports table
        linens, sheets, dresses, blouses, hand¬≠kerchiefs, and even wedding
        dresses of extraordinary delicacy. Tapestries range from copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
        Master paintings to traditional pastoral scenes.
        If <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">you‚Äôre</ENAMEX> used to machine-made, mass-produced embroidered
        items, you may be in for sticker shock: a full set of meticulously
        detailed table linens can take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to two years</TIMEX> to make, so prices
        aren‚Äôt cheap (although, measured as a reflection of someone‚Äôs salary
        for that length of time, they really are). If you value the time,
        effort, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> that goes into these items, the price is likely to
        seem reasonable.
        To be sure that any needlework item is the genuine article
        (as opposed to an inferior import or machine-made piece), look for a
        lead seal with an ‚ÄúM,‚Äù the emblem of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IBTAM‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmeaning it‚</ENAMEX>Äôs been
        certified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instituto de Bordado, Tape√</ENAMEX>ßaras e <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arte¬≠sanato da</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Madeiran Embroidery</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tapestry</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handicrafts</ENAMEX>),
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> island <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> that has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">showroom</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> on Rua
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visconde de Anadia</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>. There you‚Äôll find a tapestry known as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúAllegory of Madeira</ENAMEX>,‚Äù which employed a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated 7 million</NUMEX> stitches.
        Wicker. Basket weaving and willow work, another of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        most important export trades, also depend upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> working out of
        their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find an outstanding array of wicker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">items‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeverything</ENAMEX> from picnic baskets and trays to tables, chairs, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">decorative deer‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthroughout Madeira.</ENAMEX> While many items are attractive
        and inexpensive, the impracticality of taking them home‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇespecially
        since wicker is not expensive in most parts of the world‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmight
        suggest opting for other souvenir items. Accustomed to exporting,
        though, most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> will send large items to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> for you.
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourist shoppers</ENAMEX> to see wickerwork
        in the making, an activity more interesting than it sounds: items are
        crafted not only with the hands and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> but occasionally the teeth as
        well.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handicrafts</ENAMEX>. Though needlework and wicker are the biggest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX>, other craft items also make good souvenirs and gifts. Boots
        made from soft goat hide are part of the national costume (women‚Äôs
        versions have red leather trim around the ankle). The boot and leather
        goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seller</ENAMEX> just outside the entrance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚Äôs Mercado</ENAMEX> dos
        Lavradores market is worth a visit. The boots worn by the conductores
        who push the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">toboggans</ENAMEX> are available (as are the straw hats,
        old-style boaters, that they wear).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceramics</ENAMEX> and pottery are some of the most popular items
        throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>. Most of the items you‚Äôll find in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX>, like
        pretty hand-painted plates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">planters</ENAMEX>, jugs, and jars, come from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mainland‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut</ENAMEX> if you‚Äôre not traveling to other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> is still a good place to pick them up at bargain prices.
        Other items include marquetry, a recently revived island
        craft that is featured on small boxes and pictures, and furniture. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brinquinho</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs answer to the tambourine, in which miniature
        cymbals are clanged together by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">costumed dolls ‚Äúdancing‚Äù</ENAMEX> round a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maypole</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find thick <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knitwear‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpullovers</ENAMEX>, hats, and gloves‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇat
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> in the mountains. Unexpectedly chilly weather might make
        these a good impulse buy. Many of these wintry items are imported from
        the north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Flowers</ENAMEX>. After a stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôre likely to wish
        your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> could be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-tenth</NUMEX> as verdant and full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Creating a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lush Madeiran</ENAMEX> backyard won‚Äôt be easy, but you can still take home
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">souvenir flamingo flowers</ENAMEX> (anthuriums), <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-of-paradise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flowers</ENAMEX> (strelitzias, or estrel√≠cias in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>). The latter in
        particular will last quite a while after your return <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>
        will box these for storage in the airplane hold and deliver them either
        to your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> you leave. Taking delicate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bouquets</ENAMEX> onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> may prove a bit more complicated.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Food & Drink</ENAMEX>. Madeira <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> are extremely
        long-lasting, so you can safely bring some back. Genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Madeira</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bolo de mel</ENAMEX> (or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúhoney cake‚Äù</ENAMEX>), sold in many different sizes, is a far
        cry from what you get at home. It‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious</ENAMEX>, dark, heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX>,
        similar to gingerbread. Despite its name, it is made from molasses, not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">honey</ENAMEX>. It lasts for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to a year</TIMEX> and goes very well with a dry Madeira
        wine. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> also find traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biscuits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>, jams, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marmalades</ENAMEX>.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> take home a bottle or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> wine
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX>). Connoisseurs with money to burn hunt down vintage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bottles‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou</ENAMEX> can still turn up rare bottles like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1795</TIMEX> Barbeito
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terrantez</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malavasia Solera</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henriques & Henriques</ENAMEX>).
        Other alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> that you might want to take home
        include branquinha (aguardente with a stick of sugarcane in the
        bottle), or a local liqueur such as licor de maracuj√° (passionfruit) or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ginja</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry liqueur</ENAMEX>).
        Collecting. Madeira‚Äôs colorful stamps, as well as coins,
        bank notes, and other items like postcards are of interest to many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> specializing in all these items on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Av</ENAMEX>.
        Arriaga, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marina Shopping</ENAMEX>, shop C; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291/223 070</ENAMEX>).
        Where to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Funchal‚Äôs</ENAMEX> central area boasts the best variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and
        local products on the island. The main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fern√</ENAMEX>£o
        Ornelas, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ferreiros</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Queimada de Cima</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queimada de Baixo</ENAMEX>, which form
        the downtown of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are
        nostalgically small and personal.
        For the best possible introduction to all of the island‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handicrafts</ENAMEX> and saleable products, visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa do Turista</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rua</ENAMEX> do
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conselheiro & Jos√© Silvestre Ribeiro</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291/224 907</ENAMEX>) on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seafront</ENAMEX>. The first few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are carefully laid out with pieces of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antique shelving</ENAMEX> displaying fragile breakables; beyond them, you‚Äôll
        find a fairly conventional department store that stocks <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceramics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, embroidery, dolls, and inexpensive
        souvenirs. Out back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> is a ‚Äúmini-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>,‚Äù where a little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palheiro</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a weaving loom, and an
        old-fashioned shop re-create a bit of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>.
        Competing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa do Turista</ENAMEX> is the new indoor handicraft
        and tourist market at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eira do Serrado</ENAMEX>. It sells excellent lace and
        embroidered items (most items are cheaper than they are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>),
        leather goods, and a great selection of vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Madeiran wine</ENAMEX>, with
        bottles dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last century</TIMEX> (for a hefty price, of course).
        Look for an inn, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estalagem Eira do Serrado</ENAMEX>, to be built next to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caf√©</ENAMEX> here.
        For needlework, visit any of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>, which put
        the finishing touches on items and act principally as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">showrooms</ENAMEX>,
        selling direct to the public. The biggest and best-known is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patr√</ENAMEX>≠cio
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">& Gouveia Sucessores</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Visconde de Anadia</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. 291/222
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">723</NUMEX>); it offers tours on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekdays</TIMEX>. Keep an eye out for other outlets
        marked by small signs in doorways, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bordados Oliveira</ENAMEX> (Rua
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mur√ßas; Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291/229 340</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira Sup√©rbia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Carmo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291/224 023</ENAMEX>).
        While virtually every tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> displays wicker items,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caf√© Rel√≥gio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Largo da Achada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camacha</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291/922 114</ENAMEX>) wins for
        sheer volume. It is <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Madeira‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll Things Wicker</ENAMEX>,‚Äù with items ranging
        from the most conventional to the most implausible. Alternatively,
        there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sousa & Gon√ßalves</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Castanheiro</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>) and Unibasket
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Carmo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291/226 925</ENAMEX>), both in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>.
        There are flower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> set up along <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Av</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arriaga</ENAMEX> near the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>) and inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercado dos Lavradores</ENAMEX>. A shop
        specializing in selling and packaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> for long-distance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa das Flores A Rosa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua Imperatriz D. Am√©lia</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">126</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291/228 800</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> order flowers
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> before departure.
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Madeira</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX>, the most atmospheric place to shop is
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Adegas de S√£o Francisco</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>), on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Av</ENAMEX>. Arriaga next to the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENTERTAINMENT</ENAMEX>
        Madeira can‚Äôt rank with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearic</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> for
        nighttime entertainment; it‚Äôs a much more low-key place. Although
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> has its share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pubs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>, and even a well attended
        casino with revues, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> don‚Äôt come to the island for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>
        entertainment.
        The nucleus of the tourist nightlife scene consists mainly
        of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and their bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nightclubs</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚Äôs Casino</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Madeira</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida do Infante</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">291/231 121</ENAMEX>), near the Pestana
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carlton Park Resort & Casino</ENAMEX>, you can play blackjack, roulette, and
        take a turn at the slot machines. An admission fee is charged (good for
        a free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> and chips in the amount of admission); you will need to
        take your passport if you wish to do more than hit the ground-level
        slot machines (the real gambling is upstairs). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> is open until
        3am <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun‚ÄìThur</ENAMEX>, and until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4am</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sat</ENAMEX>.

        Folk-dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evenings</ENAMEX> are a regular feature at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>; and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> popular tour is a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camacha‚Äôs Caf√© Rel√≥gio</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>),

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚Äôs Teatro Municipal</ENAMEX> is the only place that regularly
        stages more theatrical entertainment. It is worth a visit, if only to
        see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> itself. Dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1888</TIMEX>, it has recently been restored
        to its original splendor, and produces most of the performing arts. It
        is the centerpiece of the annual music festival, here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> (see
        below).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Madeira Amateur Dramatic Society</ENAMEX>, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, puts

        Festivals
        Madeira celebrates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major festivals, among the best
        times to visit the island if you don‚Äôt mind crowds.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX>. Staged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> (and occasionally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> is celebrated through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">samba rhythms‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> expect the hedonism or
        sensuality of the type of celebrations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenerife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> is much too restrained for that and, besides, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> is
        strictly small scale.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Flower Festival</ENAMEX>. This festival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late April</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early May</TIMEX>
        is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> pleaser. It includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">floats‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdecorated</ENAMEX> in beautiful and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">inventive floral creations‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇparading</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Two
        events peripheral to the main parade should not be missed. One is the
        children‚Äôs parade, in which each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> carries a single flower and then
        places it in a hole in a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúWall of Hope‚Äù in the Pra√ßa do Mu¬≠ni¬≠c√≠pio</ENAMEX>.
        Covered in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, the wall is a moving sight. Once the parade is
        finished, an exhibition of the award-winning <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and displays is
        put on in a lovely old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rua</ENAMEX> dos <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castanheiros</ENAMEX>.
        Wine <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX>. Festivals take place in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> to
        celebrate the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> harvest. You may even see boracheiros, men
        sampling the goods from traditional goat-skin bags once used to store
        and carry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>.
        New Year‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX>. Madeira‚Äôs biggest and most spectacular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">festival</ENAMEX> has earned a worldwide reputation. It jams <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚Äôs hotels</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>; you will need to book accommodation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX> in advance
        and pay a hefty premium. (Ironically, it‚Äôs the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> of the year
        when you get the least sleep. ) Many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> anchor in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31</TIMEX> to take part in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11pm</TIMEX>, all
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in town switch on all their lights, opening all the doors
        and windows, setting the hillside ablaze in light. The cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>
        crank up their flood lights, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> begin. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the New Year</TIMEX>
        rings in, a splendid fireworks display erupts.
        Several religious festivals also take place throughout the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, but one especially stands out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Feast of the Assumption</ENAMEX>, known
        more parochially as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Festival</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora do Monte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte</ENAMEX>), is celebrated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14‚Äì15</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX>. Pilgrims flock from all
        around the island to kiss the image of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>, and some
        ascend the final <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> steps to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> on their knees.
        To many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Madeirans</ENAMEX> who believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX> has carried
        them through troubled times, the pilgrimage is an obligation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> is akin to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lourdes</ENAMEX> for these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeirans</ENAMEX>. The sick and crippled
        arrive in droves in search of miracle cures. Once the pious devotions
        are over, however, wine flows, fireworks explode, espetada (kebab)
        stalls flourish, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte</ENAMEX> regains normality for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another 363 days</TIMEX>.
        Sports
        With no beaches to speak of, and scarcely enough flat
        ground for a playing surface, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> may not be the first destination
        that springs to mind for a sporting holiday. However, there are
        sufficient opportunities for most active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX>, and excellent
        ones for those who enjoy walking and hiking.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectator Sports</ENAMEX>. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> sport on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> (soccer). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Islanders</ENAMEX> are just as wild about futebol as
        mainlanders, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs premier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> division of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX>, plays at the fine local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> (on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua Dr. Pita</ENAMEX>)
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>. See the local newspaper for schedule.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walking & Hiking</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mountainous Madeira</ENAMEX>, with its unique
        network of levada <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>), is perfect for walkers of all
        ages and abilities. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">watercourses</ENAMEX> exist outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX>, but
        nowhere are they so accessible and do they cover such great area. The
        island‚Äôs irrigation system is composed of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,150km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,350 miles</NUMEX>) of
        channels. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> are mostly gentle but exhilarating just the same
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        More serious trekkers, with cross-country or mountain
        walking on their minds (and in their legs), can choose from a number of
        recommended hikes, including:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boca da Corrida ‚Äì Encumeada</ENAMEX> (moderate; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 hours</TIMEX>): views of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curral das Freiras</ENAMEX> and the valley of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ribeiro do Poco</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico do Arieiro ‚Äì Pico Ruivo ‚Äì Achada do Teixeira</ENAMEX> (moderate
        to difficult; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>): a journey to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest peak.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponta de S√£o Louren√ßo</ENAMEX> (moderate; <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX>): great rock
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>, and views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cani√ßal tunnel ‚Äì Boca do Risca ‚Äì Larano</ENAMEX> (easy; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>): a walk along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north coast</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boca</ENAMEX> do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Risco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto da</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cruz</ENAMEX>; terrific <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> and sea views.
        All of these treks can be undertaken alone by experienced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">walkers</ENAMEX> or under the watchful eye of local guides. See ‚ÄúGuides and
        Tours‚Äù on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX> for information on local outfitters that organize
        guided walks.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Golf</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Golf</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX> is a year-round sport; the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> has
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> holes of championship golf divided between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>, both
        esteemed for their scenic beauty. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Every spring</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Madeira Island Open</ENAMEX>,
        part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.G.A. European Tour</ENAMEX>, takes place at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santo da Serra Golf</ENAMEX>

        Designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Trent Jones</ENAMEX>, the course has stupendous views from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> to the sea below as its backdrop. The only drawback is
        the weather, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santo da Serra</ENAMEX> has a wet micro-climate and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fair</ENAMEX>-weather <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">golf</ENAMEX> is relatively limited outside of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. Green fees
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX> esc. for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> holes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> esc. for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> holes, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14,000 esc</NUMEX>.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Tennis</ENAMEX>. Flat land is at such a premium in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX> that even

        Swimming. Although much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madeira‚Äôs</ENAMEX> coast drops dizzily

        a number of pebbly bays and beaches. Sadly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and only
        (black) sandy beach, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prainha</ENAMEX>, is isolated and not very attractive.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHILDREN‚</ENAMEX>ÄôS MADEIRA
        While there are no purpose-built attractions aimed at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, and no real beaches on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> should find the
        island an enjoyable experience, especially if your visit coincides with
        any of the major festivals (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calendar</ENAMEX> of Events, below).
        A number of sightseeing attractions should also appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, as
        should <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs outdoor activities and scenic beauty. And when all
        else fails, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> (at most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>; see ‚ÄúSwimming,‚Äù page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>) are
        enough to satisfy almost any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.
        Among attractions, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardim Bot√¢nico</ENAMEX> (Botanic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden</ENAMEX>), with its bird <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, and the gardens at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Palheiro</ENAMEX>
        Ferreiro are good targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on the hill of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX> makes
        a good <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX>, while the ride down in a wicker toboggan is straight
        out of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX> theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> (though surely tame for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>). The
        cost to ride the toboggans at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carros</ENAMEX> do‚ÄàMonte is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,800 esc</NUMEX>. per

        Activities for slightly older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> include horseback

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, dipping toes into the refreshing irrigation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>,
        cooling off in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>, having a picnic on a hillside‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcan be had at
        any of the levada paths highlighted in this book. The festivals with
        greatest appeal for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Flower Festival</ENAMEX>, with its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">childrens‚Äô parade and ‚ÄúWall of Hope,‚Äù and Carnaval</ENAMEX>.
