        Tucked away in the northwest corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">240‚ÄÇkm</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District</ENAMEX> nestles just below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish</ENAMEX>
        border and backs up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irish Sea</ENAMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just 2,300 sq km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,710 sq</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>), the area is small enough that it can be covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, north
        to south, in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just a few hours</TIMEX>. This little corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> is such a
        beautiful and valued region, however, that policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservationists</ENAMEX> have worked tirelessly over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last hundred years</TIMEX> to
        protect it. The label the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúLake District‚</ENAMEX>Äù is actually a little
        misleading. Although there are in fact many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, much of
        the charm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> lies in the landscapes produced by the high
        peaks, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">majestic valleys</ENAMEX>, swathes of forest, and rugged fells (highland
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plateaus</ENAMEX> or pastures) that surround the lakes. It is an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
        landscape that has enchanted many, from hardworking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sheepherders</ENAMEX> to vacationing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naturalists</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident poets</ENAMEX>. The area‚Äôs
        natural beauty continues to inspire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> come
        not only to view the mountains and the lakes but also to hear the words
        of poets who lived here and to learn about their lives.
        After considerable study and touring in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainer Bramer</ENAMEX> declared that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> had the best
        views in the world. He asserted that the area was blessed with the
        highest concentration of exactly those natural features that, when
        combined, create the most pleasing and relaxing vistas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">possible‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇlandscapes</ENAMEX> composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúlakes</ENAMEX> representing the source of
        life in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> offering the promise of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX>, smooth areas
        providing easy walking and a curved shoreline or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> in the distance
        to stimulate curiosity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Native Lakelanders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> alike know
        exactly what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bramer</ENAMEX> was talking about.
        For such a small tract of land, the geology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        District is actually very complex. The oldest rocks are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">million-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slates</ENAMEX> found around the northern peak of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skiddaw</ENAMEX>,
        where the mountains have smooth and rounded profiles. Only a little
        farther south, around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Langdale Pikes</ENAMEX>, for example, the terrain is
        formed of volcanic rock; much younger and more dramatic in appearance,
        these mountains have rough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">crags</ENAMEX> and sharper peaks. At the southern
        extremities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Park</ENAMEX> are areas of limestone with so-called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúclint</ENAMEX> and grike‚Äù patterns, caused when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> erodes weaker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fissures</ENAMEX>, leaving high narrow ridges or overhangs of stronger rock.
        Ancient glaciers eroded many of the valleys, creating space for the
        lakes as they melted at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the last Ice Age</TIMEX>, approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">b.c.</ENAMEX> Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> wind and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are still hard at work, gradually
        but continually changing the landscape.
        These various types of geological formations and activities
        have created a multitude of environments. There are bare volcanic crags
        soaring from deep valley bottoms, spectacular waterfalls, high
        plateaus, and ridged fells with bracken (thickets of ferns and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>)
        and heather. Throughout the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>, high ground breaks up areas
        of rolling meadows and verdant pasture. Deep valleys with babbling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brooks</ENAMEX> and wooded copses give shelter to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakeland</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Today, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of kilometers</NUMEX> of public footpaths and
        bridle ways extend to almost every valley and reach to every peak,
        offering new delights at every turn in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District</ENAMEX> is rich in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mineral deposits</ENAMEX> that have been
        put to good use since ancient times, and throughout much of the
        region‚Äôs history, mining was a major industry. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">iron-ore mine</ENAMEX> at
        Millom, on the coast southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broughton</ENAMEX>-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Furness</ENAMEX>, was once one of
        the biggest in the world. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farming</ENAMEX> has been another mainstay of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        District economy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. To provide grazing land for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX>,
        which were raised for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX>, large tracts of the forest
        that originally blanketed the whole area were cleared. Today, the sheep
        on the hillsides and in the vales define the region as much as do the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fells</ENAMEX> and the lakes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> give a sense of proportion to the vast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">openness</ENAMEX>, just as the scattered farmhouses and characteristic drystone
        walls add reassuring warmth to even the loneliest valley. This is not
        an artificial landscape supported solely by tourism; today‚Äôs working
        farms help keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District</ENAMEX> vital and distinctive.
        Throughout history, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> of this region carried on
        life in relative isolation from the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The steep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fells</ENAMEX> protected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> but also made transportation of any kind
        difficult; many of today‚Äôs footpaths follow ancient pack-horse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX>,
        which for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> were the principal method of transport. Even today
        it is easy to see why major roads bypass the area; the only routes that
        traverse the region are smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> that twist and turn along the
        river dales and up through the craggy mountain passes. For many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX>,
        a trip to the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">market town</ENAMEX> would have been the farthest they
        would travel in a lifetime.
        Not surprisingly, this self-contained region engendered a
        stalwart sense of self-reliance and independence in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>.
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> live together for generations in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley</ENAMEX>, especially when these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have been forced to pull
        together in times of hardship, a strong feeling of community is
        created, as has been the case throughout the history of this rugged
        territory. The traditional celebrations of rural life and the village
        sports days still give all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> the chance to
        put their skills to the test and to enjoy each other‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>.
        Favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> District competitions range from wrestling and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep dog</ENAMEX>
        trials to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> making.
        Life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakes</ENAMEX> is still organized by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> and the
        activities of lambing, shearing, taking goods to market, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overwintering</ENAMEX> (the local farmers‚Äô term for ‚Äúsurviving the winter‚Äù).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seasons</ENAMEX> of plenty alternate with leaner periods when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> prepare
        to ‚Äúmend and make do. ‚Äù Even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, when agricultural policies provide
        significant aid and resources, farming is still a tough life. There‚Äôs
        little time for recreation in this sometimes harsh environment, and
        though local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> may come across as pragmatic and single-minded,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find them in a more relaxed mood at the end of a hard day‚Äôs
        work, enjoying a pint of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and game of dominoes at the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pub</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> you see standing over his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook</ENAMEX> at the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> may
        not give you a wide smile of welcome, but that short nod of his head
        and tip of his cap is equivalent to a heartfelt hug or handshake in
        other places.
        Much of the farmland and many of the peaks and lakes are
        protected. This happened in response to attempts on the part of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">industrialists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> to exploit the area‚Äôs
        natural resources. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> plan in particular‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa proposal to send a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">railway</ENAMEX> line through the heart of the region‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgalvanized a small group
        of influential local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Wordsworth</ENAMEX>, into
        action. They succeeded in stopping the rail line at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windermere</ENAMEX>. Since
        its founding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1895</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Trust</ENAMEX> has preserved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 100</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">farmhouses</ENAMEX> and the surrounding land as well as many other historic
        structures throughout the region. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District National</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park</ENAMEX> was created, which extended this protection to a much wider area
        while imposing planning regulations and environmental guidelines and
        allowing further public access to the land.
        Reacting in part to the effects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial</ENAMEX>
        Revolution, a group of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>, known collectively as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúLake Poets,‚Äù</ENAMEX> did much to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England‚Äôs</ENAMEX> national consciousness about
        the landscape and natural beauties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District</ENAMEX>. City <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dwellers</ENAMEX>
        from northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> began to spend their free time here, walking on
        the fells or enjoying boat trips on the lakes. Their numbers have grown
        steadily ever since, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> come to enjoy
        the countryside and to visit the sites first made famous by Romantic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourism</ENAMEX> is now the biggest industry in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> have proliferated, extending a warm
        welcome and the best of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakeland</ENAMEX> hospitality to ever-growing numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
        This popularity is also a source of considerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> to
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District</ENAMEX>. Traffic jams, overflowing car
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parks</ENAMEX>, and eroded footpaths are all difficulties that need to be
        addressed. The challenge is how to stop the landscape from being
        changed by the very <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who come to marvel at it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Trust</ENAMEX>
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Park Authority</ENAMEX> both work on conservation projects and
        these, along with innovative transportation policies devised by local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">councils</ENAMEX>, are all designed to help minimize the potential negative
        impact of tourism.
        Aside from these difficulties, which are suffered by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Parks</ENAMEX> all over the world, there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other matter that can‚Äôt
        be overlooked: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>. It rains regularly, whatever <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>, so be
        prepared to experience some inclement weather during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your</TIMEX> visit. The
        rain irrigates the forests and fills the streams, waterfalls, and
        rivers that feed the lakes, so without it, of course, the magnificent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landscapes</ENAMEX> would be altered forever. Fortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Lake</ENAMEX> District
        retains its beauty in all types of weather, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all seasons</TIMEX>. Spring
        offers the fresh green of grasses in the valley and bracken on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hills</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Woodland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> are blanketed with swathes of bluebells, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gowbarrow Park</ENAMEX>, immortalized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wordsworth</ENAMEX>, has its ‚Äúhost of golden
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">daffodils</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lambing time</TIMEX>, the frolicking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> are enchanting.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Summer</ENAMEX> boasts long, warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> with strong sunlight and hazy views.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butterflies</ENAMEX> play among the blooms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as day</TIMEX>-trippers enjoy a picnic or a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lakeside</ENAMEX> walk. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Autumn</ENAMEX> brings the finest hues to the landscape, when the
        leaves turn shades of apricot and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX>, the bracken changes to a
        burnt umber, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hillsides</ENAMEX> glow in the low sunlight, reflecting
        perfectly in the glassy stillness of the lakes. After the first
        snowfall of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, the fell tops turn white, complementing the walls
        of the rugged farmhouses and the gentle plumes of smoke that rise from
        log fires into the crisp cold air.
        Recognized by a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> as a very precious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake District</ENAMEX> has been praised in prose and verse and
        protected by wise policies so that the rest of the world can come and
        enjoy its particular beauty. No one who comes here can fail to be awed
        by the landscape and charmed by the lifestyle of this small yet
        spectacular corner of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>.
