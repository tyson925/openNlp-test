        Madeira‚Äôs small size can be deceiving. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 57 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) long by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 miles</NUMEX>) wide, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance might indicate that
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> would be sufficient to see the whole place. Even in a rental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs steep, moun¬≠tainous terrain and winding, two-lane roads
        make that very difficult. The coastal route is beautiful, but
        potentially nerve-wracking; only the southern section from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Cani√ßo</NUMEX> west
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeira Brava</ENAMEX> is served by the excellent highway (via r√°pida) cut
        through the mountains.
        A minimum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> is necessary to see a good portion
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>; a week allows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> to do it justice and take the
        time to enjoy its scenic outdoors at a relaxed pace. Until recently,
        most visitors‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcounseled not to attempt to drive the island‚Äôs
        difficult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">roads‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhopped</ENAMEX> aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> daytrips that took in the main
        attractions. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Roads</ENAMEX> are improving, though, and while driving isn‚Äôt
        necessarily the horror it once was, traveling by rental car should be
        reserved for confident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> comfortable on steep, winding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terrain</ENAMEX>.
        More and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are choosing to stay outside of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>; the offer of mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lodges</ENAMEX> and smaller coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> has
        greatly improved over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, and there are now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> who barely
        set foot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
        Funchal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> is the single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of any size on the island, indeed
        in the whole of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">archipelago</ENAMEX>. Most historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, and
        traditional sights are located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. With a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120,000</NUMEX>, it is a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> than most expect to find on such a tiny
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>, but in fact you can walk across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just 10 to 15</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. Exploring inland to the north is difficult on foot, however:
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> become very steep.
        Nevertheless, walking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">re¬</ENAMEX>≠mains the only practical way to see
        Funchal: The narrow, cobbled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> were never meant for motor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vehicles</ENAMEX>, and they can be surprisingly congested with traffic.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to get your bearings upon arrival is to walk out on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ilh√©u de Pontinha</ENAMEX> and view <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> as those
        aboard cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> do. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1962</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pontinha</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> its way
        straight through the middle of the old fortress, which until then was
        perched on top of a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Looe Rock</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Funchal‚Äôs</NUMEX> deep natural harbor propelled the city‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th and 16th centuries</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma¬≠dei¬≠ra</ENAMEX> became known
        to expeditions on their way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>. With the
        exception of ocean liners and picturesque fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, Funchal
        remains a working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> (handling containerized freight) and home to a
        small oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX>.
        The view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from the harbor is outstanding: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squat</ENAMEX>
        white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with red terracotta roofs climb steeply through tropical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">greenery</ENAMEX> all around the spacious bay.
        Madeira‚Äôs rugged mountains form an attractive backdrop to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Just north is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX>, and tucked into the hills
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX> and east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the city‚Äôs best gardens, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardim Bot√¢nico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Palheiro</ENAMEX>. The newest hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> is due
        west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> along the coast, stretching for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) or so
        before the coast bends on the way to the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¢mara de Lobos</ENAMEX>,
        and the high cliff, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabo Gir√£o.</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center of Town</ENAMEX>
        The dominant building on the seafront is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pal√°cio de S√</ENAMEX>£o
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louren√ßo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortress of St. Lawrence</ENAMEX>). Erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, it
        guarded the bay against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pirate ships‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou</ENAMEX> can still see the ancient
        cannons poking through the crenellated walls. White-gloved sentries
        guard the main gate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX>. Although the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is not open to the
        public, the official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> may be
        visited by prearranged, guided tours (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">291/20 25 30</NUMEX>).
        At the intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenida Zarco</ENAMEX> and the main drag,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Arriaga</ENAMEX>, stands a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs discoverer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√</ENAMEX>£o
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gon√ßalves Zarco‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇoften</ENAMEX> referred to as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúFirst Captain</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imposing Pal√°cio do Governo Re¬≠gio¬≠nal</ENAMEX>, a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with tiled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patios</ENAMEX> and the administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>, rises behind the
        Zarco monument to the right.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Av</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arriaga</ENAMEX> is particularly pretty during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late spring</TIMEX>, when
        jacaranda <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are in full blossom. Along here you will find the
        tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and, just next door, at no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>, the Adegas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de S√£o Francisco</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Blandy Wine Lodge</ENAMEX>), the oldest working wine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lodge</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX>. The atmospheric place was part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monastery</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fortified wines
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aren‚Äôt</ENAMEX> made here any longer, you can take a tour of the lodge (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mon‚ÄìFri</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30 am and 3:30pm</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sat 11am</ENAMEX>) and the wine cellars. A tour isn‚Äôt
        necessary to visit (and have a taste or make a purchase) at the
        handsome vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar</ENAMEX> and tasting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
        A few steps west of the lodge is the small but lush Parque
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Cidade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Park</ENAMEX>), a delightful urban green space. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Exotic trees</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are mingled with statuary, and black swans glide across a small
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pond</ENAMEX>. Across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teatro Municipal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Municipal Theater</ENAMEX>),
        a miniature Victorian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gem</ENAMEX> that hosts periodic concerts, while opposite
        the wine lodge is an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish kirk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>), another indicator of
        the strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> influence on the island‚Äôs development.
        Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the incongruous but elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automobile Showroom</ENAMEX>, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> and worth noting for
        its fine blue-and-white azulejo (tile) vignettes that depict scenes
        from old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>.
        Toward the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Av</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arriaga</ENAMEX> (at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua Jo√£o Tavira</ENAMEX>) is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√©</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>).
        Begun <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at the end of the 15th century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚Äôs S√</ENAMEX>© is one of the city‚Äôs
        only surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> of colonization. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exterior</ENAMEX> is adorned with a brick clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, but the cathedral‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> is considerably more impressive. It has Gothic arches, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">splendid inlaid cedar</ENAMEX> ceiling of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> design, beautifully carved
        blue-and-gold <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">choir stalls</ENAMEX>, gilded altars, and a sprinkling of nice
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">azulejos</ENAMEX> (blue-and-white ceramic tiles).
        A walk along <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Aljube</ENAMEX> takes you to some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        pedestrian shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Tucked behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rua Jo√£o Tavira</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carreira</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pra√ßa do Munic√≠pio</ENAMEX>, the town‚Äôs dignified main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, with
        a mosaic of black-and-white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> and pretty white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        sides. To the left is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja do Col√©gio</ENAMEX> (Collegiate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>), originally founded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1574</TIMEX>. A spacious and airy
        old place, it‚Äôs decorated with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th- and 18th-century</TIMEX> tiles, paintings,
        and gilt-wood carving. The adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> served as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barracks</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>.
        Straight ahead on the square stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¢mara Municipal</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town Hall</ENAMEX>), which occupies a former <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Don‚Äôt miss
        the graceful, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leda and the Swan</ENAMEX> in the inner
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX>. The statue used to be in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish market‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇa fact
        corroborated by the tile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> outside the present municipal market
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>).
        On the square‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> (south) side is the very interesting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu de Arte Sacra</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Sacred Art</ENAMEX>), housed in what was a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop of Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>. The
        outstanding works on view include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen or so</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th- and 16th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> paintings, regarded as some of the richest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> and rare
        even in the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. These vibrant masterpieces, as well as
        other excellent works from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of the same period,
        belonged to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX>, who during the 16th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> traded their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúwhite gold‚Äù</ENAMEX> for principal art treasures of the
        day.
        The back door of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua do Bispo</ENAMEX> (Street
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop</ENAMEX>), and both this and the parallel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua Queimada</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cima</ENAMEX>, are worth exploring. Then continue west from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do
        Municipio on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Carreira</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> full of interesting,
        old-fashioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>. It is particularly noteworthy for
        the cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that cater primarily to city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>, but also
        satisfy a good number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few yards</NUMEX> left is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museu Vicente de Fotografia</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vicente Photography Museum</ENAMEX>). It is easy to miss, but once you have
        spotted it, cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and look back at the faded, ancient sign
        and the colonnades on the wall above. The narrow entrance squeezes past
        a bookshop and opens out into a delightful, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-filled patio. This
        was the first public photo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX> opened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> (during the
        1850s), and some of the props on display are amusingly quaint. In
        addition to the varied selection of memorabilia and antique
        photographic equipment, don‚Äôt miss having a flick through the albums of
        photographs of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1884</TIMEX>.
        Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of hundred yards</NUMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S√£o Francisco</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> rise sharply. Off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Carreira</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cal√ßada Santa</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clara</ENAMEX>, a picturesque, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> full of interest. At the junction
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua Mouraria</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu Municipal do Funchal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Municipal Museum</ENAMEX>),
        yet another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> aristocratic home converted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        (entrance on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua Mouraria</ENAMEX>). On the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floor</ENAMEX> is a modest aquarium
        showing the sealife of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>, while upstairs is a thoroughly
        old-fashioned collection of stuffed local sea and land creatures. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> is probably best for younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        Returning to the hill, on the opposite side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        is the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja de S√£o</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX>, an unusual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. Its walls are
        lined entirely with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blue-and-white</ENAMEX> checked-pattern azulejos and it has
        a beautifully painted wood ceiling, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> chandeliers, and a massively
        gilded altar and side chapels.
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few yards</NUMEX> farther up the hill is the recently restored
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa Museu Frederico de Freitas</ENAMEX>. The private collection includes
        paintings of old Madeira by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">apartments</ENAMEX> of a well-to-do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeiran</ENAMEX> household.
        Continue uphill to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Convento de Santa Clara</ENAMEX>. Built
        toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 15th century</TIMEX> and expanded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two centuries later</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> run by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> nuns. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">convent church</ENAMEX> is a
        splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, with walls completely covered by rare, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">azulejos</ENAMEX> in geometric patterns, and with a fine painted ceiling.
        Madeira‚Äôs discoverer, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zarco</ENAMEX>, is buried beneath the altar, but the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">memorial</ENAMEX> to him vanished long ago. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> at the back of the church
        is not Zarco‚Äôs, but that of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
        During his stint as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> of the island, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zarco</ENAMEX> is
        believed to have lived a short distance up Cal√ßada do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico</ENAMEX>, in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinta das Cruzes</ENAMEX>. Originally constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, but
        rebuilt after an earthquake in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1748</TIMEX> and expanded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>,
        this is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quinta</ENAMEX> (estate villa) open to the public. The
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antiques</ENAMEX>, including furniture from a
        variety of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> and origins. There are superb <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX>
        Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeiran</ENAMEX> as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18th</NUMEX>- and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> pieces.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is surrounded by a lovely, somewhat unkempt
        garden of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (including a good orchid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX>). However, the outstanding feature is the ‚Äúarchaeological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garden</ENAMEX>,‚Äù an outdoor display of relics from some of the oldest places on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">island‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtombstones</ENAMEX>, pieces taken from important <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        splendid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early-16th-century</TIMEX> stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manueline</ENAMEX> windows (pick up the
        Quinta‚Äôs own leaflet for information on these).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> separating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinta das Cruzes</ENAMEX> from the Convento
        leads to a lookout point with a view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dome of the English Church</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Market, Old Town</ENAMEX>, and Seafront
        Between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">streams‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇribeiras</ENAMEX> (riverbeds) that carry
        excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> down from the mountains to the sea‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis</ENAMEX> Rua <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fern√</ENAMEX>£o
        Ornelas, a street lined with old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> that leads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs certral
        market. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, the little rivers are hidden beneath trellises of
        blazing bougainvillea.
        Directly ahead lies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavradores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Workers‚</ENAMEX>Äô
        Market), housed in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story, open-roofed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX>.
        The market is open from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>
        until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX>; the best time to visit is on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> or
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX> from all over the island
        pour into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. This is the only time when the central part is filled
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX>.
        The market is bustling, fragrant, and colorful, with exotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fruits</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> of all shapes, colors, and sizes. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Meat</ENAMEX>
        stalls can be found around the outside, as well as several wicker and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handicraft</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. You will also find an open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, vegetable, and
        clothes market just behind the main market, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park area</ENAMEX> next to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> stops.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercado dos Lavradores</ENAMEX> is the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Town</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> (even though you will not see signs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zona Velha</ENAMEX> until
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">farther east</ENAMEX>). The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are the narrow, cobbled alleyway of Rua
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Santa Maria</ENAMEX> and, parallel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua Dom Carlos I.</ENAMEX> This east end of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> is the antithesis of the opulent hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> to the west: It is
        poor and decaying, but filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.
        The only visible gentrification is the row of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
        that you reach at the pedestrian-only stretch leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Capela</ENAMEX> do
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corpo Santo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Chapel of the Body of Christ</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>, dating to the
        end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>, is the oldest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>. Although a few
        artisan‚Äôs workshops are nearby, this old fishermen‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> is mainly
        a residential area.
        Down a narrow alleyway, past <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edwardian</ENAMEX>-style beach huts
        used by local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> for storage and napping in, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forte de S√£o Tiago</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. James Fortress</ENAMEX>). Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> and
        expanded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1700s</TIMEX>, the picturesque fort now houses a modest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu de Arte Con¬≠tem¬≠por√°nea</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Contemporary Art</ENAMEX>). Another
        sign that this part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> is being revitalized is the new lido,
        known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barreirinha</ENAMEX>, on the beach below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja de Santa Maria</ENAMEX>
        Maior, an elegant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> church worth a visit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> of the
        caf√© below has fine views of the sea to the east.
        Along the seafront, just off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua da Alf√¢ndaga</ENAMEX>, is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parlamento Regional</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regional Parliament Building</ENAMEX>). Built in the 16th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX> and formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Customs House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alf√¢ndega Velha</ENAMEX>), the
        oldest parts of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> lie inside the imposing gateway. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX>-paved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby area</ENAMEX> is dominated by an enormous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>-style vase,
        which at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 5 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">171/2 ft</ENAMEX>) tall, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stands</ENAMEX> almost as high as a giraffe.
        Made recently by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Portuguese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>, it is
        listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Guinness Book of Records</ENAMEX> as the world‚Äôs tallest ceramic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vase</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West of Town</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida Arriaga</ENAMEX> ends at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pra√</ENAMEX>ßa do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Infante</ENAMEX>, where a
        statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry the Navigator</ENAMEX> (a copy of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lagos</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algarve</ENAMEX>) sits at the easternmost tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parque Santa Catarina</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Park</ENAMEX>). A delightful hilltop retreat, it has splendid views
        over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina</ENAMEX> to the bay beyond. Aside from the gardens, lake, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">playground</ENAMEX>, other points of interest include a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> (who may have lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX> for a while), and, close by,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Catarina</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>. At the west
        end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, the elegant pink <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta Vigia</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>. The well-tended gardens are open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, as
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX>.
        Above the park looms the startling sight of the Pestana
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carlton Park Hotel</ENAMEX> (designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Niemeyer</ENAMEX>, famous for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">futuristic Brasilia</ENAMEX>). The giant box of a hotel signals the start of the
        traditional hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>, flush with well-known, deluxe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>
        such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeira Carlton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reid‚Äôs</ENAMEX>, plus a few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-star
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>, quintas, and posh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>.
        Just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avenida do Infante</ENAMEX> (along <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua Dr. Pita</ENAMEX>) is
        the delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinta</ENAMEX> Magn√≥lia park. Here you can swim or play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>, have a walk around the gardens, and round off the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> on the patio.
        Beginning west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reid‚Äôs Hote l</ENAMEX> is the newest hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>,
        known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zona Turista</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Zone</ENAMEX>). The enclave, which in its
        entirety exists to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and serve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, is perennially stocked with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cranes</ENAMEX>, as new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> continue to be erected.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glorious Gardens</ENAMEX>
        A short bus or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> ride into the steep hillsides northeast
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> (on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camacha</ENAMEX>) leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardim Bot√</ENAMEX>¢nico
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Botanical Garden</ENAMEX>), the island‚Äôs most comprehensive public garden.
        Inaugurated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</TIMEX>, the gardens have examples of virtually every plant
        that grows on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> and lots of subtropical <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> from
        places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>. It occupies steep terraces that
        offer fine views over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>. The adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parque do Loiro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropical</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird Park</ENAMEX>) has been incorporated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Botanic Garden</ENAMEX>. In open areas
        and cages, it has all manner ofbirds, parrots, and peacocks.
        Just a short walk down the hill is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardim Orqu√</ENAMEX>≠dea
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pregetter‚Äôs Orchid Garden</ENAMEX>). A relatively new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">project</ENAMEX> in orchid
        breeding, it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4,000</NUMEX> varieties of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">delicate orchids</ENAMEX>.
        Another of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal‚</ENAMEX>Äôs loveliest gardens, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> away
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta da Boa Vista</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rua Luis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Figueiroa de Albuquerque</ENAMEX>). The
        lovely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200-year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and garden are flush with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX>. The
        cymbidiums have received many awards, most notably from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Horticultural Society</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Orchids</ENAMEX> are also on sale here, and you
        will never find them any fresher. The grounds include an ancient wine
        press and a charming thatched cottage.
        The most splendid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs horticultural wonders,
        however, are the gardens at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Palheiro Ferreiro</ENAMEX> (formerly
        called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blandy Gardens</ENAMEX>). The hillside estate, only a short bus ride
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>, is the property of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reid‚Äôs Hotel</ENAMEX> and
        is one of the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">producers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Madeira wine</ENAMEX>. The original quinta and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel of the Count of Carvalhal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta do Palheiro</ENAMEX> has been in the
        hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blandy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a century</TIMEX>. (The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is
        closed to the public. )
        The gardens, designed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
        and established over several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX>, are most famous for their
        camellias, though the diversity of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, including a lush
        array of tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, is quite remarkable. The long, cobbled
        entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> is shaded by plane <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, while the fields which lie on
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> are carpeted with a wonderful spread of agapanthus and arum,
        and belladonna lilies in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>.
        Formal and informal areas are landscaped with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fountains</ENAMEX>, while terraces tumble down the hillsides. A deep, wild
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ravine</ENAMEX> with thick tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetation</ENAMEX> is nicknamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúRiver of Hell</ENAMEX>.
        ‚Äù Yet the garden retains the distinctive charming and peaceful
        atmosphere of the timeless grounds of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.
        Around Funchal
        A number of excellent visits are within easy reach of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>. Tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> often promote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico dos Barcelos</ENAMEX>, and
        Curral das <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freiras</ENAMEX> as a popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">half-day</TIMEX> excursion.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte</ENAMEX> has been a fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> town ever since
        wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and exiled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> aristocrats in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>
        built their splendid quintas up here in the cool air above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it‚Äôs perhaps best known for the anachronistic toboggan rides that
        originate here. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX> pleasantly evokes yesteryear.
        The rack-and-pinion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> that once labored up the ferociously steep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX> closed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX> is still here, its
        arches visible over the perfectly clipped public gardens <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jardim</ENAMEX> do
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte</ENAMEX> (established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX>). In fact, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930</TIMEX>, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 years</TIMEX> of service,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> exploded, killing a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. By the advent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte‚</ENAMEX>Äôs golden age was over.
        A short walk along a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the elegant
        and richly decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Monte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte</ENAMEX>), dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 August</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> make the annual pilgrimage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. A chapel on the left
        holds the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of the last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austro-Hungarian</ENAMEX> emperors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles I</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hungary</ENAMEX>), who died on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>. At the
        bottom of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is the starting point for the island‚Äôs best-known
        attraction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Carrinhos de Monte‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> unique roller-coaster ride
        down the hill aboard a wicker toboggan (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jardim do Pal√</ENAMEX>°cio do <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Palace Tropical</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardens</ENAMEX>), a short walk east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, is firmly rooted in the
        past. The gardens that surround the ch√¢teau-like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Palace‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇonce
        the area‚Äôs most fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hotels‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare home</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and
        various other displays. The entrance fee is quite high by Madeiran
        standards (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,500</NUMEX> esc. ), but within the gates is an impressive
        collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native</ENAMEX> and exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX> (especially good <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cycads</ENAMEX>), a koi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pond</ENAMEX>, porcelain collection, and historical artifacts from throughout
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX>, including architectural pieces taken from important buildings
        and prized azulejo panels. The unimpeded views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unbeatable</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terreiro da Luta</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">876 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,873 ft</NUMEX>), has its base about

        the top and offers yet another magnificent panorama of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>. It was
        here that the revered figure of Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte</ENAMEX> (now in the church
        below) was allegedly discovered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>.
        On the summit is a monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora da Paz</ENAMEX> (Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lady of Peace</ENAMEX>), dedicated to the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Around</ENAMEX> the
        monument are anchor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> sunk in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">harbor</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> torpedoes.
        Equally stunning views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> and surroundings can be
        enjoyed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pico dos Barcelos</ENAMEX>. Although at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">355 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,164 ft</NUMEX>) the altitude
        of the balcony is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terreiro da Luta</ENAMEX>, the sweeping
        views from west to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> and back into the terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hillsides</ENAMEX> are
        superb. If you have brought your own transport, make a short detour to
        see the handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">landmark church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Martinho</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs surprising to
        find such a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in a relatively isolated farming parish.
        Another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) north on the narrow, twisting road
        is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curral das Freiras</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> that until very recently was truly
        isolated from the outside world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">‚ÄúRefuge of the Nuns‚</ENAMEX>Äù is a perfect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crater</ENAMEX> surrounded by extinct volcanoes. The nuns in question fled here
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara Convent</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> to escape raiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>.
        Protected on all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sides‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhidden</ENAMEX> is more accurate‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇby inaccessible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mountains</ENAMEX>, and supported by rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volcanic</ENAMEX> soil and abundant sunshine,
        their settlement became permanent.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> became famous for its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherries</ENAMEX> and chestnuts,
        and the popular liqueurs ginja and licor de castanha. The cakes here
        are also excellent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> continued in splendid isolation until
        quite recently, when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX> were finally bored through the mountains
        to bring the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. Fitting for a place once cut off from the
        secular world, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> had to wait until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> before the first
        television pictures arrived.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curral das Freiras</ENAMEX> is pleasant enough, but the quiet
        village is perhaps best experienced from above. The view peering down
        into the valley from the lookout point of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eira do Serrado</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,006</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m/3</ENAMEX>,300 ft) is breathtaking. The whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and red-tile roofs
        scatter about a sun-dappled, green terraced valley. If you opt for a
        coach tour, make sure a stop at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eira do Serrado</ENAMEX> is included (there‚Äôs
        also great shopping and a newly built estalagem, or inn, here).
        An alternative view is from the south, way across the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley</ENAMEX>, at the lookout point with the romantic name of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boca</ENAMEX> dos
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Namorados</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lovers‚Äô Nest</ENAMEX>). This is a difficult trek that, although
        feasible by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, is usually incorporated on the itinerary of jeep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">safaris</ENAMEX>. From here, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panorama</ENAMEX> sweeps round and takes in the entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley</ENAMEX> (though even at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3,608 m/1,100 ft you‚Äôll</NUMEX> still be close enough to
        hear the bell of the village <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine</ENAMEX> scenery looks as if it
        is straight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>.
        Camacha, back toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX> and east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, is a
        pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> set at a refreshing altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,300 ft</NUMEX>).
        In the heart of willow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camacha</ENAMEX> is famous throughout the island
        as the heart of the wickerwork industry. Around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the
        region are employed crafting wicker furniture, hats, trays, decorative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, and about anything you can imagine in wicker. Around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Camacha</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">north</ENAMEX> of here you‚Äôll likely see the stripped willow soaked and left to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dry</ENAMEX>, either by a river <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>, propped up against a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, or in wigwam
        fashion in the fields. You may even see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> sitting at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">roadside</ENAMEX>, cooking the willow in cauldron-like vats and laboriously
        stripping off the bark.
        Most of the weaving is done in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, however, and the
        only place you are guaranteed to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> at work is in the
        slightly dingy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√© Rel√≥gio</ENAMEX>. Despite its rather dull
        appearance and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, this <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-story
        ‚Äúwicker-superstore‚Äù is an excellent place for shopping and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">refreshments‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> just about the only highlight in town. The upstairs
        restaurant features <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeiran</ENAMEX> food and has excellent panoramic
        views.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camacha</ENAMEX> is also the starting point for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> excellent levada
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">walks</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>), suitable for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of all ages and abilities. One
        heads west to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vale do Para√≠so</ENAMEX>, the other northeast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eira de Fora</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> Madeira
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Madeira</ENAMEX> begins just beyond the capital‚Äôs tourist
        zone. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C√¢mara de Lobos (‚</ENAMEX>Äúlair of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea-wolves‚Äù</ENAMEX>). The peculiar name refers to the seals that once swam near
        the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C√¢mara de Lobos</ENAMEX> is more picturesque from afar than it is up
        close. It owes its reputation to its youthful, moreso than present,
        beauty. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX> spent time on the island painting
        the fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, an interest that ensured its standing as an idyllic,
        old-world fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. The gaily-painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> are still here, as
        is the protected, rocky natural harbor, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old quarter</TIMEX> overlooking
        the ocean has seen better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port area</ENAMEX> has resisted attempts at gentrification and
        fairly swaggers with macho atmosphere. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hard-drinking locals</ENAMEX> down poncha
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar-cane brandy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon juice</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX>) in shadowy bars, while
        grizzled old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> play cards or repair their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>, awaiting their
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next</TIMEX> trip. Close to the waterfront is a small, white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chapel</ENAMEX>, an early
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> project that was later rebuilt (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1723</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">winery</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henriques & Henriques</ENAMEX> is also in town. Otherwise, there‚Äôs not much
        for the tourist here, but you have to hand it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¢mara de Lobos</ENAMEX> for
        remaining a pure and simple working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>.
        Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√¢mara de Lobos</ENAMEX>, the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> climbs for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>), passing through some of the richest agricultural country
        in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX>, famous for the high quality of its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX>.
        Eventually it leads to the top of the mighty headland known as Cabo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gir√£o.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the highest sea cliffs in the world, it plummets <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">590 m</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,900 ft</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. The views east and west along the coast are
        sensational. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue-and-white</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agapanthus</ENAMEX> cling to the top of the
        promontory, and pine and eucalyptus creep right to the edge, but an
        even greater degree of daring can be seen <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of feet</NUMEX> below, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> have managed to salvage tiny plots of arable land, terracing
        them into little green postage stamps stuck onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and base of
        the cliff.
        The winding road continues on through the sprawling
        settlements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinta Grande</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campan√°rio.</ENAMEX> The latter, an important
        grape-growing area, is also remarkable for its cliff-side caves, used
        by local fisherman for storage purposes. A local boat trip is required
        to see them.
        The next major settlement, heading westwards, is Ribeira
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brava</ENAMEX> (if in a hurry, it can be reached in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 15 minutes</TIMEX> on the via
        r√°pida <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>). The town‚Äôs name, which means ‚Äúwild river‚Äù
        or ‚Äúravine,‚Äù seems hyperbolic for such an orderly and peaceful little
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>. Except in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeira Brava‚</ENAMEX>Äôs river is more of a tame
        trickle. The river <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> due north, as does the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇstraight</ENAMEX> across
        the island to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">S√£o Vicente‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇmaking the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of Ribeira Brava
        (established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1440</TIMEX>) an important junction. There are a couple of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> here and a pleasant stony beach with umbrellas.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> blocks back from the beach, the main focus of
        attention is a tidy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, paved with black, egg-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> from
        the beach, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, with a blue-and-white tiled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">steeple</ENAMEX>. Next door is the small municipal market, while behind is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, featuring an attractive old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeira Brava</ENAMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> excursions <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> north to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√</ENAMEX>£o
        Vicente, as the road cuts through some of the best scenery on the whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>. However, those with more time can continue along the southwest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponta do Sol</ENAMEX> is the next <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeira Brava</ENAMEX>. As
        its name suggests, it is blessed with more than its fair share of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sunshine</ENAMEX>. Only during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> does it really come alive, however,
        when beach umbrellas are set out on the pebbly shore across from the
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of note here: an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art-Deco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX>. As is frequently the case in Madeiran
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, the best views are from vantage points on the hillside road
        as it climbs up away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>.
        Past the tiny settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canhas</ENAMEX>, notable for its statue
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Teresa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stations of the Cross</ENAMEX>, is a miradouro
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlooking Madalena do Mar.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponta do Sol</ENAMEX>
        is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calheta</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantation center</ENAMEX> and the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
        significance as you head west. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>, the parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, dates
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1430</TIMEX> but was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1639</TIMEX>: It features a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moorish</ENAMEX>-style
        ceiling. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calheta</ENAMEX> is the site of recent tourism investment, but as of
        yet doesn‚Äôt attract large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX>. From here, the best idea is to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">backtrack</ENAMEX> along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Funchal</ENAMEX>, either heading inland to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pa√∫l da Serra</ENAMEX> or heading a bit farther east on your way toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">√Ågua</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Vicente</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pa√∫l da Serra (‚ÄúHigh Moorland‚Äù</ENAMEX>) comes as a surprise on this
        island with such luxuriant vegetation. A plateau that measures <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11 miles</NUMEX>) long by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3.6 miles</NUMEX>) wide, the flat plain stands in
        dramatic contrast to the rugged mountains in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scenery</ENAMEX> and landscape of the plateau are reminiscent of the bleak moors
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, and on clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> it is possible to see both the north and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south</ENAMEX> coasts of the island. In good weather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> are drawn to its
        remote and barren character. If you are thinking of walking or hiking
        here, be warned that mists descend suddenly; you may want to go with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guide</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</NUMEX>).
        On the road west to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Moniz</ENAMEX>, a minor road leads to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raba√ßal</ENAMEX>, a beautiful valley popular among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Madeirans</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and
        holidays. It is also the starting point for a couple of spectacular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">levada</ENAMEX> walks (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>). One is an easy, flat, and short (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes roundtrip</TIMEX>) trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risco</ENAMEX> waterfall. The other takes about
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> and involves a pretty steep climb along the way to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fontes (‚Äú25 Springs‚Äù)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇas the name suggests, a verdant and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water-filled</ENAMEX> spot. Both walks, indicated on almost all maps of Madeira
        (including the free one given out by the tourism <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>), are
        delightfully scenic.
        At the island‚Äôs extreme northwestern tip is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Moniz</ENAMEX>,
        located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">70 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44 miles</NUMEX>), but seemingly a world away, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>. A
        volcanic extension reaches out into the waves of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, and the
        reefs form a series of protected natural pools. Small plots of land,
        divided by heath-tree fencing (to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX>-laden
        wind) climb the hills overlooking the sea. With few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> other
        than a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>-tour circuit, it
        isn‚Äôt really a place to linger, unless the weather‚Äôs warm and you want
        to go swimming or sit on the rocks and contemplate the ocean.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East</ENAMEX> from here, the coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is one of the island‚Äôs
        star attractions. Often shrouded in mist, the two-lane road hugs the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">jagged</ENAMEX> coast and climbs the mountainside, clinging precariously to a
        narrow ledge. A rocky outcrop with a hole carved in it like an open
        window has lent itself to the name of the nearest settlement, Ribeira
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Janela (‚ÄúRiver Window‚Äù</ENAMEX>). Water gushes down from the mountains; some
        is diverted to hydro-electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, but a lot simply drains off
        into the sea, splashing off passing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> like a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">car wash</ENAMEX> or
        amusement-park ride.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Seixal (‚Äúsay-shall‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is the only other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX> before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Vicente</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sercial</ENAMEX> grape, used to produce the driest style of
        Madeira, is named for this pretty coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> that is the center of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>-growing district. Just beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seixal</ENAMEX>, heading east, it is well
        worth taking a short detour to make the steep climb up to the
        attractive spot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ch√£o da Ribeira</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√£o Vicente</ENAMEX>, perhaps the prettiest village on the island,
        begins at the point where the northern coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> meets the
        north-south road heading <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">21 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13 miles</NUMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeira Brava</ENAMEX>. The town
        lies just south of an unusual little chapel carved out of a rock. S√£o
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vicente‚Äôs</ENAMEX> compact and well-cared-for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is pedestrian-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX>, and
        attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and caf√©s look onto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>, a lovely church
        with a colorful painted ceiling depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourism</ENAMEX> is making inroads, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> have been
        designed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>-trippers in mind, but the village remains pristine.
        Larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and a hotel line the seafront, but the village
        itself is set inland, protected from the harsh ocean winds.
        The newest tourist attraction in these parts is the Grutas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de S√£o Vicente</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Caves</ENAMEX>), opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. Formed when a now
        extinct volcano erupted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 400,000 years ago</TIMEX>, the caves were
        carved by molten lava. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">‚Äútubes‚Äù</ENAMEX> formed are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than a kilometer</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">half mile</NUMEX>) in length. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1855</TIMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Englishman</ENAMEX> discovered the caves,
        which, being a lava bed, do not have icy limestone stalagmites and
        stalactites but ‚Äúlava drops‚Äù that look like thick whirls of chocolate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mousse</ENAMEX>. In a low-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> near the cave entrance is a small
        ethnographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, a place to see displays of local island customs
        and costumes as you wait <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of minutes</TIMEX> for the guided cave tour
        to begin.
        High on a hill above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is an odd
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">church‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇactually</ENAMEX> a clockless clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇstanding</ENAMEX> over a small
        chapel dedicated to Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lady</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F√°tima.</ENAMEX> This isolated spot is a
        significant pilgrimage place, and can be seen for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> around.
        From here, the road continues to cut its way through
        beautiful, verdant countryside until finally coming to a crest at the
        pass of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boca da Encumeada</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">626 m/1,007 ft</NUMEX>). From this point you can see
        right to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast and well into the south, while stretching on
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> are vast expanses of mountain scenery. This is one of the
        starting points for strenuous treks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico Ruivo</ENAMEX> (the island‚Äôs highest
        peak, at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,862 m/6,109 ft</NUMEX>).
        Of a more relaxed nature, one of the island‚Äôs best levada
        walks skirts the edge of the mountain and takes in the entire valley,
        with views of the sea. Look for concrete steps opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caf√</ENAMEX>©
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encumeada</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45-minute</TIMEX> walk along the water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>, more a stroll
        through a botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> than a hike, is lined with hydrangea and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ferns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> at a waterfall. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> about halfway along provides
        chilly relief on a hot day.
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 miles</NUMEX>) south of the pass, perched on the edge
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de √Ågua</ENAMEX>, is a hand¬≠some and comfortable mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">chalet</ENAMEX>, the
        best of its kind on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pousada dos Vinh√°ticos</ENAMEX> (vinh√°tico is a
        type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Madeiran mahogany</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>) enjoys the sort of views that many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine hotels</ENAMEX> would cherish. It‚Äôs the perfect place for lunch or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>, but many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>, especially those with hiking on their
        minds, find it an ideal place to stay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX>.
        The valley on the opposite side of the road, south of the
        pousada, is known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de √Ågua</ENAMEX>, and lays claim to the distinction
        of being the island‚Äôs first hydro-electric power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. In spite of
        the introduction of modern technology, however, the valley remains a
        quiet agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> tucked away in some of the island‚Äôs
        lushest hills.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from here leads down into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeira Brava</ENAMEX>, where the
        via r√°pida motorway whisks you back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚Äôs Mountainous Middle</ENAMEX>
        The rugged mountain range that splits the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> into north
        and south makes weather forecasting a difficult proposition on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>.
        One route to take in a good section of this picturesque terrain is to
        drive north (and up) from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santana</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north</ENAMEX> coast.
        There are beautiful vistas, secluded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, and a range of
        exhilarating walks en route.
        While it is usually warm and clear down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>, the
        mountains are often shrouded in a wintry mist. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily
        mean that you‚Äôll have no view once you start climbing, however. The
        tops of the mountains often jut through the clouds, a spectacular sight
        in itself. Madeira‚Äôs microclimates are very difficult to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>,
        especially from below. If it looks clear, beat a hasty path up to Pico
        do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arieiro</ENAMEX> first thing in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>. You should know by the time you
        arrive at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poiso</ENAMEX> whether or not the journey will be worth the
        effort.
        At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,818</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,900 ft</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico do Arieiro</ENAMEX> is the
        second-highest peak on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>, but the highest point reachable by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.
        As the road rises, the rugged countryside becomes spectacularly barren,
        though plunging volcanic hillsides have been softened and greened by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. If you‚Äôre driving, beware of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep straying</ENAMEX> onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
        The lookout point at the windswept, lunar-like summit
        provides a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">360</NUMEX>-degree panorama. With its stratified canyon walls, a
        field of frozen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lava</ENAMEX>, and boulders flung across the scene of volcanic
        catastrophe, it‚Äôs a geologist‚Äôs dream. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, the terrain is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parched</ENAMEX>, while at other times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> it‚Äôs often covered with snow.
        The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> temperature plunges below freezing most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>,
        while the average annual temperature is less than 10¬∞C (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50¬∞F</NUMEX>). There is
        also <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times as much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> here as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>. If the arrival of
        clouds catches you unaware, a welcome place of refuge is a modern
        pousada, a good stop for lunch and popular overnight stay with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>.
        At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,862</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,109 ft</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico Ruivo</ENAMEX>, the rooftop of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>,
        is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 62</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">209 ft</ENAMEX>) higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico do Arieiro</ENAMEX>, but much less
        accessible. The peak can be reached by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an</TIMEX> hour-long walk from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achada</ENAMEX> do
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teixeira</ENAMEX> in the north, or the classic but strenuous, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-hour</TIMEX> roundtrip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hike from Pico do Arieiro</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX>).
        The latter is well signposted, and there is a paved
        footpath, with drops protected by railings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trek</ENAMEX> is popular; on a
        good day you will see several other walkers, so don‚Äôt worry about
        losing your way. Warm clothing and hiking boots are essential, though,
        and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> bear in mind that conditions on the mountains can be
        hazardous, with landslides removing parts of the path. Check weather
        conditions from the tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>, then
        double-check at the pousada when you get there.
        Back on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> north (past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poiso</ENAMEX>) is the enchanting
        spot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeiro Frio</ENAMEX>, more a bend in the road than a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microclimate</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúCold River‚</ENAMEX>Äù makes this an ideal stopover‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe
        souvenir <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> along the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> are an indicator of the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that pop in. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Victor‚Äôs Bar</ENAMEX>, a restaurant resembling an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine</ENAMEX>
        chalet, receives most of them, warming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> with log fires and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">freshly grilled trout</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> hatchery across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
        Adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> is a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX> and small
        botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout hatchery</ENAMEX> is a series of inter¬≠connected
        concrete pools; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> become increasingly bigger as you go along
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>. The botanical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> is not in the same league as the
        beautiful gardens you will see in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>, but it nevertheless claims
        to have examples of every <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of flower, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> to be
        found on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>, and sprawls unpredictably along twisting paths among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shady trees</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ribeiro Frio</ENAMEX> is relaxing, but the real reason for its
        popularity are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> walks that begin here. The shorter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mile</ENAMEX>) to the outstanding lookout point known as the Balc√µes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(‚Äúbalconies‚Äù</ENAMEX>), takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just 45 minutes</TIMEX> roundtrip. After a stroll through
        the woods, you reach a platform that seems suspended in mid-air, with
        stupendous views across steep hillsides and dramatic ravines to the
        distinctive peaks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruivo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arieiro</ENAMEX>. If it‚Äôs not hidden in cloud
        cover, the sight certainly ranks as one of the most beautiful on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> walk is one of the island‚Äôs most popular levada
        trails. It continues for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just over 10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) until it reaches
        Portela, where a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> offers sustenance to weary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX>. The
        walk takes most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX>, so you may wish to arrange
        for a taxi to collect you at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portela</ENAMEX>. An alternative short walk is to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> out along the levada for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> or so (before steep drops
        begin), by which time you will certainly have been able to sample its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">charm</ENAMEX>, and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeiro Frio</ENAMEX>. Both options have food and
        drink waiting at the end.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Road</ENAMEX> to Santana
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ribeiro Frio</ENAMEX>, toward the coast, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faial</ENAMEX>, much
        photographed because of its picturesque setting at the foot of the
        Penha d‚Äô√Åguia. However, there‚Äôs little of note in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> itself,
        aside from a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa de Ch√</ENAMEX>° do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faial</ENAMEX>, which
        despite its name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">(‚ÄúFaial Tearoom‚Äù</ENAMEX>) is a standard restaurant with
        picture windows and fine roof-top panoramas.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> winds westward to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> memorable lookout
        points looking back at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santana</ENAMEX> is home
        to a quaint but primitive style of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">housing‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇA</ENAMEX>-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> known
        as palheiros (not to be confused with the A-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow huts</ENAMEX> that dot
        the hillsides all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX>). The classic palheiro is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story
        white stucco with a brightly painted red door, red-and-blue window
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frames</ENAMEX> and shutters, and above all, a thatched roof.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santana</ENAMEX> is frequently labeled one of the most attractive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> on the island, but its setting is the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>. The emerald
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hills</ENAMEX> and jagged coastline are reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland‚Äôs west</ENAMEX> coast.
        White <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> shrouded in mist dot the slopes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> itself is a
        rather straggly place with a modern town hall and no identifiable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> palheiros, perfectly painted in red, white, and blue, are
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> of many tourist cameras, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> immediately behind these
        remains a private home, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> desperate to keep out gawkers.
        Elsewhere, there are miniature palheiro <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog kennels</ENAMEX>, and
        down by the river even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> have their own palheiro. There is also
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">furnished ‚Äúshowhouse‚Äù palheiro</ENAMEX> (not always open) next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O Colmo</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurant</ENAMEX>, where you can see the extremely confined living space.
        More thatched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of a larger and more conventional
        kind are to be found <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santana</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queimadas</ENAMEX> is a
        complex of cottage-style rest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with attractive gardens. It‚Äôs a
        lovely spot for a picnic, although if the weather is clear you might
        prefer to take the opportunity to ascend to the very top of the island.
        This is reached by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 mile</NUMEX>) drive south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santana</ENAMEX>, through the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">forest park of Pico das Pedras</ENAMEX>, up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Achada do Teixeira</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,592</NUMEX> m
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,223 ft</NUMEX>). From here, it‚Äôs a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX> walk roundtrip to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico Ruivo</ENAMEX>
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>).
        The scenery northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santana</ENAMEX> is just as delightful.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S√£o Jorge</ENAMEX> has a fine, richly ornamented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, while past the village
        there is a splendid panorama from the miradouro of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabanas</ENAMEX>, over to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley of Arco de S√</ENAMEX>£o <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> winds inland towards the picturesque, fertile
        countryside in the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faj√</ENAMEX>£ do <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penedo</ENAMEX> and on to the pretty
        village of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boaventura</ENAMEX>. To enjoy excellent views, follow the coast road
        down to the small peninsula of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponta Delgada</ENAMEX>, where you can cool off by
        the rocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seawater</ENAMEX> swimming pool. From here it‚Äôs just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Vicente</ENAMEX>, at which point the road heads south to Ribeira
        Brava, then east back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> Madeira
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">eastern</ENAMEX> section of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> isn‚Äôt as mountainous as its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, but it has some wonderful coastal spots, a handful of
        attractive small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, productive agricultural fields, and a long,
        surreal promontory that juts out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>.
        As you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX>, the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santo da Serra</ENAMEX>
        can also be reached via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camacha</ENAMEX> or from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poiso</ENAMEX> cross¬≠roads. The
        altitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">670 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,200 ft</NUMEX>) produces refreshing breezes, and explains
        why several wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expats</ENAMEX> have chosen to build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quintas</ENAMEX> here
        and why so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">affluent</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeirans</ENAMEX> still flee the hot Funchal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> up
        into these hills.
        The most striking feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santo da Serra</ENAMEX> is its
        flatness; it may not be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pa√∫l da Serra</ENAMEX>, but it is still
        large enough to accommodate a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>-hole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>). Even
        if you‚Äôre not much of a golfer, you might still enjoy a stroll through
        the pleasant gardens of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinta da Junta</ENAMEX>, once owned by the ubiquitous
        Blandy family but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> public. A lookout point provides views across
        to Machico on the coast, and you can enjoy a drink at the golf club
        bar, set in what was once a pousada.
        At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portela</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">662 m/2,172 ft</NUMEX>), the views of the coast are
        striking. If you‚Äôre lucky, you may see a hang glider take off from a
        nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>. Penha d‚Äô√Åguia dominates the northeast coast. This huge
        rock formation, towering at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">590 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,935 ft</NUMEX>), levels off to a flat top.
        The name, meaning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eagle Rock</ENAMEX>, is derived from its former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>
        rather than its shape.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto da Cruz</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) north, lies
        in the shadow of the rock. Here you will find one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚</ENAMEX>Äôs few
        sugarcane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX> still working, pumping out steam as it processes the
        sugarcane to make aguardente, the local liquor. It doesn‚Äôt operate all
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round, however, and it is open to the public only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>. The
        village is neat and tidy, but there‚Äôs nothing to detain you for very
        long.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machico</ENAMEX> can claim to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first settlement, the
        spot where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco</ENAMEX> first came ashore on the island in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1419</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zarco</ENAMEX> ruled the western <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>, while his fellow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Portuguese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">navigator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trist√£o Vaz Teixeira</ENAMEX>, governed over
        the eastern <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Machico</ENAMEX>. A statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teixeira</ENAMEX> stands outside the
        town‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> parish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Igreja Matriz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Manuel</ENAMEX> I donated
        the statue of the Virgin (over the altar) and the distinguished church
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">portal</ENAMEX>. The latter is a fine example of the exuberant style of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Manueline</ENAMEX> architecture.
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Machico‚Äôs triangular ‚Äúsquare</ENAMEX>,‚Äù several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> lead
        to the seafront‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa dark, pebbly beach with a small fort dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1706</TIMEX>.
        The local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fishermen‚Äôs quarters</ENAMEX> lie just east of the river, where cows
        graze along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, a scene unexpected in sub-tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>,
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> are usually confined to tiny huts.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machico</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ma¬≠dei¬≠ra‚Äôs</ENAMEX> boat-building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>, and
        on the beach you will probably see work in progress on both old and new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessels</ENAMEX>, the former being used for scrap. With the aid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> funding,
        large, new tuna <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> are being built to replace old stock. Follow the
        road all the way around the bay for a fine view across, east to west.
        The incongruous high-rise blot on the landscape directly opposite is
        the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Dom</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro</ENAMEX>, rather out-of-place in this low-key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>,
        but an indicator of its tourism ambitions.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> north heads inland after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machico</ENAMEX>. A huge,
        fenced-off area is under construction as a zona franca‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtax-free
        business development area‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇintended to attract foreign investment.
        With so little in the way of industrial development elsewhere on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> is particularly startling.
        The landscape of the eastern peninsula, known as the Ponta
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de S√£o Louren√ßo</ENAMEX>, is more like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Santo</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ilhas Desertas</ENAMEX> than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>. It is wild and windswept, and its limited vegetation a far cry
        from the lush green interior. Keen walkers enjoy this tip of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX>, but for many it is a little too invigorating for comfort.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cani√ßal</ENAMEX> was once a famous whaling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, but since whaling
        was banned in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, all that remains of this formerly
        lucrative industry is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum of Whaling</ENAMEX> and a few scrimshaw and
        whalebone souvenirs in a hut by the beach (more of the same is on sale
        at the car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at the end of the road heading east).
        Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Museu da Baleia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whale Museum</ENAMEX>) shows a video
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale hunt</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> is the epitome of a poacher turned
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gamekeeper</ENAMEX>. Once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cani√</ENAMEX>ßal whaling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and thus
        responsible for taking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100‚Äì200</NUMEX> of the great c reatures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>, he
        now devotes his energy to saving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX> and other marine life of the
        area. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14-meter</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45-foot</NUMEX>) model of the sperm <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">whale</ENAMEX> is a reminder of
        the leviathans that once swam in great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in the waters off
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Whales</ENAMEX> are still sighted here, but not frequently.
        The beach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cani√ßal</ENAMEX> now looks rather forlorn, with
        rotting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hulks</ENAMEX> and flotsam and jetsam testifying to better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>.
        Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a working fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, complete with a selection of
        good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Close by, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prainha</ENAMEX>, is the island‚Äôs only
        natural sandy beach. Not surprisingly for a volcanic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>, the sand
        here is black, and even this stretch is sometimes washed away.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> is a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX>, with an
        attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. Across the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>,
        the town hall, in spite of having been modernized, retains a pair of
        splendid 15th- to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Manueline</ENAMEX> windows. A few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> away,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courthouse</ENAMEX> is another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> of that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>, with fine verandas and
        an impressive main staircase. Along the seafront is the modern
        municipal market and a pebbly beach.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> is best known for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeroporto de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Cataria</ENAMEX> (international <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>) that serves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funchal</ENAMEX> and all of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> it was still undergoing a massive expansion. As you
        continue driving east, you actually travel underneath the runway, which
        is supported on huge pillars above <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">you‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> novel (not to mention rather
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sobering</ENAMEX>) sensation both for those above and below.
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> along the coast toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Funchal</ENAMEX> passes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cani√ßo</ENAMEX>, the first settlement of any real size. The original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is
        built around an imposing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, while the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cani√ßo de</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baixa</ENAMEX> is a sprawling proliferation of smart holiday homes visible from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afar</ENAMEX>.
        After <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">roughly another mile</NUMEX>, turn off the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponta do Garajau</ENAMEX>, a holiday development popular with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> ends at a fine miradouro, where a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> stands with
        arms outstretched (a miniature version of the statues at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rio de Janeiro</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lisbon</ENAMEX>). There is also a good view west to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Funchal</ENAMEX>; to
        the east, the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> on the small promontory is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cani√ßo de Baixa</ENAMEX>,
        another favorite with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> dropping down into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funchal</ENAMEX> winds past some of the
        town‚Äôs smartest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villas</ENAMEX>. The first landmark you‚Äôll see is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√£o Gon√</ENAMEX>ßalo in the parish of the same name. Also in the vicinity is the
        tiny, atmospheric <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX> dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nossa Senhora</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">das</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neves</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snows</ENAMEX>).
        Porto Santo
        The island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Santo</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of
        Madeira, is the only other inhabited island in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">archipelago</ENAMEX>, with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 5,000</NUMEX>. As desert islands go, it‚Äôs not exactly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undiscovered‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit‚Äôs</ENAMEX> accessible by ferry or very short flight‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut only
        a handful of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> find these shores. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Santo</ENAMEX> is still,
        at heart, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeirans</ENAMEX>, who seek what they have not:
        sand.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Santo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs prize is a long, golden beach, only recently
        touched by development. But that‚Äôs not all that distinguishes Porto
        Santo from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madeira</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is scorched and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow</ENAMEX>, with rusty-colored rock and cliff formations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is
        mostly quiet, with a short, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-month summer</TIMEX> season. Out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>,
        however, even the main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> seems deserted.
        The frequently rough sea crossing drops <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto de Abrigo</ENAMEX>, on the eastern tip of the island. (The return
        crossing, however, is never as bad. ) From the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> it is a short taxi
        or bus ride, or a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20-minute</TIMEX> walk, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Baleira</ENAMEX> (sometimes referred
        to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Santo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>), the island‚Äôs only settlement of notable
        size.
        The center of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Baleira</ENAMEX> is a small, triangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>,
        comprising a small town hall and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> now restored after more than
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries</TIMEX> of use. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nossa Senhora da Piedade</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of Piety</ENAMEX>)
        was originally founded just after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">island‚Äôs</ENAMEX> discovery during the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early- to middle-15th century</TIMEX>. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> was rebuilt after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pirates</ENAMEX> destroyed the original in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1667</TIMEX>, though part of it, the Morgada
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chapel</ENAMEX>, did survive.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Santo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs claim to fame, beyond its sandy beach, is
        its link to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>. The town‚Äôs major attraction is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> that stands next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, set back a little off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casa de Colombo</ENAMEX> (closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>) dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> and has
        recently been restored. It‚Äôs an atmospheric little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, built from
        rough-hewn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>; it‚Äôs not hard to imagine the great explorer living
        here.
        The story of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Madeiran archipelago</ENAMEX> is not
        entirely apocryphal, unlike so many other tales related to the islands.
        Columbus married <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipa Moniz Perestrelo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Santo, Bartolomeu Perestrelo</ENAMEX>. However, there is no
        strong evidence that he ever lived here. Still, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> claims that
        around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1480</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Columbus</ENAMEX> lived here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> and that young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego Columbo</ENAMEX> was born a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portosantense</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.
        Regardless of the truth, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casa de Colombo</ENAMEX> is worth a visit.
        Displays include period pieces, memorabilia, replicas, maps, paintings,
        and sketches, though no personal effects or anything directly linked to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> himself. Another curious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enigma</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> that has baffled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">historians</ENAMEX> is that no reliable likeness of him has ever survived. Take
        a look at the portraits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, and then compare them with the
        dashing, modern bust of him in the public gardens by the quay.
        The most interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Baleira</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rua Jo√</ENAMEX>£o
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gon√ßalves Zarco</ENAMEX>, on the other side of the river, running down to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX>. Here you will find the town‚Äôs small market and a number of old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> with plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.
        An <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Island Tour</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Santo</ENAMEX> is tiny (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than 11 km by 6 km/6 miles</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>). It doesn‚Äôt require much sightseeing, which is good, because
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just come to bake on the beach. Hiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is expensive,
        and what there is to see is usually near the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taxis</ENAMEX> will
        take you around the island, giving their own tours at fixed prices (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">page 120</ENAMEX>). Pick up a leaflet from the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and ask for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">driver</ENAMEX> who can speak your language. Another alternative is to take a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minibus</ENAMEX> tour with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blandy‚Äôs.</ENAMEX>
        Heading around the island in a counter-clockwise
        direction, the first stop is the lookout point of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portela</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163 m/535</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>). From here, you can survey the whole <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) of the golden,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sandy</ENAMEX> beach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> north, however, and the desolate nature of the
        landscape is inescapable. Crop yield is poor, partly because of the
        chronic lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and fields once tended are now deserted. Earning
        a living from tourism here is, to most, more appealing than toiling in
        the fields.
        The island‚Äôs highest peak, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">517 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">695 ft</ENAMEX>), is Pico do
        Facho, situated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 1.5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mile</NUMEX>) due north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portela</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll
        need to don hiking boots to get to the summit. Its name, ‚ÄúPeak of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torch</ENAMEX>,‚Äù is taken from the warning beacons that were lit here in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> posed a threat to the island.
        The circular road now arcs north to the diminutive village
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camacha</ENAMEX>, where the principal attraction is a picturesque old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">windmill‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇone</ENAMEX> of the last few still working on the island. If it is
        closed, ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> if you can look inside; they‚Äôre likely to fetch the
        friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mill owner</ENAMEX> to come and open up for you. Nearby, a ramshackle
        winery with an antique wooden <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> produces the local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Porto</ENAMEX> Santo
        wine. If it is closed, you can still sample the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> in either of the
        village‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>-bars.
        A minor road heads west out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camacha</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fonte da Areia</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(‚ÄúSand Spring‚Äù</ENAMEX>), where the rugged coastline is particularly lovely.
        Sandstone cliffs and rocks have been weathered into interesting shapes
        and small caves. A spring filtering through the rocks is the source of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">island‚Äôs mineral water</ENAMEX>.
        The main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> continues its loop, bringing you just about
        back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila Baleira</ENAMEX>, before a minor road heads north again towards
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico do Castelo</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a couple of hundred yards</NUMEX> from Pico do
        Facho, and from its height of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">437 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,433 ft</NUMEX>), accessible by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>,
        provides a quite commanding view itself.
        The old, rusted cannons are all that remain of the
        fortifications that once protected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>. Nowadays
        it‚Äôs a popular spot for picnics and barbecues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Santo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airfield</ENAMEX>
        (much larger than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeira</ENAMEX> before the latter was expanded),
        lies just below.
        A favorite local picnic spot is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morenos</ENAMEX>, towards the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southwest</ENAMEX> tip of the island, though close to, and looking out over, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX> coast. It is neat and well-tended with sunshades, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and
        seats, and enjoys a picturesque view over to the tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ilheu de Ferro</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">(‚ÄúIsle of Iron‚Äù</ENAMEX>). The last viewpoint of the tour is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico das Flores</ENAMEX>, at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">184 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">603 ft</ENAMEX>). From here you can see north along the beach; the only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blot</ENAMEX> on the landscape is the unfinished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novo Mondo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hotel‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa notorious</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-story white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> completely out of proportion with the rest of
        the island.
        Directly beneath <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico das Flores</ENAMEX> is the southern end of
        the beach and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Santo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs easternmost point, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponta da</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calheta</ENAMEX>. The rest of the island‚Äôs beach is a long, uninterrupted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expanse</ENAMEX>, backed by attractive but slightly featureless dunes. Here,
        however, there are small bays with picturesque, rocky outcrops and you
        can enjoy a beautiful view across to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ilheu de Baixo</ENAMEX>.
