        Where, indeed? This subcontinent is so rich and varied that
        the choice of what to see on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> visit can be daunting. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> even
        think of ‚Äúdoing‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ‚Äúdo‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. With some judicious
        selection from among the places we suggest, you can most certainly get
        a pretty good feel for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> that most people
        devote to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trip.
        Even if you have a distinct taste for improvisation and a
        horror of schedules and detailed itineraries, you must accept from the
        outset, if your time is at all limited, that travelling around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>
        will demand a certain amount of planning. Remember, there are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">844</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> out there, and a lot of them will be on the move at the
        same time as you will be, therefore competing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> seats and hotel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. So you will need to make at least some advance reservations for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> in principal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and especially for your major <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> or train
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journeys</ENAMEX>. This will still leave you plenty of room for getting off the
        beaten track and staying overnight in new and unexpected places.
        Putting Together an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Itinerary</ENAMEX>
        We have divided the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">regions‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnorth</ENAMEX>, west,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>, east, and south.
        In each of the regions, you‚Äôll find a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>,
        Mumbai, or Chennai which you can use as a starting point, and which
        would also be the best place for phoning home and making other
        practical arrangements. Equally important, each area includes a place
        where, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hallowed</TIMEX> and sensible military phrasing, you can go for rest
        and recreation. In this case, you‚Äôll find a beach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, nature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reserve</ENAMEX>, or one of the old hill-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Raj</ENAMEX>, each being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ideal</ENAMEX> for a change of pace or climate. It‚Äôs easy to overdose on the
        many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. They are all worth your
        attention, but do take plenty of time to relax, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">too‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou‚</ENAMEX>Äôll be
        surprised at how much more you can see and appreciate if you‚Äôve had
        enough rest.
        If your budget allows you to fly around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, you can
        design a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsmorgasbord‚Äù</ENAMEX> of places to see in each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX>, since you will
        not be able to do all of them exhaustively. In any case, we recommend
        that you choose from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> of them, ideally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, when planning
        your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúmenu</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Information</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> can be very helpful. You will
        find their guides are much more reliable than those outside the temples
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, but one word of warning: different tour guides will give
        contradictory explanations about the significance of statues as well as
        many different versions of legend and historical ‚Äúfact. ‚Äù It would be
        easy to dismiss these explanations as being nonsense, but you‚Äôll
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">understand India</ENAMEX> better if you can appreciate that what each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> is
        saying may in its own way be true. When it comes to ideas, there is no
        more tolerant land on earth.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Practical Hints</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Handy Travel Tips</ENAMEX> section at the back of the book
        offers details on how to handle the practical side of your trip, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">it‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worth keeping a few points in mind when deciding where you‚Äôre
        going in the time you have available.
        The climate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">235</NUMEX>) imposes its own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">imperatives</ENAMEX> and restrictions on your itinerary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern India</ENAMEX> is
        simply impractical in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> unbearably hot in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, and
        trains uncertain in the monsoon. Think of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three seasons</TIMEX>, cool, hot, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wet</ENAMEX>, emphasized here because they take on a particular meaning in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> context.
        The cool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> is from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October to March</TIMEX>, the ideal time
        for seeing most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> (‚ÄÇexcept in the northern hills and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>,
        where it‚Äôs bitterly cold). Cool means it is pleasantly warm by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, and
        fresh enough for a sweater in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>. The temperature begins to
        rise by mid-February. Hot, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April to June</TIMEX>, is hot as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> only
        rarely experience it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and plains in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this season</TIMEX> are
        definitely a bad bet, but the hill-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> will be at their best. From
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-June to September</TIMEX>, wet means monsoon-wet, not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day every day</TIMEX>,
        but torrential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX> occur often enough to make travel uncertain and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> and other bugs a real nuisance. However, during this
        time the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is at its most green, and the monuments, especially
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>, take on a glistening beauty.
        With regard to your health (see also page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">241</NUMEX>), two
        attitudes herald a miserable time: carelessness and hypochondria. Take
        elementary precautions by sticking to bottled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> and freshly cooked
        food, and you won‚Äôt have any serious stomach problems. An occasional
        touch of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúDelhi belly‚Äù</ENAMEX> is unavoidable when you‚Äôre not used to the spicy
        food, but nothing to worry about; take it easy and drink lots of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liquids</ENAMEX>, and it‚Äôll pass. If you are on a short trip, you may need to
        take a quick-acting remedy to keep you on your feet, but if you load up
        with antibiotics and a host of other patent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> will
        never build up resistance, and the next attack will just be worse.
        There is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> essential: protect yourself from the heat.
        Save your sun-tanning for the beach or the hotel swimming pool.
        Otherwise, stay out of the sun. Wear a nicely ventilated hat and keep
        to the shade in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>. Try to do your open air sightseeing in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning and late afternoon</TIMEX>. Take a siesta after lunch. Drink plenty of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liquids‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇin the heat, dehydration is more of a risk than an upset
        stomach.
        In all senses of the word, stay cool. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few days</TIMEX>
        jet-lag, acclimatization, and culture shock may lead you to lose your
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temper</ENAMEX> when you see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railways</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> not organized in
        a way you‚Äôre used to, but don‚Äôt <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">forget‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇJohn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Galbraith</ENAMEX> called
        it a functioning anarchy. Count to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, and, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> belly, it‚Äôll
        pass. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Airports</ENAMEX>, railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> can be a pain anywhere in
        the world <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> are mostly cheerful, responding much more
        readily to a smile than a scowl.
        The red tape can at times seem like barbed wire, but this,
        too, can be handled. Part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs legacy after several centuries of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> (don‚Äôt just blame the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> civil service‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit began long
        before) is an inordinate respect for the written document and the
        rubber stamp. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don‚Äôt</ENAMEX> knock it‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇuse it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vouchers</ENAMEX>, passes, letters of
        introduction, and printed business cards all work like magic when a
        ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù reservation has become ‚Äúunconfirmed. ‚Äù
        If you should be travelling by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253</NUMEX>) and
        rate comfort above improvisation, go <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indrail Pass</ENAMEX>.
        It saves you time in queues and gets you preferential treatment with
        reservations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Airlines‚Äô Discover India</ENAMEX> plan offers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 days</TIMEX> of
        unlimited travel and is less economic than single tickets, but buy them
        en bloc with confirmed reservations that you should reconfirm at each
        new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
        Echoing around every office you will hear the cheerful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sentence: ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúNo problem. ‚Äù Though it rarely means exactly this, interpret
        it as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">meaning ‚Äúno catastrophe‚Äù</ENAMEX> and have a good time anyway.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORTH</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> embraces the government
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">capital‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe heart</ENAMEX> of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mughal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX>, and the nature
        reserves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corbett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bharatpur</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayan</ENAMEX> mountains there is
        the hill-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Simla‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich</ENAMEX> once served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> summer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capital‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand the magical but dangerous region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Delhi</ENAMEX>
        On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yamuna</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jumna</ENAMEX>) river at the western end of the great
        Ganga valley, the capital seems to have been a coveted place for
        India‚Äôs conquerors. Though they each very often destroyed the work of
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">city</ENAMEX> remains a fascinating
        compendium of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs imperial history.
        Recent archaeological findings suggest that a site on the
        Yamuna river may have been the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahabharata</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yudhishthira</ENAMEX>,
        dating back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> b.c. A rock inscription from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashoka</ENAMEX>
        indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> was a major point on the trade route between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwest</ENAMEX> frontier and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bengal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomara Rajputs</ENAMEX> made it their capital in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">736</TIMEX>, with the
        name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dhillika</ENAMEX>, and it was a focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> wars until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>
        conquered it and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qutb-ud-din Aybak</ENAMEX> set up his sultanate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1206</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Delhi</ENAMEX>
        was dismantled to make way for new monuments which then suffered from
        the devastating passage of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Timur the Lame</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1398</TIMEX>. He took away <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>-loads of building materials and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stonemasons</ENAMEX> and sculptors to build his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samarkand</ENAMEX>. With the
        advent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1526</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> alternated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX> as the
        capital, and each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> asserted his particular taste in architectural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">caprice</ENAMEX>.
        Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> took a back seat to the ports
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcutta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madras</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1911</TIMEX>, when it became once more a
        proud imperial capital. No less vain than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughals</ENAMEX>, the new
        conquerors all added their own architectural tastes, which were a
        tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs past but unmistakably <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in overall conception,
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX>.
        Today, a tour of the capital takes you through a mixture of
        imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX>, modern office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>,
        and along the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Delhi</ENAMEX> of vibrant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>
        crowding in on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughal</ENAMEX> monuments. For more orientation, visit the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Information Office</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janpath</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delhi</ENAMEX> of the Sultans
        Start at the southern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qutb Minar</ENAMEX>,
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islam‚</ENAMEX>Äôs impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. Begun by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delhi‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first sultan</ENAMEX>,
        Qutb-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ud</NUMEX>-din, and completed by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son-in-law</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iltutmish</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>-m
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">240-ft</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> was erected to celebrate the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stories, each a tapering cylinder with angular
        and convex ribs, separated by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>.
        The top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is off limits, due to dangers inherent
        in the narrow staircase that leads to the look-out point, so the best
        bet for a panoramic view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is the top floor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">taller</ENAMEX>, more recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>.
        The ruins of the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quwwatu‚</ENAMEX>Äôl-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islam</ENAMEX>-Masjid
        (which means ‚ÄúThe Might of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islam‚Äù</ENAMEX>), was built with the might of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus</ENAMEX>. With no skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> labor at his disposal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qutb</ENAMEX> called on
        local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> from the ruins of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> and Jain
        temples, demolished by their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>. You can see the results of
        this construction method in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>-pillars set on top of one
        another. Sculptures have been plastered over, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> carving
        remains. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> architecture shows in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> characteristic peaked
        arches of the prayer-hall screen, but even here the decoration, which
        includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> lettering, is naturalistic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> in style.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mosque‚Äôs courtyard</ENAMEX>, there is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>-ft) Iron
        Pillar, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX>, brought here by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajput</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of
        Dhillika, but nobody knows from where. Without rust after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX> years
        worth of monsoon, this monument to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu god Vishnu</ENAMEX> is said to have
        special properties: if you stand with your back against it and
        completely encircle it with your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">arms‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇno mean feat‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgood</ENAMEX> luck is
        yours for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the day</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX> of the Mughals
        Due east of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Delhi‚Äôs India Gate</ENAMEX> the much-plundered
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purana Qila</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Fort</ENAMEX>) stands on an ancient mound, now
        believed to mark the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Indraprastha of the Mahabharata</ENAMEX> epic.
        The earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Qal‚Äôa-i-Kuhna-Masjid</ENAMEX>,
        with its minutely detailed molding of graceful peaked arches,
        represents an important transition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turco</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> to the
        sophisticated style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX>-influenced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> was
        built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1541</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sher Shah</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babur‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. Sher-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mandal</ENAMEX>, the octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> due south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>,
        served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">General‚Äôs pleasure-palace</ENAMEX>, but it was to be the death of
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humayun</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>).
        From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humayun‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death came the splendid monument located in
        Nizamuddin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb of Humayun</ENAMEX>, which was built by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX> Haji
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begum</ENAMEX> and the inspiration for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>. It is set back on a raised
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">terrace</ENAMEX> in a set of walled-in tree-shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> surrounded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedges</ENAMEX>,
        but without the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> once running in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> (‚Äúrivers of life‚Äù),
        or the rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> that were to be the perfect setting for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taj</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humayun‚Äôs Tomb</ENAMEX> has a remarkable charm of its own, a site for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repose</ENAMEX> and serenity made from a delicate combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">materials‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbuff</ENAMEX>-and-red sandstone and smart, grey-trimmed white
        marble. With a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">majestic dome</ENAMEX> uniting the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX> over the
        terrace‚Äôs latticed arches, this is the first fully-realized masterpiece
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mughal</ENAMEX> architecture. The numerous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-pointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> set in the
        abutments of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arches</ENAMEX> are not the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Star</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> but an
        esoteric emblem that you‚Äôll see all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        Dominating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Delhi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lal Quila</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Red Fort</ENAMEX>) was built by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shahjahan</ENAMEX> when he transferred the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Agra</ENAMEX>.
        Behind its ramparts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> citadel is more a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> than a
        fortress, with white marble preferred over the region‚Äôs red sandstone.
        It‚Äôs thought he used the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> who worked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahal</ENAMEX>.
        From south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX>, notice the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monumental elephants</ENAMEX>
        outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Delhi Gate</ENAMEX>. Part of the original design, they were
        destroyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aurangzeb</ENAMEX>, who refused images susceptible to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">idolatry</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Viceroy</ENAMEX> Lord <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curzon</ENAMEX> had these replicas installed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1903</TIMEX>.
        Enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX> on its west side at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lahore Gate</ENAMEX>, and you find
        yourself in a vaulted bazaar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, an idea <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shahjahan</ENAMEX> borrowed from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>. Imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajput</ENAMEX> princes riding on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>
        through the arcade as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naqqar Khana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drum House</ENAMEX>), where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> played and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> were obliged to dismount.
        Pass with the ghosts of these nobles and commoners through
        the drum <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diwan-i-Am</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Public Audience</ENAMEX>). Here, under
        a baldaquin with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> pillars, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> sat cross-legged on his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">throne</ENAMEX>, the ‚ÄúSeat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shadow</ENAMEX> of God. ‚Äù He held <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX>, surrounded
        by nobles, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>, while common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">petitioners</ENAMEX> attended in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> below. As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX>, you can admire the inlaid stone panels
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> at the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>.
        Entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diwan-i-Khas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Private Audience</ENAMEX>) was
        for the privileged, by ticket only. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find it on the left, among
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace apartments</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yamuna</ENAMEX> river. Beautiful as it is, with
        carved designs on the marble columns and cusped arches, imagine it in
        its full glory before the ravages of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir Shah</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1739</TIMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> chipped the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> out of its pillars and inlay off the ceiling,
        and then carted away the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">fabulous Peacock Throne</ENAMEX>. Above the arches
        you‚Äôll see the inscription:
        ‚ÄúIf paradise on earth there be,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äò Tis</ENAMEX> here, ‚Äòtis here, ‚Äòtis here! ‚Äù
        The last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> to enjoy it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George V</ENAMEX>, for whom a
        painted wooden ceiling was installed.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the few surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace apartments</ENAMEX> is the principal
        harem, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rang Mahal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color</ENAMEX>). The walls‚Äô paintings have gone and
        water no longer flows in its indoor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Nahr-i-Bihisht</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">River of Paradise</ENAMEX>),
        but mosaics made of mirrors ornament the ceiling and walls of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
        boudoirs, making a galaxy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> when candle-lit (strike a match).
        Southernmost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace buildings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mumtaz Mahal</ENAMEX> was part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial</ENAMEX> harem and is now a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mughal</ENAMEX> artwork.
        To the northwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diwan-i-Khas</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moti</ENAMEX> Masjid
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl Mosque</ENAMEX>) is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> contribution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shahjahan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aurangzeb</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Each evening</TIMEX>, a sound and light show at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fort</ENAMEX> tells its story; details can be obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Bureau</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandni Chowk</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort‚Äôs Lahore Gate</ENAMEX>, was
        once an avenue for processions. Today, it is the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX>
        linking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delhi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs bazaars, which sell jewelry, clothes, and traditional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sweetmeats</ENAMEX>.
        On an outcrop of rock southwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red Fort</ENAMEX>,
        Shahjahan‚Äôs other great construction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jama Masjid</ENAMEX> (the great
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">congregational ‚ÄúFriday Mosque‚Äù</ENAMEX>), is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. The
        inadvisability of a mo rning or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX> visit on hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> will
        become apparent when you see the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pyramidal flights of stairs to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">gate-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-sq-m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,076-sq-ft</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is enclosed by
        long colonnades with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> at each corner. The prayer hall
        highlights the emperor‚Äôs aesthetic, in the lotus calyx on the gateway‚Äôs
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lantern shafts, the delicately flaring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> on the minarets,
        and the stripes to emphasize the bulbous marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raj Ghat</ENAMEX>, the simple memorial to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahatma Gandhi</ENAMEX> overlooking
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yamuna river</ENAMEX>, is far in spirit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughals</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">an integral</ENAMEX>
        part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Delhi</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> planted with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> donated by visiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads of state</ENAMEX>, a square of marble marks the place where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cremated</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> has an inscription recording his last words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√</ENAMEX>©
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ram</ENAMEX> (Oh, God), and nearby, a sign declares that most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX>
        talisman: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúRecall the face of the poorest and most helpless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> whom
        you may have seen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going
        to be of any help to him. ‚Äù There is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> recording the
        highlights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gandhi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs life.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX>
        Those nostalgic for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Empire</ENAMEX> please note: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Clive</ENAMEX>
        Road has been named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyagraja</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Victoria Road</ENAMEX> has become Rajendra
        Prasad, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curzon</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kasturba Gandhi</ENAMEX>. Though the statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> have also disappeared, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX> remains in the city‚Äôs
        planning. Faithful to the policy of separating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> cantonment
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX> as the barrier, the new city
        built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Empire‚Äôs Indian</ENAMEX> seat of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is separated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> by the line running from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amritsar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Neo-Classic</ENAMEX>
        architecture here is mixed with elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX>, and Mughal
        past, and the geometry of its plan exudes the self-confidence of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. As a visiting statesman once said of it: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúWhat splendid ruins
        it will make! ‚Äù
        The commercial pivot of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX> is the circular arcade
        and bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roundabout</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> Place. With cinemas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>, travel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, and the better craft emporiums, it‚Äôs a place
        whose new name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indira Chowk</ENAMEX>, does not seem to catch on. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>
        Place straddles the northeast‚Äìsouthwest axis which links the Jama
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masjid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Delhi</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚Äôs parliament</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansad Bhavan</ENAMEX>.
        Designed by the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Baker</ENAMEX>, the rather too massive,
        colonnaded rotunda of the parliament <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is at its best
        illuminated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Viceroy‚Äôs Residence</ENAMEX>, now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rashtrapati Bhavan</ENAMEX> has wings radiating from the great grey-blue <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> of
        the central block and the tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> of its gardens, and
        so bespeaks the grandeur of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs heyday. It looms from an
        artificial hill along the processional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajpath</ENAMEX> (once <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingsway</ENAMEX>),
        which is flanked by parklands, where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> holds its marches on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic Day</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 January</TIMEX>. At the other end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajpath</ENAMEX> stands <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>
        Gate, the war memorial designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutyens</ENAMEX> in the style of a triumphal
        arch that pays tribute to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> who died in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">War I.</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jantar Mantar</ENAMEX>, set south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> Place, is perhaps
        the strangest monument in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX>. It is difficult to believe that
        these bizarre shapes, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">staircases</ENAMEX> going nowhere, and windows in walls
        without <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> were built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1724</TIMEX> by a serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, rather than in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last century</TIMEX> by some deranged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>. It is in fact the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">astrologico‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthat</ENAMEX> is, the astronomical <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">observatory‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇof Rajput prince</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jai Singh II</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaipur</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>). Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centerpiece</ENAMEX> is the
        right-angled triangle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samrat Yantra</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Instrument</ENAMEX>), with a
        dome acting as a sun-dial, ‚Äúaccurate to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. ‚Äù In addition to
        this structure, he built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> more‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin Ujjain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi, Mathura</ENAMEX>, and
        his native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jaipur</ENAMEX>.
        Near here, surely the liveliest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of all,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanuman Mandir</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Monkey</ENAMEX> God) is a theatre where you can
        witness the joyous atmosphere of popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hinduism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanuman</ENAMEX> is a
        beneficent deity predating classical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinduism</ENAMEX>, and the reason why no
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> would dream of harming the little lemurs (monkeys) running around
        here.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Museums</ENAMEX>
        In what is artistically a predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mughal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Museum</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janpath</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Queensway</ENAMEX>) just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajpath</ENAMEX>, is worth
        a visit for its collection of old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> sculpture, in particular those
        from medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vijayanagar</ENAMEX>.
        Railway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> will surely enjoy the display of the
        country‚Äôs early steam engines at the open air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rail Transport Museum</ENAMEX>. It
        is situated in the diplomatic neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanakyapuri</ENAMEX> (behind the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhutan Embassy</ENAMEX>). Adventurous as rail travel in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> still is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,
        one exhibit belongs hopefully in the past: the skull of an elephant
        that nearly derailed a mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1894</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nehru Memorial Museum</ENAMEX> is devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">life of India‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first Prime Minister</ENAMEX>. It is located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nehru</ENAMEX> inherited from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX>-in-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teen</ENAMEX>

        Agra
        Location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX> is the most popular sight
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. Even if the place had nothing else, it would be worth the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trip</ENAMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj</ENAMEX>, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> calls it affectionately, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsight‚Äù</ENAMEX> that
        awakens the wonder and enthusiasm of the most blas√©, world-weary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveller</ENAMEX>.
        But there‚Äôs plenty more. Agra was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>, the site of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikandra</ENAMEX>,
        and, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several miles</NUMEX> west at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatehpur Sikri</ENAMEX>, of the marvellous deserted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> he built to celebrate the birth of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and which he abandoned to
        fight on the northwest frontier. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Heirs</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> originally
        brought here continue a tradition in jewelry, brassware, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX>, and
        inlaid marble.
        The first historical mention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX> is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1501</TIMEX>, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sultan Sikandar Lodi</ENAMEX> made it his capital. Babur captured it along with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Koh-i-Nur</ENAMEX> diamond now in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> crown jewels. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar</ENAMEX> chose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jahangir</ENAMEX> made it a major focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> Shahjahan
        lost his taste for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX> after finishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mumtaz-Mahal</ENAMEX> after she had died. He moved the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>
        again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1648</TIMEX>, leaving the city‚Äôs treasure to vandals (including the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>) after the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1857 Mutiny</ENAMEX>, until the viceroys organized its
        restoration. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is the effects of pollution that are taking their
        toll on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra‚</ENAMEX>Äôs monuments.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>
        This is truly a monument for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all seasons</TIMEX>. There are those
        who swear by the sight on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharad Purnima</ENAMEX>, the
        first full moon after the monsoons, a cloudless <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
        when the light is at its clearest and also most romantic. Others love
        to see it in the middle of the heaviest monsoon, its marble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">translucent</ENAMEX>, its image blurred in the rain-stippled water channels of
        its gardens. But its magic is strong at any time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, and any
        moment of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>, its color changes from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> to
        rose-pink, and at sunset it is golden. Observe it, too, in the
        brilliance of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>, for then it is utterly, dazzlingly white. On
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> with a full moon, the grounds stay open till <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>.
        The gateway to the gardens of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> can be admired
        as a masterpiece in its own right, with noble marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arches</ENAMEX>, the domed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kiosks</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> corner turrets, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rows of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> small chhattri
        (umbrella-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>) just above the entrance. It provides <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> with the
        perfect frame for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> view of the ensemble. You will find that
        long-range photography is allowed, but it is forbidden to take pictures
        inside the monument.
        The chharbagh (foursquare) gardens are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">an integral part of</ENAMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>, both spiritually, as the symbol of the paradise to which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mumtaz-Mahal</ENAMEX> has ascended, and artistically, to enhance the color and
        texture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX>. The dark cypresses heighten the brilliance of
        the monument‚Äôs marble, and the water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, meeting at a broad
        central viewing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX>, not only provide a perfect <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> image, but
        also, with the reflection of the sky, add at dawn and sunset a subtle
        illumination from below.
        Exquisite harmony and refined symmetry are the keynotes of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> itself. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is clad in miraculously white
        marble from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajasthan</ENAMEX> quarries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Makrana</ENAMEX>, achieving a magnificent
        texture with the subtly alternating broad and narrow slabs. Standing
        protectively at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> corners of the raised <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX>, the minarets
        are, deferentially, slightly lower than the sublime central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cupola</ENAMEX>.
        Inside, the octagonal cenotaph-chamber contains the ceremonial marble
        coffins of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mumtaz-Mahal</ENAMEX> and also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shahjahan</ENAMEX>, while, as was the custom of
        that time, the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are entombed in another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> directly
        below. You‚Äôll need to light a candle or use a flashlight in the
        cenotaph-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> because daylight barely filters through the beautiful
        marble trellis-screens.
        Sadly, vandals removed all the tomb‚Äôs spectacular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treasures</ENAMEX>, but they did leave the gentle beauty of roses and poppies in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rich</ENAMEX> inlaid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> of onyx, green chrysolite, carnelian, and variegated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agate</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> is flanked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> almost identical red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>,
        to the west a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, to the east a guest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeach</ENAMEX> is a perfect
        viewing-point. Try the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> at sunrise and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>.
        But go around the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj</ENAMEX>, too, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> which overlooks
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yamuna</ENAMEX> river. This boasts a view as far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Agra Fort</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra Fort</ENAMEX>
        Built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1565</TIMEX>, a more embattled period than during
        Shahjahan‚Äôs construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red Fort</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Agra Fort</ENAMEX> was
        conceived as a citadel with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and a river on the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>. Pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> were a secondary consideration, and were in
        fact mostly additions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX>.
        The entrance from the south, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Amar Singh Gate</ENAMEX>, takes you
        up a ridged elephant‚Äôs ramp, sloped to slow down any potential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attackers</ENAMEX>. Pass into the long quadrangle of the pillared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diwan-i-Am</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Public Audience</ENAMEX>). It was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain William Hawkins</ENAMEX>
        handed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jahangir</ENAMEX> a special letter of introduction from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James I.</ENAMEX> Due north is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shahjahan‚Äôs Moti Masjid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearl Mosque</ENAMEX>). Climb the
        narrow staircase to the roof of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> for a fine view of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fort</ENAMEX>.
        Just off the northeast corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diwan-i-Am</ENAMEX>, the harem
        had its very own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nagina Masjid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, and between the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> a bazaar where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> sold silks and jewels. Near the hammam
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diwan-i-Khas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Private Audience</ENAMEX>) has rich carving
        and inlaid marble. The crack in the marble throne came from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cannonball</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1857</TIMEX>. As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi‚Äôs Fort</ENAMEX>, most of the private palace
        apartments face the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yamuna</ENAMEX> river. Among the most charming are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arcaded loggia</ENAMEX> and the gilt-roofed pavilions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Khas Mahal</ENAMEX> or
        Private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A minute</TIMEX> staircase led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musamman Burj</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pavilion</ENAMEX> of the emperor‚Äôs chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>. It is also popularly known as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúPrisoner‚Äôs Tower‚</ENAMEX>Äù for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aurangzeb</ENAMEX> imprisoned his father <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shahjahan</ENAMEX> here,
        allowing him a view of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jahangir</ENAMEX> is built around a square <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arches</ENAMEX>. There are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> motifs on the ceiling in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, and in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the west side: peacocks holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> in their beaks, for
        example.
        Other Sights
        On the river bank opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">fort</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb of</ENAMEX>
        Itimad-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ud-Daulah</ENAMEX>, overshadowed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>. This was built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years earlier</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jahangir‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nur Jahan</ENAMEX>, for her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, who served
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mughal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX>. There‚Äôs a fragile elegance to the white
        marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion‚Äôs graceful silhouette</ENAMEX>, with a cupola and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> octagonal
        turrets, and topped by domed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kiosks</ENAMEX>. The fine lattice-work on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arches</ENAMEX> and windows is superb, but its outstanding feature is the marble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inlay</ENAMEX>, which is even more abundant than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj</ENAMEX> and better
        preserved.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Akbar‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX>, located at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikandra</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">north of Agra</ENAMEX>. The best view is from the top of the gateway. On the
        cenotaph are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> names of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allah</ENAMEX>.
        Fatehpur Sikri
        In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> of crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, it makes a refreshing
        change to travel <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">37 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 miles</NUMEX>) southwest to an outcrop on which
        stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel of Fatehpur Sikri</ENAMEX>, briefly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar‚</ENAMEX>Äôs imperial
        capital.
        Fatehpur, planned as a capital with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX> as a fallback
        position in case of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attack</ENAMEX>, is protected on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by ramparts
        measuring <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 6 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>). On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> side is an artificial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake</ENAMEX> stretching <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rajasthan</ENAMEX> border, never
        sufficient, apparently, for the needs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel</ENAMEX>, and so one of the
        probable reasons why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akbar</ENAMEX> did not settle here permanently.
        Built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Agra Fort</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">citadel</ENAMEX> adds the darker red stone of the mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ridge</ENAMEX> to the usual
        pink sandstone.
        Entering via the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Agra Gate</ENAMEX>, at the northeast corner, one
        passes on the right the karkhanas (workshops) where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carpenters</ENAMEX>,
        weavers, and stonemasons worked.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diwan Khana-i-Am</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> used for public
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar</ENAMEX> dispensed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> while attended by an executioner
        with instruments of torture and death. The sight of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them was
        felt to be an effective means of getting at the truth. At the foot of
        the colonnade is a big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone tethering</ENAMEX>-ring for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> whose job
        it was to crush capital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> to death.
        Go through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daulat Khana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abode of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune</ENAMEX>) on the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of which the most
        striking feature is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> nature of its decoration: carved
        pedestals with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">stylized elephant</ENAMEX> heads as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX> and sculpted stone
        screens.
        In the southeast corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sultana‚Äôs House</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hujra-i-Anup Talao</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of the Peerless</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Pool</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> covering every wall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> and pillar create the illusion
        of woodwork rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatehpur</ENAMEX> is the subject of many colorful
        stories in which it isn‚Äôt possible to establish a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">historian‚Äôs ‚Äútruth</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        For instance, in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pachisi Court</ENAMEX>, a
        huge chessboard for the game of pachisi, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
        are said to have used human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúpieces‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX> each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave-girls</ENAMEX> in different costumes.
        Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar</ENAMEX> is said to have come to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astrologer‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pavilion</ENAMEX>, in the northwest corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>, for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> dose of
        forecasts from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>-esoteric. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> is known to have
        consulted a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astrology</ENAMEX>. Just behind this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Treasury Pavilion</ENAMEX>, where you can
        imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Akbar</ENAMEX> seated on cushions under the arches and counting the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial</ENAMEX> money. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ankh Michauli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blind Man‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buff</ENAMEX>), because it was where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akbar</ENAMEX> was thought to have played
        ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äúhide-and-seek‚</NUMEX>Äù with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>.
        The purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diwan-i-Khas</ENAMEX> is hotly disputed; it is
        not necessarily the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of private audience that its name implies. It
        is dominated by a great central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pillar</ENAMEX> supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> to a balcony.
        Some claim it was here that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akbar</ENAMEX> held his famous debates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX>,
        Brahmins, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parsi Zoroastrians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sufi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mystics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monks‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sages</ENAMEX> arguing while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akbar</ENAMEX> sat listening atop his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pillar</ENAMEX>, or
        Akbar striding majestically around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">balcony</ENAMEX> hurling his
        questions at his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">listeners</ENAMEX>. Others insist that it was just a storehouse
        for jewels. Truth in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, even more than beauty, is in the eye of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beholder</ENAMEX>.
        Walk across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> to the beautiful <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-tiered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Panch Mahal</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX> system of ventilation known as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">badgir</ENAMEX> (wind <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>): without walls on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX>, it is open for the
        breezes to sweep in. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> is supported on columns diminishing
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> at ground-level to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> on the roof. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> that no two columns
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floor</ENAMEX> are alike. Be careful on the steep climb to the
        top, but you‚Äôll find it is well worth it for the wonderful view across
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citadel</ENAMEX>, particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of the imperial harem to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southwest</ENAMEX>.
        The harem‚Äôs principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jodh Bai‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palace‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbuilt</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Akbar‚Äôs Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, the first royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> not
        required to convert to her husband‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">faith‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akbar‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        favorite residence at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatehpur</ENAMEX>. It has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side screening out the
        summer heat while the other is open to the cooler breezes. Its most
        cherished feature is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise ceramic tiled</ENAMEX> roof in the north and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">south</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatehpur‚Äôs Jama Masjid</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friday Mosque</ENAMEX>), at the south
        end of the citadel up on its mountain<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-ridge</ENAMEX>, was the very first of the
        open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>-style mosques to became characteristic of all Mughal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice the</ENAMEX> carved central mihrab (the recess marking the
        direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX>). The jewel of the red stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, however, is
        the marble-clad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaikh Salim Chishti</ENAMEX>. Its fa√ßade features black
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calligraphy</ENAMEX>; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cenotaph-chamber</ENAMEX> there are pretty painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>.
        Originally a more simple monument, its white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">marble ‚Äúskin‚Äù</ENAMEX> was the
        addition of a very grateful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jahangir</ENAMEX> who, without the mystic Shaikh
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salim Chishti</ENAMEX>, might never have seen the light of day.
        Bharatpur
        Strictly speaking, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bharatpur</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rajasthan</ENAMEX>, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proximity</ENAMEX>, just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26 miles</NUMEX>) due west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX>, makes it logical to
        include here. The marshes of the bird <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keoladeo-Ghana</ENAMEX> offer
        a welcome change of pace. Even if you‚Äôre not an avid <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watcher</ENAMEX>,
        you‚Äôll enjoy the gentle walks in the woodland, with the chance of
        seeing exciting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">herds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nilghai antelope</ENAMEX>, blackbuck, and cheetal
        (spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>). A good time to visit is just at the end of the monsoon
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">October‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇwhen you can see flocks of storks, egrets, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cormorants‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand it is ideally combined with a full-moon trip to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taj</ENAMEX>, but there‚Äôs plenty to see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round.
        Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300</NUMEX> different species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> here,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find eagles, cranes, pelicans, snakebirds, kingfishers, and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and geese, as well as a flock of rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wintering</ENAMEX> Siberian
        cranes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between January and March</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maharaja of Bharatpur</ENAMEX> used to
        organize formal annual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX>-shoots here for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> viceroys and other
        top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> as well as for fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princes</ENAMEX>. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> hunting is
        strictly banned. In other words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bharatpur</ENAMEX> is only for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corbett Park</ENAMEX>
        Among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs nature reserves, this is the best known
        because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Corbett</ENAMEX>, the audacious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>-eating tigers
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumaon</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1935</TIMEX> and was given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corbett‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        name after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> became independent.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>, this lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> of forest and meadows
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramganga</ENAMEX> river in the foothills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX> remains a home
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX>, leopard, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cheetah</ENAMEX>, sloth bear,
        wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX>, jackal, and hyena. The river abounds with mahseer and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX>,
        as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of crocodile and the occasional blind freshwater
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dolphin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> should look out for stork, red jungle-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fowl</ENAMEX>, and
        black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partridge</ENAMEX>.
        The forest is thick with sissoo and tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sal trees</ENAMEX>; their
        timber is prized for ship-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>-ride, which allows you
        to swing through the jungle and grassland while reclining on a
        cushioned howdah, is a great joy. Rest at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> in the lodge at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dhikala</ENAMEX> and watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> head down to the river.
        Be sure to plan ahead through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tourist Information</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, because admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> is by
        permit only. Permits are easy to obtain, however, and reserved
        accommodation can be booked either in the lodges or in the official
        campgrounds
        Chandigarh
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punjab</ENAMEX> is just a stopover en route to
        Simla, or a half-way point en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs well worth
        visiting this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, which was planned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1950</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Corbusier</ENAMEX>, invited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to create a new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for
        the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Partition Punjab</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">windy</ENAMEX> plain at the foot of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell Fry</ENAMEX> designing most of the
        housing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Corbusier</ENAMEX> created the leading public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and laid out
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevards</ENAMEX> and sweeping tree-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>, inspired
        at least in part by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lutyens‚</ENAMEX>Äô ideas for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX>, and blessedly
        uncongested by growing traffic. He planned the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on the principle of
        the human body, with the government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> and
        university at its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, the commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>-center at its heart, and
        the outlying industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> as its limbs.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Assembly</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secretariat</ENAMEX>
        administrative block, the vaulted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Court</ENAMEX>, and the smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Governor‚Äôs Residence</ENAMEX>, you can see huge slabs of concrete like weathered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> from the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> boast both geometric
        and amorphous shapes, with bright colors visible behind the sub-breaker
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grills</ENAMEX>. Take a walk through the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock Garden</ENAMEX> of large concrete
        blocks, or, to the east, take a rowboat on the artificial Sukhna
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake</ENAMEX>.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> visit the holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amritsar</ENAMEX> for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple Sikh Shrine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sikh</ENAMEX> architecture may also be appreciated at the
        nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Durgiana Temple</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jallianwala Bagh</ENAMEX> is an important monument to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyrs</ENAMEX> who dies in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amritsar</ENAMEX> massacre in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1919</TIMEX>.
        Simla
        Similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandigarh</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which is now capital of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Himachal Pradesh</ENAMEX>, was built back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years of the 19th century</TIMEX>
        when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> were desperately searching for
        refuge from the heat of the plains.
        At an altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,130 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6,755 ft</NUMEX>), this was once the
        place where a religious ascetic offered cool spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> to the
        numerous weary and thirsty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> coming out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>. Some
        of these trekkers were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> returning from the war with the
        Gurkhas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>. They came back to build mountain retreats, as
        well as regular little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cottages</ENAMEX> or perhaps an occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX>. From
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1832</TIMEX> onwards, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor-general</ENAMEX> Lord <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bentinck</ENAMEX> spent a happy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">summer</ENAMEX> here, it became the most prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">hill-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. The viceroys,
        including the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mountbatten</ENAMEX> (who pondered the last details of
        Independence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partition</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>), made it their summer
        capital.
        The old reasons to head for the hills still make a trip to
        Simla more than valid, even if the old viceregal glamour has gone. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">air</ENAMEX> here is sweet, cool, and clear, and the pleasure of the quaint and
        tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> village atmosphere remains, along with some lovely
        walks into the surrounding mountains. You should, however, acclimatize
        to the altitude before attempting any long hikes.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can retrace the favorite promenades
        along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mall</ENAMEX> and see the old administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ridge</ENAMEX>. The
        place at which these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> meet is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kipling</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚ÄúScandal Point</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        At the eastern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mall</ENAMEX> you can see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gaiety Theatre</ENAMEX>, one-time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Simla Amateur Dramatic Company</ENAMEX>, which is famous for its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">productions</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> drama and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edwardian</ENAMEX> operetta.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ridge</ENAMEX> leads past the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Neo-Gothic, Anglican Christ</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX>, where the bells are made from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> of cannons captured
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sikhs</ENAMEX>. At the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ridge</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find the baronial pile
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viceregal Lodge</ENAMEX>, nowadays used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for Advanced</ENAMEX>
        Studies. You can imagine rickshaws pulling up onto the grounds of the
        ivy-covered grey stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansion</ENAMEX> for one of the viceroy‚Äôs banquets. Peer
        into the grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, which has an elegant fireplace, a coffered
        ceiling, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">majestic staircase</ENAMEX>. Then continue to the top of Jakko
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX>, where you can see a fine view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and valley.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Kashmir</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vale</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,700 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,000 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level,
        has historically offered much-needed respite for conquerors and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> alike. Passing through the deserts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sind</ENAMEX> and the hot and
        dusty plains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganga valley</ENAMEX>, they have heard tell of its blessed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">meadows</ENAMEX>, forests, full fruit orchards, and lakes. It remains the
        undisputed treasure of the entire subcontinent. Unfortunately,
        continuing tensions between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> have
        rendered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kashmir</ENAMEX> a dangerous place for travellers.
        In accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. State Department‚Äôs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        Foreign Office‚Äôs travel advisories, as well as warnings issued by most
        other foreign consulates, we do not recommend <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kashmir</ENAMEX> as a tourist
        destination. The following information is provided only for the sake of
        background on the area.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the past, particularly during high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>,
        made <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kashmir</ENAMEX> the principal destination of their visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>,
        combining it with perhaps just brief outings and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>-trips in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agra</ENAMEX>. Those making more extensive tours of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, planned to see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kashmir</ENAMEX> at the end, with the intention of relaxing in a houseboat on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake</ENAMEX> or going on a refreshing hike in the lush surrounding
        mountains.
        Travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kashmir</ENAMEX> used to require bookings and
        preparations far in advance of visiting. But since the increase in
        eruptions of violence over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past ten years</TIMEX>, foreign travel to the
        region has greatly decreased. During <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Kashmir‚</ENAMEX>Äôs height of popularity as
        a tourist destination, one of the area‚Äôs most alluring features was the
        unique accommodation on houseboats. Travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> can reserve a
        houseboat for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX>, allowing travellers to change around
        once they‚Äôve fully settled in. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important and major advantage of
        advance reservations is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> will be met at the airport
        straight away by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the houseboat-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">owner‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit‚Äôs</ENAMEX> not
        easy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> to find their way among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>.
        Houseboats are a beautifully preserved tradition of the
        heyday of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Raj</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX> was the
        most exotic hill-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> of them all, the maharaja forbade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        to buy land there, so they then hit on the brilliant alternative of
        building luxuriously appointed houseboats moored on the lakes near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Srinagar</ENAMEX>. Equipped with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> upper-middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> comforts
        the colonials were used to, the more maneuverable, smaller houseboats
        made their way to other lakes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX>-shoots or just for the pleasures
        of the cruise, while the larger ones stayed languidly put.
        With so many new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> having been built in the same old
        style, boasting lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kashmiri</ENAMEX> carvings on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> and decks, many
        are too heavy to move around the waters. But the traditional comforts
        are the same: wood-burning stoves, plush armchairs in the living room,
        warm carpeting in the spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX>, superb personal service, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fine Kashmiri</ENAMEX> cuisine you can enjoy on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deck‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnote</ENAMEX> that you can arrange
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> what you want to eat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>, Western or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
        style.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">houseboats</ENAMEX> are moored on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dal Lake</ENAMEX>, but for those
        seeking seclusion, there are others on the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagin Lake</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">west</ENAMEX>. They are well serviced by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">shikaras‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgaily decorated</ENAMEX> and roofed
        canoes somewhat reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gondolas‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇplying</ENAMEX> their way
        around the lake, ferrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>. There is also a floating market
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. The shikaras will also show you carpets, silks,
        shawls, brassware, jewels, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carvings‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand tailors‚</ENAMEX>Äô establishments
        with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savile Roy</ENAMEX>, recalling their old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> allegiance.
        Srinagar
        Srinagar, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jammu</ENAMEX> and the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>, is still
        considered a dangerous place for foreign travellers. There is a strong
        military presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dusk-till-dawn</TIMEX> curfew is often in
        effect. The heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir‚Äôs</ENAMEX> capital is built along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">serpentine Jhelum</ENAMEX> river on the southern shore of the lakes. The many
        bazaars, busy tailor‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and government-operated emporiums are
        fascinating places to observe the style, panache, and never-ending gall
        of that charming and often shameless scoundrel, the Kashmiri
        merchant.
        Few monuments have survived <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kashmir‚</ENAMEX>Äôs troubled history,
        but the city‚Äôs beauty lies in its numerous tranquil lakes and gardens.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dal Lake</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adjoining Nagin</ENAMEX> offer leisurely cruises, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers lounging</ENAMEX> on the cushions of a shikara. Lovely floating
        gardens growing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>, cucumbers, and lotus root in a mesh
        of reeds and mud floating in the water and moored in squares by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">poles</ENAMEX> stuck in the lake bed, add to the tranquil beauty of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake</ENAMEX>.
        On the western shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dal Lake</ENAMEX>, is the large white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>
        and minarets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazratbal Mosque</ENAMEX>, famous for its relic, the hair of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beard of the prophet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX>.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small squares of land that rise up out of

        long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> wide (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">82 by 25 miles</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mughal Gardens</ENAMEX> are on the eastern shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dal Lake</ENAMEX>.
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jahangir</ENAMEX>, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX> idea of paradise had any meaning, it was
        here, amid the staggered terraces, tranquil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, waterfalls, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, looking out over the lake against the backdrop of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, there‚Äôs a sound-and-light show at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jahangir‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shalimar Bagh</ENAMEX>, laid out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1616</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> are able to relax
        here as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> did, by lingering on the terraces to take in the
        changing scene that surround them. The white marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> on the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> was used for public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> was a private

        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) to the south, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishat Bagh</ENAMEX> was laid out

        Tucked away in a small fold of the hills is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chashma Shahi</ENAMEX>,
        the smallest but in many ways most exquisite of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughal Gardens</ENAMEX>,
        drawing its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> that runs directly down the adjacent

        Excursions from Srinagar
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pahalgam</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 95 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>) east of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Srinagar</ENAMEX>. The route there runs through groves of willow, used for the
        local <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">cricket</ENAMEX>-bat industry, and fields of saffron. If you‚Äôve ever
        wondered why saffron is so expensive, it‚Äôs because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150,000</NUMEX> of these
        purple or white crocuses (only the stamen is orange) are necessary to
        make up a single kilogram (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 pounds</NUMEX>) of saffron proper, the stuff that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flavors</ENAMEX> and colors those famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paella</ENAMEX>.
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> is the only other place in the world apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX> where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saffron</ENAMEX> is grown extensively. )
        The most popular journey from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pahalgam</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">27 miles</NUMEX>)
        up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Amarnath Cave</ENAMEX>, which has an altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 3,895</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,742</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>). Sacred to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hindus</ENAMEX>, it is a destination of devout pilgrimage on
        festive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> for the sight of the imposing stalagmite called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shiva‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lingam</ENAMEX>; this phallic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> stands for the god‚Äôs fertility, power, and
        creativity. Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pahalgam</ENAMEX>, one trek, the most
        strenuous by far, leads to the spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kolahoi Glacier</ENAMEX>.
        Gulmarg, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">52 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 miles</NUMEX>) west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Srinagar</ENAMEX>, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2,653</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8,622 ft</NUMEX>) above sea level. It is currently developing its winter

        wonderful hiking here, too, through pine forests and meadows carpeted
        with wildflowers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">WEST</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> is, above all, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rajasthan</ENAMEX>, land of the great
        maharajas, with its desert and lake <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, but it‚Äôs also the bustle
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mumbai</ENAMEX> and the splendor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cave temples</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajanta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellora</ENAMEX>.
        There is also the great bonus, further down the coast, of the stunning
        beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goa</ENAMEX>.
        Introducing Rajasthan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajasthan</ENAMEX> is undoubtedly one of the most romantic regions
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. Known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajputana</ENAMEX>, and stretching from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pakistani Sind</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punjab</ENAMEX>, this land is where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rajput warriors</ENAMEX>
        erected their desert and mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">redoubts</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>-fortresses were
        built with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> from the surrounding hills, and with the same
        dazzling marble used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX>.
        The great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaisalmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jodhpur</ENAMEX> are on the
        ancient caravan routes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indus Valley</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thar Desert</ENAMEX>, for
        this is a land of cattle-herders too. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of their most spectacular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">monuments</ENAMEX> is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">market-festival</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pushkar</ENAMEX> held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">209</NUMEX>).
        Probably descendants of the invading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scythians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huns</ENAMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajputs</ENAMEX> were a formidable opposition met by the waves of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">invaders‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇTurks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghans</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughals</ENAMEX>. Despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rajputs‚Äô ‚Äúforeign‚</ENAMEX>Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">origin</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">claimed ‚Äúdescendancy‚Äù</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aryan</ENAMEX> dynasties of the sun
        and moon was accepted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahman</ENAMEX> priesthood and they were duly
        inducted retroactively into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kshatriya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior caste</ENAMEX>, a caste to
        which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajputs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> continue proudly to belong .
        While the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malwa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gujarat</ENAMEX> came under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> rule,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajputana</ENAMEX> remained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX>. Towns with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">suffix -pur</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>;
        -abad is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> suffix. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rajput</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princes</ENAMEX> pursued an independent
        line. Others sent their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> to the harem or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> to serve
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in the imperial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>. They enjoyed a privileged position
        during the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Raj</ENAMEX>.
        Jaipur
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajasthan</ENAMEX> was built according to
        astrological precepts. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raja Jai Singh II</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholar</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> who
        dotted northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> with his collections of instruments for observing
        the heavens, chose an exact date for moving his capital from <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Amber‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ17
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1727‚ÄÇ‚</TIMEX>Äî‚ÄÇas auspicious. He then laid it out according to the
        disposition of the stars and planets.
        But let‚Äôs begin at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amber</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of
        Jaipur, high up on a hill commanding a gorge, which offered military
        advantage but was not right for the expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> he wanted for his
        capital.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amber</ENAMEX> takes you through classical
        Rajasthani landscape, its parched hills embracing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Maota</ENAMEX>, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water buffalo snooze lazily</ENAMEX> in the sun. You may also pass an occasional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">camel</ENAMEX>, that time-honored vehicle of transport known as the ‚Äúship of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">desert</ENAMEX>,‚Äù hauling his load on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart fitted</ENAMEX> with discarded tires from an
        airplane.
        At the fortress, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Rajputs of Jai Singh‚Äôs Kachwaha clan</ENAMEX>
        slowed down their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> with a steep elephant ramp. You can travel by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> up through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suraj Pol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Gate</ENAMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaleb Chauk</ENAMEX>, a
        garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard swarming</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">langur monkeys</ENAMEX> and surrounded by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant stables</ENAMEX>.
        A staircase zigzags its way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Kali</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX>), built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX>. The silver doors have
        bas-relief panels depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kali</ENAMEX> riding various <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Her statue was
        brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bengal</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kali</ENAMEX> is particularly strong. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX> is a subtle example of the maharajas‚Äô opulence: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> banished
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aurangzeb</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>) worked on the columns and arches,
        and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building‚Äôs gallery</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diwan-i-Am</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Public</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Audience</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Diwan-i-Khas</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Private Audience Chamber</ENAMEX>), known as
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Shish Mahal</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace of Mirrors</ENAMEX>), features the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajputs‚</ENAMEX>Äô flamboyant
        taste for covering walls with green, orange, and purple glass, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vaulted</ENAMEX> ceilings with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of little convex mirrors. Strike a
        match to see the effect.
        The most inviting place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sukh</ENAMEX> Niwas
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> of pleasure), with doors inlaid in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX> and sandalwood. Inside,
        cool <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was brought down from the roof through a carved white marble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chute</ENAMEX>, and fresh air was brought in through the finely chiselled
        lattice stonework. The color of its sandstone has earned for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaipur</ENAMEX> the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">name ‚Äúpink city‚Äù‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇalthough you will see that it changes color with the
        season and time of day, from a rosy pink to warmest amber, bright
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orange</ENAMEX>, and dull ochre.
        Appropriate for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendant</ENAMEX> of the sun dynasty, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jai Singh</ENAMEX>
        laid out the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on an axis from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suraj Pol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Gate</ENAMEX>) in the east
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chand Pol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Moon Gate</ENAMEX>) in the west, a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a
        lively bazaar.
        The town‚Äôs central focus was the most elaborate Jantar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mantar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX>, which was the final fruit of his labors and begun
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>). The initiated will appreciate the significance,
        others the mysterious atmosphere of its <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX>-colored gnomons (the
        uprights of sundials), quadrants, and sextants.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandra Mahal</ENAMEX>, directly south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX>, is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> mystically planned courtyards and stories. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> gives intriguing insight into the life and
        heyday of the maharajas: their rich costumes, their scimitars, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles inlaid</ENAMEX> with bright jewels and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> a horrible bludgeon
        with a double serrated edge.
        Overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hawa Mahal</ENAMEX>, literally the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wind Palace</ENAMEX>, but actually a rather grand, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-storied royal box, in
        which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> could sit and watch festive processions. Its airy,
        projecting oriel-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> are seen as a symbolic image of
        Jaipur style. There‚Äôs a fine view from the top of the zigzag
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staircase</ENAMEX>.
        Jodhpur
        Of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajasthan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fortifications, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jodhpur‚Äôs Fort</ENAMEX>, perched
        high on its sheer cliffs at the eastern edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thar Desert</ENAMEX>, must
        surely rank among the most imposing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rathor Rajputs</ENAMEX>, always a
        belligerent bunch and bad trouble for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajputs</ENAMEX>,
        built it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar</ENAMEX> decided it was better to have them
        on his side than to try to convert them; when he married the Maharaja
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jodhpur‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jodh Bai</ENAMEX> (for whom he built a grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatehpur Sikri</ENAMEX>; see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>) there was no question of converting her to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>.
        Near the east gate, you‚Äôll see tombstones where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>
        died defending the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, and cannonball scars indicating efforts by
        Maharaja of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaipur</ENAMEX> to snatch a promised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Princess</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishna Kumari</ENAMEX>,
        against her will; she took her own life during the battle. On top of
        the ramparts the fort displays its proudest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX>: a set of
        fierce-looking howitzers and a few cannons. From here there is a fine
        view of the blue-and-whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
        Behind the ramparts and the gates with sharp iron spikes
        to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> from ramming them, there is a very handsome
        residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>. Its majesty is most notable in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Harem</ENAMEX>, which have screens of the most delicate latticework. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> displays a colorful collection of exhibits, giving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insight</ENAMEX> into the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life of those who lived there. There are
        luxuriously <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">embroidered elephant</ENAMEX> howdahs as well as babies‚Äô cradles and
        ladies‚Äô palanquins. A version of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX>-chair, palanquins were either
        completely closed up so that a promised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bride</ENAMEX> was invisible while
        inside, or constructed with a peep hole to allow her to see out‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand
        be seen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">for‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhen</ENAMEX> she was married.
        At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Iron Gate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll see a more poignant side of
        the life of a maharaja‚Äôs wife‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet sati</ENAMEX> handprints on the wall,
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widows</ENAMEX> who threw themselves onto their husbands‚Äô funeral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pyres</ENAMEX> in
        ritual sacrifice, in keeping with the tradition of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>.
        In the bustling old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jodhpur</ENAMEX> itself, you can‚Äôt
        and shouldn‚Äôt miss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saddar</ENAMEX> Market situated by the old clock-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>.
        Any one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barbers</ENAMEX> will be happy to give you a shave and a
        haircut under the banyan <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tree‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> get a good deal of local

        up in multi-colored mountains; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> chant as they measure out
        separate lots of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five kilos</NUMEX> each: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúthree</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äù ‚Äúfour</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>,

        Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) due north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jodhpur</ENAMEX>, the maharajas‚Äô
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mausoleum</ENAMEX> is in a pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on the site of the old capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mandor</ENAMEX>.
        Watched over by crows, pigeons, and parakeets‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand some rare <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>,
        which will doubtlessly be of interest only to ornithologists‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare a
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>-like memorials built on the site of the maharajas‚Äô
        funeral pyres, and a colonnade of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> god-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>.
        If you‚Äôre going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jaisalmer</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs well worth a
        detour to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osian</ENAMEX> to see the stunning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jain</ENAMEX> temples, many of
        them dating as far back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX>. Somehow this ancient
        sculpted pantheon of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jain</ENAMEX> prophets has survived the
        sometimes ferocious weather of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahmud of Ghazni‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iconoclasts</ENAMEX>.
        Back on the road to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaisalmer</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last splash of color
        delights the senses before you plunge into the desert: the fields are
        dotted with mounds of ‚ÄÇred hot chili peppers.
        Jaisalmer
        Situated on the route of the ancient caravans that brought
        goods from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Asia</ENAMEX>, the sandstone citadel of
        Jaisalmer, protected by an imposing double set of bastions, rises like
        a mirage from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thar Desert</ENAMEX>.
        Jaisalmer, founded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maharawals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1156</TIMEX>, is the
        oldest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajasthan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. Though much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has
        grown up outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fort‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmodern</ENAMEX> in time, but not in style‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ÄÇ3,000</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live within its walls. Some of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
        are from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>. The best view of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">citadel</ENAMEX> can be
        had from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaisal Castle Hotel</ENAMEX>.
        The elaborate sculpture in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jain</ENAMEX> temples
        within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">fort</ENAMEX> finds its counterpart in the finely carved fa√ßades of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merchants‚Äô Havelis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX>), built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years later</TIMEX>, and sheltered
        from sandstorms on the northeast side. But much more than the
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">monuments‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhandsome</ENAMEX> but hardly grandiose, because of the
        restricted spaces <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">available‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit</ENAMEX> is the general atmosphere of the town
        that gives it its special magic. Everything here is bathed in a serene
        desert light that adds a shimmer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> and a translucence to the
        shadows. To see the desert at its best, go out at dawn and at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sunset</ENAMEX>.
        Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jaisalmer</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find the road peters out at the
        village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> and the forbidden area of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> military installations
        on the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. On the way to the village you‚Äôll come
        across a ‚Äúcamel-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>,‚Äù from where you may wish to take a ride. For
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> of this quaint form of transport, longer camel safaris can be set
        up through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jaisalmer</ENAMEX> travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camel driver</ENAMEX> to direct
        you to the still uncharted village of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kuldhara‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇuncharted</ENAMEX> because it
        was one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> abandoned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 160 years ago</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paliwal Brahmins</ENAMEX>, who, after living there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, left suddenly
        during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>, rather than having to face paying the new, arbitrary
        land-tax. It still stands as a ghost <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">town‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgroups</ENAMEX> of dilapidated
        square <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> made from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sandstone‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> is visited nowadays only by the
        occasional goatherd, who will play you a tune on his flute in
        traditional style.
        Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mool Sagar</ENAMEX> gardens are a
        popular place for picnics in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rainy season</TIMEX>. There are pretty arbors
        and a monsoon <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX>, but it is in fact pleasant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round.
        Udaipur
        If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaisalmer</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of the desert, then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Udaipuri</ENAMEX> is
        is its opposite: the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of lakes and gardens. The lakes were created
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maharana Udai Singh</ENAMEX> for his new capital by damming up the Berach
        river after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akbar</ENAMEX> had ransacked his mountain redoubt at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chittorgarh</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maharanas of Udaipur</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> in and around
        Udaipur: the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Palace</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter quarters</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagniwas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pichola</ENAMEX> used as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> palace (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Palace Hotel</ENAMEX>); the Jag
        Mandir on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pichola</ENAMEX>, used for festivals; the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lakshmi Vilas Palace</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> beside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake Fateh Sagar</ENAMEX>; and a monsoon palace up in the Aravalli
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX>. It was the marble used for them that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shahjahan</ENAMEX> chose for his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahal</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Pichola</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) wide
        is the largest. Cruises are available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhansi Ghat</ENAMEX>, which is
        near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Palace</ENAMEX>. This will enable you to travel out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palace Hotel</ENAMEX>, even if you‚Äôre not staying there. The southern end of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pichola</ENAMEX> has the best view of the lake, taking in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>-palaces
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Palace</ENAMEX> beyond.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Palace</ENAMEX> on the east shore of the lake
        is now part royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, part luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, and part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX> symbol of the maharana is everywhere, worshiped during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monsoons</TIMEX>.
        The armor displayed here includes an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">disguising horses</ENAMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">frescoes</ENAMEX> illustrate the tragic story of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Princess</ENAMEX>
        Krishna‚Äôs suicide at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jodhpur</ENAMEX>. Glass baubles, some as big as golf balls,
        have replaced real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jewels</ENAMEX> in the mosaics.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of the City Palace</ENAMEX> is the handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagdish Temple</ENAMEX>, a
        rare example of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indo-Aryan</ENAMEX> style and symbol of its independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spirit</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bharatiya Lokkala Mandal Folk Museum</ENAMEX> has an excellent display of
        Rajasthani art, which includes bright puppets, costumes, and the whole
        range of turbans worn by the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajput</ENAMEX> clans. A modest puppet show
        is put on every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 to 25 minutes</TIMEX> in the puppet theater.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fateh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sagar Lake</ENAMEX> is reached by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> at the north end of
        Pichola, but you can also get there by a pleasant drive past the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gardens</ENAMEX> of bougainvillaea and lilac of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lakshmi Vilas Palace</ENAMEX>.
        You can visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gardens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saheliyon-ki-Bari</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maids of</ENAMEX>
        Honor), where the maharana kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX> presented to him by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>. The gardens here are famous for their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
        fountains that imitate the many different sounds of the monsoon, from
        light showers to torrential storms.
        Chittorgarh, a fortress, was the site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajputs‚</ENAMEX>Äô many
        acts of sacrifice. Making the trip by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> or rail from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Udaipur</ENAMEX>, it is
        on a plateau <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 150 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">487 ft</ENAMEX>) in height up in the Aravalli
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX>.
        Entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwestern</ENAMEX> side, you can go through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gateways</ENAMEX> to see the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajput‚</ENAMEX>Äôs heroic exploits. Stones
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mark</ENAMEX> where each of these brave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> fell in battle.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Gate</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palace of Kumbha</ENAMEX>,
        is built over the cave where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padmini</ENAMEX> led the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> jauhar and to which
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajputs‚</ENAMEX>Äô descendants return for an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> celebration. Some of the
        walls in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> were built with pieces of stone removed from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> temples.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kumbha‚Äôs Jaya Stambha</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower of Victory</ENAMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">37 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>) high, was built to celebrate his great victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmud</ENAMEX>
        Khalji of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malwa</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1440</TIMEX>. The tower‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> stories are decorated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deities</ENAMEX>, but otherwise it seems inspired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirti Stambha</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Jain Tower of Fame</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>.
        At the southern end, beside a pond with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">middle</ENAMEX>, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padmini‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">princess</ENAMEX> is said to have passed
        her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last days</TIMEX>. It is unlikely that the mirror in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> overlooking
        the pond was the very one in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX> got his fatal peek at
        her, but the guides tell the story this way to make it more enticing
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
        Ranakpur
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">mountains</ENAMEX> are especially sanctified in the cult
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jainism</ENAMEX>. In fact, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aravalli Hills</ENAMEX>, situated in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southwestern</ENAMEX> part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajasthan</ENAMEX>, you will find one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jains‚</ENAMEX>Äô leading
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sanctuaries</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Udaipur</ENAMEX>, a mountain road takes you past green
        terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> and mango groves over the deepest ravines to the
        magnificent white marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temple complex</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ranakpur</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaumukha Temple</ENAMEX> is known nowadays as the quadruple temple
        because of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> within a complex of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domed shrines</ENAMEX>,
        each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> topped by a flag with tinkling bells attached‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpaying musical
        homage to the many deities worshiped inside. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1438</TIMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaumukha</ENAMEX> is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adinath, Jainism‚</ENAMEX>Äôs original <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX> Tirthankaras
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>), whose truths were revealed by the prophet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahavira</ENAMEX> (see
        page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>).
        As with all the holy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jainism</ENAMEX>, you must remove
        not only your shoes but any leather you may be wearing. Walking through
        the entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hall‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwhich</ENAMEX> is decorated with a number of sensual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sculptures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-moon threshold, you penetrate a forest
        of symmetrical pillars, each subtly different in its intricate carving.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temple‚</ENAMEX>Äôs rich carvings attest to the wealth of the
        Jain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchant</ENAMEX> who commissioned it. You can find a sculpture of him in a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pillars</ENAMEX>, second pillar from the left. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deepa</ENAMEX>, is also
        here, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third row</TIMEX> of pillars, first pillar on the right.
        Restoration work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is, amazingly, carried out by the 14th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deepa‚</ENAMEX>Äôs direct descendants. You can climb up to the roof
        for a fascinating perspective of the flags, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> surrounded
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aravalli Hills</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dilwara Temples</ENAMEX> are located on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Abu</ENAMEX>, in a former
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hill</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> (now used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bourgeoisie</ENAMEX>). If
        you go‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand the temples are well worth it‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇyou would do best to take
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jaipur</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahmedabad</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajanta</ENAMEX> and Ellora
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cave temples hewn</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> of the Vindhya
        mountains in the northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deccan</ENAMEX> are among the great wonders of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. They are considered masterpieces, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúcaves‚Äù</ENAMEX> are
        actually man-made hollows in solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, from which a complex of
        architecturally elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> and monasteries has been carved with
        simple instruments. Even beyond this tour de force, the rock-cut
        sanctuaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajanta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellora</ENAMEX> are superb works of art, boast ing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensuous</ENAMEX> painting and expressive sculpture of the highest order.
        Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> are within easy reach of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aurangabad</ENAMEX>. Try not to visit both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX>. If you are
        interested in following the historical evolution of the temples, stop
        off at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajanta</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, where some caves are from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> b.c.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Ellora</ENAMEX> for a tour during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX>, when the caves will be

        Having remained untouched for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years</TIMEX>, until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> discovered it during a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger hunt</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1819</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajanta</ENAMEX> has the
        advantage over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ellora</ENAMEX>, whose caves were in constant use as dwelling
        places. The use of rock-cut sanctuaries goes back to the time of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Ashoka</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. , when itinerant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monks</ENAMEX> formed a religious order and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> provided them with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">rock</ENAMEX>-hewn cells as a vihara (retreat) during the monsoons. The monks
        added a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> for worship called a chaitya (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>).
        Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> caves, all of them <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> are chaitya
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX> and the rest vihara monasteries. They are cut from a
        horseshoe-shaped cliff standing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">75 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">252 ft</ENAMEX>) high above a narrow
        gorge, which has a small stream running through it. Originally, each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vihara</ENAMEX> had its own stairway down to the stream. The caves have been
        numbered from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 to 29</TIMEX>, west to east. Experiencing just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of them
        will give an impression of the whole. Start in the middle, at the
        oldest, then work your way east before returning to the historically
        later caves at the western entrance.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cave 10</ENAMEX> is probably the oldest of the chaitya temples,
        dated at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 150</NUMEX> b.c. Its nave and aisles are divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> octagonal
        pillars leading to a stupa, the domed focus of veneration, with an apse
        beyond, permitting the circumambulation. There is no representation of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> in this early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cave 9</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> b.c. , is
        smaller than number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. It is dominated by the stupa. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story
        fa√ßade with arched window and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> figures in side niches was
        probably added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> a.d.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> in a kneeling position welcome you to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>, one of the most important of the later caves, created between a.d.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">475</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">a.d. 600</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahayana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX> encouraged worship of
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> image, which is why the stupa was replaced with a sculpture of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> sitting in a posture used traditionally for teaching. Look for
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sculptures of amorous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> on the ceiling.
        With the richness and vigor of its mural paintings, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> represents the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajanta‚</ENAMEX>Äôs artistry. The walls, from the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> a.d. , show the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> stories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs enlightenment.
        Buddha‚Äôs steadfast resistance to temptation gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> of that
        time a splendid pretext to show the sensual side of court life as a
        foil to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master‚</ENAMEX>Äôs spirituality. We see him taming an enraged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> or appearing as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simhala</ENAMEX> attacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Island</ENAMEX> of
        Ogresses, while his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rani</ENAMEX>, holding a mirror, languorously prepares
        her toilet with handmaidens holding her cosmetics.
        The sculpted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> is seen with the wheel, symbolic of
        his law, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarnath</ENAMEX> where he held
        his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sermon. Look for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> smaller figures on the pedestal, one of
        which is holding a bowl for alms or offerings‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthey represent the rich
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> who financed the cave‚Äôs construction.
        The small chaitya of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cave 19</ENAMEX> is notable for the carved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> statues in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX> and for the graceful figures
        relaxing in the side niches at the entrance. Visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cave 26</ENAMEX> for a riot

        Unlike the early, rather austere monasteries, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caves 1</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are richly ornamented. There are superb murals of bright-eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>,
        peacocks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>, and also those depicting the opulent
        life, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siddhartha</ENAMEX> riding away on horseback. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masterpieces</ENAMEX>, though, are in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Cave 1</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodhisattvas</ENAMEX> on the
        back wall on either side of the antechamber.
        The caves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellora</ENAMEX> are cut out of a whole hillside of
        basalt rock, and conceived on a much grander scale than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajanta‚Äôs.</ENAMEX> Local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">villagers</ENAMEX> have relied on them as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> during monsoons or epidemics,
        so the murals have disappeared, but the magnificent sculpture has
        survived. Starting where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ajanta</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">off‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsome</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>
        may well have moved over to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ellora‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ all of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> caves were created
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the seventh and 12th centuries</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
        are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX>, and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jain</ENAMEX>. They stretch north‚Äìsouth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>), allowing you the option of climbing behind some of them
        as well as approaching from the cave entrance.
        The most important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> excavation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1‚Äì12</ENAMEX>) is the only
        chaitya <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> here, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cave 10</ENAMEX> with its fine
        rib-vaulted ceiling reminiscent of a western <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Romanesque cathedral</ENAMEX>. The
        great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> seated in the domed stupa is worshiped by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> artisans
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Visvakarma</ENAMEX>, carpenter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> is known as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúCave of the Carpenters</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cave</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> consists of a vihara <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dormitory</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stories.
        Its sensual, feminine sculptures show significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tantric Hindu</ENAMEX>
        influence. You must imagine these as they were originally painted, in
        brilliant colors.
        Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">13‚Äì29</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave 14</ENAMEX> is an interesting
        transition from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> caves, because in the pantheon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vishnu</ENAMEX> sits in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">meditative</ENAMEX> pose, suggesting he was converted
        from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodhisattvas of Ajanta</ENAMEX>.
        The sculpture shows a dynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shiva</ENAMEX> killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">demons</ENAMEX> and playing dice in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>, a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> playing with the sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bull</ENAMEX>, and mother
        goddesses with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        The masterpiece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ellora</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kailasa Temple of Cave</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>. With a ground plan the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Parthenon</ENAMEX> and a structure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as tall again, this was the work of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Deccan</ENAMEX> king
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishna I.</ENAMEX> In the process of shaping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> in an
        area <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">82 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">265 ft</ENAMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 47</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150 ft</ENAMEX>) wide, leaving the back
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúwall‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> ft) high, an amazing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200,000 tons</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rock</ENAMEX> were cut away from the face of the hill. Whatever was saved in
        hauling the masonry needed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúerect‚Äù such an edifice was more than
        counter-balanced by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> who completed
        their amazing carvings from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>. The anonymous sculptors
        created a panoply of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tradition‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇlegendary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> and their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">battles</ENAMEX>, hunts, and weddings.
        The result is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on a grand scale which can be
        easily compared with its inspiration: the many temples of Mahabalipuram
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">194</NUMEX>), built <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 50 years before</TIMEX> in the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>. The
        huge gateway leads to the mandapa worship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, with the tall pyramid
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> beyond, the whole structure symbolizing the mythical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Meru</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Himalayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>.
        After seeing the sculpted friezes at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> level, you
        can gain yet another perspective of the temple‚Äôs fine detail from
        above, by walking along the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone ledge</ENAMEX> that leads around the top. Do
        wear good shoes and use the safety railing.
        After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kailasa</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jain</ENAMEX> caves (numbers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30‚Äì34</NUMEX>), excavated
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the eighth and 13th centuries</TIMEX>, will come as an
        anti-climax‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand this despite the considerable prowess of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sculptors</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cave</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> tries to emulate the style of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> on a much smaller scale, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> here were working on
        much harder rock and so abandoned their effort. The most interesting of
        all remains the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cave 32</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indra Sabha</ENAMEX>, notable for
        the upper floor‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Äôs extravagant carving‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> hallmark of Jain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sculptors‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand the great stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>, more rigid than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kailasa‚Äôs‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX>(because of the tougher stone), but somehow more noble.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äú Gateway of India‚Äù</ENAMEX> still describes the main function of

        An occasional luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">liner</ENAMEX> still glides past the great

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> to dock at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballard Pier</ENAMEX>. For the rest of us landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santacruz</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Airport</ENAMEX>, the old turmoil of dockside porters and rickshaws that once
        submerged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newcomer</ENAMEX> has been replaced by the equally crazy bustle of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> going to and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>. With skyscrapers

        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> carrying bricks on their heads to build luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, and
        sackcloth hovels on construction sites.
        For anyone who is not here on business, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>, at

        the most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-imperialist</ENAMEX> may be touched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral</ENAMEX>, by some of
        the poignant epitaphs for those who died in the military or civil
        service for their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. For big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Raj-buffs</ENAMEX>, the supreme example of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest of the VT</ENAMEX> is the bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crawford Market</ENAMEX> (known

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians‚Äô Mumbai</ENAMEX> is also epitomized by the promenade of

        Instead of flying down, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> prefer to take the
        more leisurely steamer from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mumbai</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embarkation</ENAMEX> takes place at the

        After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasco da Gama</ENAMEX> landed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malabar Coast</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1498</TIMEX>,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portuguese</ENAMEX> invaded the area and seized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goa</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bijapur</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1510</TIMEX>. They held the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 450 years</TIMEX>,
        until finally Nehru l aunched an attack and drove them out.
        Goa was a vital link for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Portugal‚Äôs</ENAMEX> colonial trade in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX>. It also became a prime base for missionary activity, with

        manage to tear yourself away from the paradisiacal beaches, which are
        so inviting.
        The most popular beaches of all are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calangute</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dona</ENAMEX>
        Paula, each of them within reach of the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panaji</ENAMEX>, and easy

        the most secluded and unspoiled white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sands</ENAMEX> can be found along the

        have been beautifully restored, but you will doubtlessly notice that
        without the town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that used to surround them, they have
        acquired the strangely melancholic air of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>-pieces. The town
        once had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350,000 and some 100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. Nowadays the
        laterite stonework of many of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thoughtfully</ENAMEX> and carefully covered with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lime plaster</ENAMEX> to protect them
        against deterioration from the heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of the dreaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monsoons</ENAMEX>.
        Distinguished from others by the harmonious simplicity of
        its rib-vaulted nave, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis of Assisi</ENAMEX> is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> still
        standing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Velha Goa</ENAMEX>, perhaps dating as far back as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1521</TIMEX>. The fine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arabesque</ENAMEX> and floral frescoes are the work of local <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> who
        excelled at the themes wholly familiar to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">them‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthis</ENAMEX> in contrast with
        their efforts to paint portraits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, with whose images they
        were, despite the hard work of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX>, perhaps not as much at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuscan Renaissance</ENAMEX> fa√ßade of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">S√© Cathedral</ENAMEX>, the single
        biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, has a certain elegance to it,
        despite a loss of symmetry when its north <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1776</TIMEX>. The
        enormous main altar, which is dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>,
        shows some scenes from the saint‚Äôs martyrdom in a series of sumptuously

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandstone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> were the materials used to build the

        Xavier‚Äôs relics in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> to the right of the altar. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mausoleum</ENAMEX> was designed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, as a gift from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Grand Duke</ENAMEX> of

        ever-present.

        As a logical stopover on your way to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Varanasi</ENAMEX> (coming from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcutta</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucknow</ENAMEX> is worth a visit for its special place

        On a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> surrounded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, a cenotaph pays
        tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief Commissioner</ENAMEX> Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Lawrence</ENAMEX>, who was killed during

        Varanasi
        One thing is certain: you cannot begin to fathom the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mystery of India</ENAMEX> without a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi</ENAMEX>. Not that this old city
        will <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúexplain‚Äù everything‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇin fact, its dramatic confrontations of
        life and death on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganga river</ENAMEX>, and of scholarship and superstition,
        may only mystify you even further‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbut the city‚Äôs aura of sanctity is
        so overwhelming that it supercedes any need for rational explanations.
        Perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> conquerors once perceived the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus‚</ENAMEX>Äô reverence for
        Varanasi as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">threat‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthere</ENAMEX> is no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this 3,000-year-old</TIMEX> city

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muhammadabad</ENAMEX>.
        The name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Varanasi</ENAMEX>, misheard by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benares</ENAMEX>, is
        derived from its site between the tributaries of the life-giving holy
        river <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ganga, the Varuna and the Asi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX> is said to have poured the
        river down on the plains from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>; this mythical story leads
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus</ENAMEX> to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi</ENAMEX> is the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the world.
        Probably founded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indo-Aryans</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> b.c. , the
        city was established from earliest times as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">famous</ENAMEX> seat of learning

        remained ever since a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu sciences</ENAMEX>. It was just outside
        Varanasi that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX> gathered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> b.c. to
        hear his sermon at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Deer Park</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarnath</ENAMEX>. Since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jain</ENAMEX> monks,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sikhs</ENAMEX> have proclaimed it a holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, building
        monasteries, mosques, and temples here.
        The Ghats
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>-stepped embankments leading down to the Ganga
        river are the gathering place of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 250,000 pilgrims</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. To
        see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> unfold at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghats</ENAMEX>, you must rise before dawn to join the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pilgrims</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are up and about, busily chanting ‚ÄúGanga
        Mai ki jai! <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äù‚ÄÇ ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚</ENAMEX>ÄúPraise be to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX> Ganga! ‚Äù
        Some are sannyasi, wandering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">beggars</ENAMEX> who have abandoned
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and walked from as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chennai</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madras</ENAMEX>) to stand on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghats</ENAMEX> and pray, to bathe and drink the waters of the holy river, or
        just to sit and meditate on this supreme moment of their religious
        lives. Even the most aged and infirm travel here to die, for nothing is
        more blessed for a devout <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> than to die in the great <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi</ENAMEX> and thus be released from the eternal cycle of rebirth.
        Practically all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> in town lead down to the Dasaswamedh
        Ghat, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahma the Creator</ENAMEX> is said to have made a ritual sacrifice
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> horses. At the top of the steps, holy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> sit under their bamboo
        umbrellas chanting mantras and offering, for a coin or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>,
        either sandalwood paste, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ganga</ENAMEX>.
        At the water‚Äôs edge, you can rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and go into
        midstream for a view of the impressive skyline, which features many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>, gopuram <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> minarets, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mughal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>. In
        the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) between her tributaries, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ganga</ENAMEX> inscribes a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crescent</ENAMEX>, turning north, as it is suggested, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last gesture of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">farewell</ENAMEX> to her sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX> before descending east
        towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay of Bengal</ENAMEX>. You can ask your boatman to take you further
        upstream to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asi Ghat</ENAMEX> before doubling back as far as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panchganga</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how the ritual ablutions, which are highly
        elaborate when performed by a learned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahman</ENAMEX>, usually involve a kind
        of crouching movement completed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> times in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX>, you will notice, bathe in full sari. You‚Äôll see plenty of soap
        and shampoo and, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dhobi Ghat</ENAMEX>, laundry-washing, too. After all,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Ganga</ENAMEX>, however sacred, is also just a river. Out on stone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">platforms</ENAMEX>, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> perform gymnastics, part of a devout
        self-discipline known as danda.
        Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who might at first be reluctant to confront
        the omnipresence of death along the river will be impressed by the
        simple dignity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral</ENAMEX> rites here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Families</ENAMEX> bring their dead for
        their cremation to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiest</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi</ENAMEX> ghats, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manikarnika</ENAMEX>. The
        body, in a white shroud, is carried on a bier of bamboo to the river‚Äôs
        edge, where a few drops of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ganga</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are poured into the lips of the
        dead. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is placed on a pyre of perfumed sandalwood, which is
        then set alight.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jai Singh‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">observatory</ENAMEX> and learning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, the Scindia
        Ghat, is at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Man Mandir Ghat</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alamgir Mosque</ENAMEX> rises behind the sacred
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panchganga Ghat</ENAMEX>, said to be the mythical confluence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> Ganga
        subterranean tributaries.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chawk</ENAMEX> (bazaar) is famous for its perfumes, silks, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brassware</ENAMEX>. Look out for the gilded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vishwanath</ENAMEX>, the
        holiest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi</ENAMEX>, forbidden to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindus</ENAMEX>. You can view it
        from the building opposite before going behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> to see the
        sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bull</ENAMEX>, stained deep vermilion by the libations of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worshippers</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi Hindu University</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Museum</ENAMEX> with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">superb</ENAMEX> collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mughal</ENAMEX> miniatures, considered
        superior to the national collection in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>.
        Sarnath
        Now a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi</ENAMEX>, which is located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 10 km</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarnath</ENAMEX> is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> gave his famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Deer Park</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sermon</ENAMEX> (the veritable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> of the religion) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX>
        around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 530</TIMEX> b.c. (see pages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19‚Äì21</NUMEX>).
        It quickly became a leading pilgrimage site, attracting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">devout Buddhists</ENAMEX> from many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> as it still does <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Ashoka</ENAMEX> commanded his
        edict-pillars to be built within the monasteries and stupas, of which
        he had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> constructed. But just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Varanasi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarnath</ENAMEX> suffered
        at the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qutb-ud-din</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1194</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the ruins have been
        well restored; they are accompanied by an excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX>
        sculpture, which you should save to enjoy until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last</TIMEX>.
        On the western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chaukhaudi Stupa</ENAMEX>, built by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Gupta king</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century a.d.</ENAMEX> With a proud octagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> that rises out of the top of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, it was built to mark the passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humayun</ENAMEX>
        after his defeat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1540s</TIMEX>. The remains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> red-brick
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monasteries</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> can
        be discerned among the ruins in a pretty setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and sacred
        neem <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Since its attractive bricks were carried off to build
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, only a platform of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Main Shrine</ENAMEX>, which once
        marked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling place</ENAMEX> during his stay at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarnath</ENAMEX>, remains.
        West of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, surrounded by an iron railing, are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stump</ENAMEX> and fragments of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ashoka‚Äôs Pillar</ENAMEX>, which was once <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 15 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>) high. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> how the shine of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> has withstood the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,200 years</TIMEX>. Its inscription warns the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> people
        against the dissidence that could upset the important national unity
        under his leadership: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúNo one shall cause division in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Order of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monks</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        The dominant feature of these ruins is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">146-ft-</ENAMEX>)
        high, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cylindrical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dhamekh Stupa</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> a.d. ,
        which is believed by many to mark the ancient site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most
        famous sermon.
        Immediately below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">niches‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇperhaps</ENAMEX> they once
        held statues on display in the museum‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frieze</ENAMEX> of fine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">floral</ENAMEX> and geometrical patterns interspersed with pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and
        small seated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhas</ENAMEX>. If you should have a pair of binoculars, they
        will come in handy here: take a close look at the fine craftsmanship in
        this work of art.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Visitors</ENAMEX> will take delight in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX>, which is a
        treasure-trove of superb early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> sculpture dating from the third
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century b.c.</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">a.d. Greeting</ENAMEX> you as you enter the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> is its famous masterpiece, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX>-capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashoka‚</ENAMEX>Äôs pillar,
        a high point of the distinctive art of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mauryan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX>,
        symbol of power and pride, was an understandable choice as the emblem
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs regained nationhood in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> vigorous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX> stand back
        to back atop a frieze of animals comprising a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX>, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bull</ENAMEX>, and a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lion</ENAMEX>, each of them separated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheel of Law</ENAMEX>,
        resting on the inverted lotus that once connected it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pillar</ENAMEX>.
        Against the wall is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheel of Law</ENAMEX> that originally rose above the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>. As a gentle counterpoint to this, and sculpted some 700 years
        later, a cross-legged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> with a finely chiselled halo was added;
        look out for it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Deer Park</ENAMEX> to the north of the excavations is just
        a modern afterthought, pleasant to relax in, but not related to the
        original.
        Khajuraho
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is famous for the erotic sculptures of its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">medieval Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>; many come expecting to snigger. They leave,
        however, full of admiration, because the sandstone temples are marvels
        of harmony and the sculptures‚Äô true grace in their sensuality stifles
        any temptation to smirk.
        We have <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> to thank for uncovering these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masterpieces</ENAMEX>, around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1840</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-buried in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and hidden by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">overgrown</ENAMEX> jungle. They didn‚Äôt see the light of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> until their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excavation</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1923, 600 years</TIMEX> after being abandoned during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conquests</ENAMEX>.
        Khajuraho was capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rajput</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of the
        Chandellas, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> that brought vigour to love and war, as is clear in
        the temples they built from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th centuries</TIMEX>. The
        temples are divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>: western, eastern, and southern.
        The major ones, in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, are in a beautifully kept park
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> leading easily from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the other. To see the sculptures
        at their best, go in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning or afternoon</TIMEX>, or both, and then go
        back at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, when the temples are illuminated.
        The lovely <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lakshmana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vishnu</ENAMEX>, is one
        of the earliest, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> in which each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> (at
        each corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square platform</ENAMEX> on which it stands) are
        preserved.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> sikhara <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> rise above the entrance-porch in
        addition to: the mandapa <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> for worshippers; a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> for
        dancing-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>; and the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, surrounded by an ambulatory for
        walking around the image of the deity. The silhouette seems to suggest
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Himalayan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, but this may be more of a Brahmanic
        interpretation than the conception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>. The sculptures
        portray not only erotic postures, but also the adventures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishna</ENAMEX>:
        in one he uses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> to fend off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestlers</ENAMEX>.
        Visvanartha, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1002</TIMEX>, is more compact and ultimately
        more harmonious than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakshmana</ENAMEX>. Its sculptures include a flute-playing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maiden</ENAMEX> and a small nymph pulling a thorn from her foot.
        The most spectacular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is
        Kandariya-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mahadeva</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes culminating</ENAMEX> in the great <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-m-
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">98-ft-</NUMEX>) high sikhara, composed of row upon row of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX> other, smaller
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sikharas</ENAMEX>.
        Created at the height of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chandellas‚</ENAMEX>Äô power in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-11th century</TIMEX>, the sculpture inside is the most sophisticated and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ingenious</ENAMEX>: apsara dancing-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and sura-sundari nymphs coquettishly
        yawning, scratching, applying their makeup, or playing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parakeets</ENAMEX>, or with their cheerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kandariya</ENAMEX> is the largest
        of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khajuraho</ENAMEX> temples and adds, with its grand scale, a special
        exuberance to the life-enhancing spirit of the place.
        The eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Jain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX>. The most important is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parsvanatha</ENAMEX>, built in
        the classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sikhara-domed</ENAMEX> style and incorporating the
        sculptural themes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vishnu</ENAMEX> temples. While the religion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jains</ENAMEX> prohibits anything too explicit in sexuality, the ambience of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khajuraho</ENAMEX> is clearly contagious, and there are a lot of voluptuous,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX>-breasted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> here that you don‚Äôt usually see on a Jain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX>.
        Kanha
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanha</ENAMEX> is famo us, widely acknowledged as the best place
        for seeing an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> in the wild. In fact, for the sheer
        abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wildlife</ENAMEX> to be seen, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanha</ENAMEX> is probably the best national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and should not be missed.
        You might think the journey is a little complicated, but
        if you go to the trouble you will find it well worth the effort. You
        can either fly into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagpur</ENAMEX> or, if you‚Äôre coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khajuraho</ENAMEX>, take a
        train to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jabalpur</ENAMEX> and continue by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. It is, however, best to reserve
        your accommodation in forest rest-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in advance of your
        journey.
        The best season is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, when you‚Äôll be able to
        see plenty of beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheetal</ENAMEX> (spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>), blackbuck, sloth bear,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaur</ENAMEX> or bison (largest of the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX>), wild boar, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs unique
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">barasingha (‚Äú12-pointer‚Äù</ENAMEX>) swamp <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>, and also monkeys galore.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúProject Tiger‚</ENAMEX>Äù campaign is doing a sterling job here
        to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs jungles without neglecting the elusive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leopard</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Enthusiastic bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> might also spot black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ibis</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">crested</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">serpent</ENAMEX>-eagle.
        Tracking down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> is a subtle affair, and requires a
        degree of dedication, calm, and stealth. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first morning</TIMEX>, you take
        a jeep-safari at dawn to scout the terrain. The forest of sal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bamboo</ENAMEX> is a truly sweet-smelling delight, interspersed with rolling
        green meadows where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> and gaur graze. Game-trackers will be out
        by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> in an attempt to locate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger‚Äôs</ENAMEX> hunting ground for the
        evening safari.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of jungle-wise mahouts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> set out in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> to seek the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> in the most likely areas; you will be
        following in a jeep, keeping a watch out for any tell-tale signs that
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> is near. The things to listen and look out for could be any
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, or perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several</NUMEX>, of the following: the alarm bark of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX>,
        a noisy screech from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, and‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe most telling sign of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">all‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇvultures</ENAMEX> waiting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX> to abandon the leftovers of what
        he caught for lunch. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephant</ENAMEX> has located a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tiger</ENAMEX>, the mahout

        Sanchi
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">About one hour</NUMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bhopal</ENAMEX>, the stupas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanchi</ENAMEX> are
        the most admired <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> monuments in the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. The site,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from the third century</TIMEX> b.c. , when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashoka</ENAMEX> ordered stupas
        containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚</ENAMEX>Äôs relics to be built, is on a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">91-m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">300-ft</ENAMEX>) hill
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vindhya</ENAMEX> plateau.
        Stupas were originally burial mounds; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddhists</ENAMEX> developed
        them into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster</ENAMEX>-covered stone, inside which are caskets
        containing relics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>. Crowned by a chhattra (umbrella) made of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX>, the stupa was erected on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> with a fence to enclose the
        path. The stupas of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanchi</ENAMEX> lay in the jungle until they were uncovered
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1818</TIMEX>, but delay in their restoration led to their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plunder</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> stupas and the temples and monasteries from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX> a.d. can still be seen.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Stupa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stupa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first century</TIMEX> b.c.
        , envelops a smaller mound erected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some 200 years earlier</TIMEX>. It is
        surrounded by stone railings; in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace railing</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> torana
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gates</ENAMEX>, off north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest axes, perhaps in order to deceive
        evil spirits. Formed by square posts with finely sculptured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gates</ENAMEX> are topped by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three architraves</TIMEX> (crossbars), one placed above the
        other with dwarfs or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">At the time Stupa I‚</ENAMEX>Äàwas built, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> himself was not
        represented in human form, but symbolized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> on which he rode
        away from his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, by the wheel of law, by his footprints, and by
        the pipal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> under which he found enlightenment.
        The rest of humanity is present in the form of his
        worshippers, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, and yaksi nymphs. Despite the
        strict asceticism preached through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhism</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs clear that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> employed were given free rein regarding their joyous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensuality</ENAMEX>.
        The smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stupa III</ENAMEX>, to the northeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great</ENAMEX>
        Stupa, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> torana gate; it was originally built to contain the
        relics of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>, which are preserved in a casket
        with pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and jewels. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Stupa II</ENAMEX> mound is down on the
        western slope of the hill. Its circular balustrade has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> L-shaped
        entrances with a simpler decoration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fauna</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX>
        symbols. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Historians</ENAMEX> have noted that the horsemen are using stirrups,
        the earliest known example of their use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">EAST</ENAMEX>
        The east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> encompasses the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of Buddhism
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodh Gaya</ENAMEX>, the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhubaneshwar</ENAMEX>, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">challenge of Calcutta</ENAMEX>, a huge confrontation of vitality and hardship.
        You can cool off in the green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darjeeling</ENAMEX> or in the
        mountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikkim</ENAMEX>.
        Calcutta
        The town‚Äôs reputation for squalor has so deeply imbedded
        itself in the world‚Äôs imagination that it comes as a surprise to find
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcuttans</ENAMEX> to be the liveliest bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
        Bengalis are irrepressible; perhaps the challenge of coping with daily
        life in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 million</NUMEX> has sharpened their wit.
        Survival here is a creative art; it is no accident that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcutta</ENAMEX> remained the country‚Äôs intellectual and cultural capital long
        after it relinquished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>. Calcutta was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">writer Rabindranath Tagore, India‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Prize</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>, and of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">philosophers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramakrishna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vivekananda</ENAMEX>. Creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still
        make their name here.
        After the establishment-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calcutta</ENAMEX> seem bright, ebullient, and vitriolic; while
        Mumbai‚Äôs filmmakers are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> of melodrama, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcutta‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cinema</ENAMEX> is
        known for its sensitivity and poetry, producing faithful mirrors of
        village and city life in the hands of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satyajit Ray</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mrinal</ENAMEX> Sen. It is the proper home for the country‚Äôs best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>,
        which is simply and aptly named ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Museum</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        For all their ardent nationalism, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcuttans</ENAMEX> retain a
        strong, if sometimes sardonic, attachment to things <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>; in
        particular they have an affection for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> language, which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">you‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find spoken here with the most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">accents‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> often
        with a good deal more style and elegance than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> themselves
        can muster.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Bank</ENAMEX>
        Even if you‚Äôre not arriving in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, start
        your visit at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Howrah Station</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> in and around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> will
        douse you in something of a baptism by fire; you‚Äôll soon realize that
        only a small fraction of them are actually there to take a train. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">station</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for many: its entrance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platforms</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dormitory</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX>.

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, boasting 35,000 species of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>. The

        pride is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200-year-old</TIMEX> banyan <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ficus</ENAMEX> bengalensis, or

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Howrah Bridge</ENAMEX>, itself a national monument, conveys you
        across the river to the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. This massive steel suspension
        bridge stages the most magnificent traffic jams; it is a great place to
        gauge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bengali</ENAMEX> temperament.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>
        Another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maidan</ENAMEX>, is in the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">landscaped</ENAMEX> to allow for a clear line of fire from all around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>, it was rebuilt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Clive</ENAMEX> on a more easily defended site

        ferocious soapbox orators predicting the end of the world, but it is
        also visited by the most wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">charlatans</ENAMEX> peddling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and
        other questionable substances.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Ochterlony Monument‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇoriginally</ENAMEX> named after an

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are often seen going backwards.

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marble Palace</ENAMEX>, a bizarre tribute to Western art and
        architecture, can be found on tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Muktaram Babu Street</ENAMEX> northeast of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raja Majendra Mullick Bahadur</ENAMEX>, this huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palladian villa</ENAMEX>-turned-museum
        has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and menagerie of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. It recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randolph</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, with its imaginative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">juxtaposition</ENAMEX> of

        Bhubaneshwar
        As you fly down the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calcutta</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll suddenly
        spot a small forest of tall <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with a lake at its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
        These are the temples of that most holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bhubaneshwar</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orissa</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for easy day-trips to
        the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jain cave monasteries of Udaigiri</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chariot-temple</ENAMEX> of
        Konark, and the sacred pilgrimage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puri</ENAMEX>. Once there were
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jain</ENAMEX> sanctuaries in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bhubaneshwar</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 500</NUMEX>, mostly ruins, can still be traced, but only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> are visitable.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> are masterpieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu</ENAMEX> architecture.
        The oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">temples</ENAMEX>, dating from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>, are grouped around the sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúOcean Drop‚Äù lake</ENAMEX> of Bindu
        Sagar, the focus for bathing and purification ceremonies before the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> festivals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East of the Bindu Sagar</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX>
        Muktesvara, is a rust-colored stone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shiva</ENAMEX>, with a
        small bathing tank and gracefully arched torana gate. There is great
        peace and dignity in the temple‚Äôs proportions; the low curved pyramid
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> of worship and ribbed sikhara <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> over the sanctum repeat
        the classic silhouette of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orissa</ENAMEX> temples.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajarani</ENAMEX>, standing on a platform at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of a</TIMEX>
        pleasant garden, is a more robust structure than that of the
        Muktesvara, with a more pronounced pyramid over the worship <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, and a
        powerful sikhara behind it.
        The greatest of the city‚Äôs many temples is the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-11th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lingaraja</ENAMEX>, south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bindu Sagar</ENAMEX>. Off limits to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-Hindus</ENAMEX>, it can be viewed from an observation platform specially
        erected for the purpose by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curzon</ENAMEX>. A pair of binoculars will be
        particularly useful here, in order to appreciate the splendid detail of
        the carving on the soaring central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> dominating a whole complex of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX>. It is dedicated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Three Worlds</ENAMEX>,
        Tribhuvanesvara, who gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhubaneshwar</ENAMEX> its modern day
        name.
        Udaigiri
        The cave monasteries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Udaigiri</ENAMEX> are close to Bhubaneshwar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">airport</ENAMEX>. Excavated from a sandstone hill in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third and second</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries b.c.</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Udaigiri</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunrise Hill</ENAMEX>) caves were <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">priests</ENAMEX> and monks when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jainism</ENAMEX> was the state religion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalinga</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rani‚Äôs Monastery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cave 1</ENAMEX>) has carvings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>,
        maidens, and court <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancers</ENAMEX>, but unlike the caves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajanta</ENAMEX> and Ellora
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX>), there are no temples or central <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> for worship.
        Further up the hill, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ganesha Gumpha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cave 10</ENAMEX>) is set back
        on an esplanade and guarded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sturdy stone elephants</ENAMEX> holding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> of mangoes. The friezes are more sophisticated, showing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archers</ENAMEX> riding <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalinga</ENAMEX> reclining with his
        queen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cave 14</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hathi Gumpha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Elephant Cave</ENAMEX>), is important for the
        inscription above the entrance, which details the conquests and
        irrigation projects completed during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Kharavela‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13-year</TIMEX> reign,
        around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 b.c.</TIMEX>
        Konark
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Temple of Konark</ENAMEX> was conceived as a gigantic
        chariot for the great sun-god <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surya</ENAMEX> cantering inland from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean</ENAMEX>. The sikhara that once towered <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 ft</ENAMEX>) into the air like
        some symbolic and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">divine charioteer</ENAMEX> has gone, but the grandiose pyramid
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagmohan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of Audience</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> used to
        officiate, still soars above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> pairs of huge stone wheels sculpted
        into its huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> and drawn by numerous galloping <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sikhara</ENAMEX> toppled, its
        porous stone ruined by storms and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">plunderers‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> by the ambitious
        concept of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>. As you climb over the remains, you‚Äôll find
        they have a decidedly secular air. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surya</ENAMEX> was given his due with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dignified</ENAMEX> green chlorite statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">parsva-devatas</ENAMEX> (sun-deities) set in
        niches facing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> points of the compass, and much of the sculpture
        profusely decorating the walls emphasizes his life as a king‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">battles</ENAMEX>, the royal hunt, and life at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. The sensuality of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">aristocratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khajuraho</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX> of the chariot themselves, symbols of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindu</ENAMEX>
        cycle of rebirth, have beautifully carved spokes and hubs decorated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and gods. Beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX>, there are lively carved
        friezes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> playing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>. Look out as well for a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giraffe</ENAMEX>, which indicates the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> west coast‚Äôs early contact with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>. The masterpieces among the free-standing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">statuary</ENAMEX>, though, are
        the war-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> trampling the king‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">splendid elephants</ENAMEX>
        crushing the demons.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>, for whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> was an importa nt
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">landmark</ENAMEX>, enabling them to keep out of the dangerous shallows of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orissa</ENAMEX> coast (they nearly had it turned into a lighthouse), called it
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black Pagoda‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇin order to be able to distinguish it from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúWhite Pagoda‚Äù of Puri‚</ENAMEX>Äôs whitewashed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaggannath Temple</ENAMEX> further down the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>. After the huge sikhara <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> had collapsed, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British</ENAMEX>
        saved the pyramidal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jagmohan</ENAMEX> by pouring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX> into its core; now the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Survey of India</ENAMEX> is heroically performing massive
        restoration work on the important sculpture.
        Puri
        Even if you can‚Äôt be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puri</ENAMEX> for the tremendous Rath Yatra
        Festival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June/July</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is worth a visit just to see a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> devoted almost entirely to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúindustry‚Äù</ENAMEX> of its great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaggannath</ENAMEX>, either directly or by trading with the pilgrims.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Non-Hindus</ENAMEX> are not permitted within the temple <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">precincts</ENAMEX>,
        but you can get a good view from the roof of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raghunandan Library</ENAMEX>
        near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> wall. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, artisans, and other workers
        are employed within the grounds. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, all of
        them whitewashed and decorated with bright painted sculptures, the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is where the worshippers bring offerings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> is for sacred dances, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> for viewing the divine
        effigies, which are enshrined in the sanctum of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> and tallest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">edifice</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puri</ENAMEX> also has a beautiful beach, southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, which
        is ideal for cooling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">off‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇbut those aren‚Äôt sandcastles the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> are

        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heaven‚Äôs Gateway</ENAMEX>), where the faithful wash away their sins.
        Darjeeling
        Before you overdose on the countless temples or even just
        on the heat of the plains, follow the wise example of the long-gone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British of Calcutta</ENAMEX> and get up into the hills and greenery which lead
        to the lush cool of the celebrated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Darjeeling</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> gardens.
        At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,185</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,100 ft</NUMEX>), it‚Äôs a bit hard to breathe in the
        rarefied air, but take in the splendor of the Himalayan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mountains‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmount Kanchenjunga</ENAMEX> situated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sikkim</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX>), and,
        if you‚Äôre lucky on a clear day in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> or in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late September</TIMEX>
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Everest</ENAMEX> itself, up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1835</TIMEX>, the raja of the then-independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikkim</ENAMEX> was pressured into ceding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darjeeling</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brits</ENAMEX> believed it would be a healthy place for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East India</ENAMEX>
        Company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> to recover from the ills of the plains, but above all
        they found the area strategically useful for controlling a pass into
        much-contested <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> smuggled out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and an
        influx of plantation labor from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>, the little village of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> souls
        grew to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1849</TIMEX>. Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darjeeling</ENAMEX> is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>
        Bengal, but <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nepali</ENAMEX> remains the official language and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> are
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nepalese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan</ENAMEX> origin. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhists</ENAMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18 percent</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        A major part of the pleasure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darjeeling</ENAMEX> is in getting
        here. Although you‚Äôre driving along narrow mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll feel
        much safer than in the plains, because everyone takes infinitely more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>; lorry and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are clearly subdued by the deep
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ravines</ENAMEX>.
        But the best way to travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">up‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇat least part of the way,
        if you‚Äôre too impatient to take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> for the whole <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darjeeling Himalayan Railway</ENAMEX>, more popularly and

        far from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bagdogra</ENAMEX>. Built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1881</TIMEX>, the tiny steam-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>-cm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-ft</ENAMEX>) track climbs, loops, and zigzags through dense forests of sal,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX>, and teak which are alive with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">jungle birds</ENAMEX> and mountain

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rock</ENAMEX> (shaped like the statesman‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>). Also keep your eyes open for a

        The railway <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> admitted it might have been safer to
        dig some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>, but they preferred to go ‚Äúround the mountain‚Äù to
        allow for a better view of the terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> gardens and the valleys
        plunging down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bengal plains</ENAMEX>. Certainly when you reach the

        hover out on the loop over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darjeeling</ENAMEX> is in every sense of the word
        breathtaking.
        The only relics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Raj</ENAMEX> are the (now)

        A drive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger Hill</ENAMEX> before dawn is a popular excursion
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Westerners</ENAMEX> go on for different reasons, though both
        show the same almost religious excitement as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> fades. From an

        facing east. What matters is not the rare opportunity of seeing the
        world‚Äôs tallest mountain, but seeing the sunrise.
        For a closer look at the true roof of the world, consider
        a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">camping trek</ENAMEX>, on foot or pony, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandakhpu</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,650 m/11,700</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>). You‚Äôll get better views of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Kanchenjunga</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount</ENAMEX> Everest
        and pass through lovely forests of chestnut, magnolia, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rhododendron</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> will be in bloom.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Armchair mountaineers</ENAMEX> invariably enjoy the excellent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayan Mountaineering Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Darjeeling</ENAMEX>. It has
        on display some fascinating memorabilia of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayan</ENAMEX> expeditions, in
        particular the equipment used by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sherpa Tensing Norgay</ENAMEX> (here
        Indianized as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shri Tensingh</ENAMEX>), when, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Hillary</ENAMEX>, he was the

        Sikkim
        Once again, a great part of the joy of the place is the
        journey itself, by road to the capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gangtok</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,768 m/5,800 ft</NUMEX>), in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eastern Sikkim</ENAMEX> through the most spectacular scenery: rivers roaring
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">gorges</ENAMEX>, deep valleys outlined by terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice paddies</ENAMEX>, and
        forested hills. To protect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India‚Äôs</ENAMEX> border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and put an end to
        the unrest over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raja‚</ENAMEX>Äôs autocratic rule, the region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikkim</ENAMEX> was
        incorporated into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Union</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sikkim</ENAMEX> are
        mostly made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nepalese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lepchas‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> country‚Äôs original

        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>.
        The colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tibetan Buddhist</ENAMEX> monasteries are the most
        attractive sight in the valleys near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gangtok</ENAMEX>. The most easily
        accessible of them is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumtek</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> drove the

        Gangtok at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemayangtse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tashiding</ENAMEX>, are well worth visiting, but
        access to them may be restricted at times by the military

        Patna
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bihar</ENAMEX> serves as a base for visits to the
        sanctuaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodh Gaya, Rajgir</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nalanda</ENAMEX>, but its bazaars,
        first-class sculpture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sikh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, and the views of the
        Ganga river make it worth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a day</TIMEX> of your time.
        Patna was already in existence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,500 years ago</TIMEX>, when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahavira</ENAMEX> were active here. It later became the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mauryan</ENAMEX> emperors, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. , and one of the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ganga</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Patna</ENAMEX> for manufacturing and
        distributing opium in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> supplied with its
        favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> can still be seen by the river in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gulzarbagh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX>, now housing a printing press.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golghar</ENAMEX>, on the west side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> near the river, is
        evidence of the more altruistic side of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Patna</ENAMEX>. This
        great flat-topped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, a granary <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> ft) high, was erected

        The open ground on the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maidan</ENAMEX> is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahatma</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX> held mass prayer-meetings. Stand in the middle of the new Ganga
        Bridge to get a sense of the effect the river has on the lives of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>; it is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 miles</NUMEX>) wide here.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Har Mandir Takht</ENAMEX> in old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patna</ENAMEX> will give you a sense of the
        Sikh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. It was built on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gobind Singh</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1666‚Äì1708</ENAMEX>), who called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sikhs</ENAMEX> to defend their faith with armed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> (see pages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18‚Äì19</NUMEX>). The well that served <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gobind Singh‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is
        now a marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> exemplifies piety and militancy. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> will explain the faith and show you, among the guru‚Äôs relics,
        his cradle, shoes, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. Above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neophytes chant</ENAMEX> from the scriptures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adi Grant</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>, now a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> to history and a record of the tortures suffered by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sikhs</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bazaar</ENAMEX> nearby sells cheap bamboo and leather goods.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patna Museum</ENAMEX> offers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mauryan</ENAMEX> sculpture: a stone yaksi

        Bodh Gaya
        The site of the pipal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> or bodhi‚<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe tree</ENAMEX> of wisdom
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gautama Siddhartha</ENAMEX> became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enlightened One, Buddha‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇstands
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> great pilgrimages of his life. The others are those
        of his birth at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lumbini</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>); his first sermon at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sarnath</ENAMEX> (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">138</NUMEX>); and of his death at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kushinagar</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> is just outside
        Gaya, south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patna</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. M. Forster</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> can undertake their own private
        pilgrimage <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 miles</NUMEX>) north, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barabar Caves</ENAMEX>, which were the
        setting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚ÄúMarabar incident‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Forster‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous novel Passage to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forster</ENAMEX> commented, however, they have no artistic merit in
        themselves.
        The towering structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahabodhi Temple</ENAMEX>, built in
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth century</TIMEX>, evokes the gopuram gateways of south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. In
        keeping with other early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> tenets, there is no figurative
        representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> here, However, there is a large gilded statue
        from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a later</TIMEX> period inside, and behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> are the spreading
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> and trunks of the sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodhi Tree</ENAMEX>, which is said to have
        grown from a sapling of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one that stood here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,500 years ago</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilgrims</ENAMEX> visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> reverently drape its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> with white
        and saffron-colored veils. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">platform</ENAMEX> marks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddha‚Äôs</ENAMEX> seat and a set of
        large footprints symbolize his presence, while stone bowls mark where
        he walked. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhists</ENAMEX> still bathe where he bathed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        has stupa railings, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> Buddhas date from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>.
        The importance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodh Gaya</ENAMEX> pilgrimage is evident in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burmese</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">temples</ENAMEX> nearby.
        Rajgir
        This ancient city is due northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodh Gaya</ENAMEX>, out on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naland</ENAMEX>, and it has been holy to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddhists</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jains</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> b.c. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rajagriha</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the
        Magadha <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was frequented at different times by both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> and his contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vardhamana Mahavira</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the
        Jain religion.
        The surrounding green hills are topped by numerous temples
        of both religions, the best known being on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gridhakuta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vulture‚Äôs Peak</ENAMEX>),
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddha</ENAMEX> is believed to have converted the once fierce Mauryan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior king</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bimbisara</ENAMEX> to the peaceful doctrine of non-violence. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have built a great white stupa on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajgir‚</ENAMEX>Äôs principle hill,
        which you can reach by aerial ropeway‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa pleasant way to survey the
        rugged countryside.
        Nalanda
        In order for you to get the most out of the fascinating
        ruins of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Nalanda</ENAMEX>, it is
        recommended that you use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of a guide from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Survey of India</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashoka</ENAMEX> founded the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monastery</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajgir</ENAMEX>, which became a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of learning
        under the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gupta kings</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600 years later</TIMEX>. By the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiuen Tsang</ENAMEX>, came here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX>, it was a thriving
        university for teaching philosophy, logic, grammar, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, and
        Buddhist theology. It also sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> to spread Buddhism to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX> and attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX>.
        It was destroyed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 12th century</TIMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monks</ENAMEX> fled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> has a good model of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> and
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">monastery buildings</ENAMEX>, worth studying before you go out to the site.
        It also has a fine collection of bronzes from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> to the 12th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>. On the excavation site, you will see remains of dormitories
        in addition to the refectory, kitchens, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, lecture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>, and temples.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SOUTH</ENAMEX>
        Travelling between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mumbai</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calcutta</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs easy
        to forget that southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> exists. The attitude of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX>
        tends to be rather disparaging towards it, but a tour of the peninsula
        reveals a bright and cheerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with a culture as rich and varied
        as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">greener landscapes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe beautiful Malabar</ENAMEX> and Coromandel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coasts</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dravidians</ENAMEX> who make up most of the southern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations don‚</ENAMEX>Äôt mind being seen as different from northerners, but
        they don‚Äôt want to be disregarded. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeologists</ENAMEX> can trace their
        origins to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> of the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harappa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohenjodaro</ENAMEX>,
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indus valley</ENAMEX>. Their religion included elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hinduism</ENAMEX> such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva‚</ENAMEX>Äôs phallic lingam and his sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bull</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nandi</ENAMEX>, before the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahmanic Indo-Aryans</ENAMEX> arrived. Driven south, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dravidians</ENAMEX> remained
        not only geographically separate, but also politically independent,
        impervious to the waves of foreign invaders.
        Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindus</ENAMEX> battled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 16th</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, they were by no means united. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoysalas of Karnataka</ENAMEX>, the
        Cheras of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerala</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cholas, Pandyas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pallavas of Tamil Nadu</ENAMEX> all
        fought among themselves until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vijayanagar</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hampi</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnataka</ENAMEX>) emerged as dominant in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. Each of these
        kingdoms showed cultural vitality, exporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple-builders</ENAMEX> together
        with their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX>.
        Suffering less than the north from the ravages of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> iconoclasts,
        their temples have survived in profusion and in much better
        condition.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bangalore</ENAMEX> is in the vanguard of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs modernization, and
        Chennai, though without the self-promotion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mumbai</ENAMEX>, easily produces
        twice as many feature films as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mumbai</ENAMEX>.
        Madurai, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thanjavur</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanjore</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belur</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halebid</ENAMEX> are
        custodians of the peninsula‚Äôs ancient art treasures. The strong
        regional identity of the south has repeatedly foiled attempts to spread
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX> and make it the national language here. On the east coast they
        point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tamil</ENAMEX> literature is much richer than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hindi</ENAMEX>. On the west,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerala</ENAMEX>, who speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Malayalam</ENAMEX>, boast the highest literacy
        rate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> for the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX>
        percent for the next highest (the district of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mizoram</ENAMEX>); and this with a
        national average of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just over 52 percent</NUMEX>.
        Much better served by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX>, with some parts
        benefitting from the peninsula‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> monsoon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early winter</TIMEX>, the south‚Äôs vegetation is luxuriant and colorful. There
        are coconut groves on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malabar west coast</ENAMEX>, palmyra <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> on the

        Modern and efficient, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnataka</ENAMEX> is a

        Mysore
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home town</ENAMEX> of the maharajas regains a flicker of its
        old glory every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Dussehra festival</ENAMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX> of
        the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysore State</ENAMEX> is paraded through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> on his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> throne, surrounded by gorgeously <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caparisoned elephants</ENAMEX> (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">209</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysore</ENAMEX> remains a pleasant, airy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, famous for its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sandalwood</ENAMEX> and frangipani, jasmine, and musk. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">maharaja‚Äôs palace</ENAMEX> is
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and lit up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. It was constructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1897</TIMEX> (after
        its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> was burned down, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maharaja</ENAMEX> wanted a new one)
        and represents all the excesses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mughal</ENAMEX> nostalgia and undigested
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victoriana</ENAMEX>. Doors of solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> open onto the multicolored, stylish
        d√©cor of marble, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mahogany</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ivory</ENAMEX>. The highlight is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art gallery</ENAMEX>,
        with paintings of the maharajas in very <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, landed-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentry</ENAMEX> poses,
        and a glass case featuring a ‚Äúrolled gold replica of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> crown‚Äù
        set between a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> kettle which is noticeably bigger than the coffee pot
        near it.
        On the summit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chamundi Hill</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sri</ENAMEX> Chamundeswari
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> offers a fine view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysore</ENAMEX>. On your way back down the hill,
        take a look at the massive black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Nandi bull</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sacred mascot,
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> and bells that are a mixture of both real and sculpted
        items hung around its neck.
        Another popular sight are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brindavan Gardens</ENAMEX>, in Mughal
        style, some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">19 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysore</ENAMEX>, worth visiting at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
        when the fountains are flood-lit.
        Srirangapatnam
        The names of many southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> are longer than their
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. Situated due east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysore, Srirangapatnam</ENAMEX> was the site
        of the battles against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim ruler Tipu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sultan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1790s</TIMEX>, in
        which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> gained control of the peninsula.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">fort</ENAMEX>, which was taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornwallis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Wellesley</ENAMEX> (the Iron <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> with the rubber boots), no longer
        stands <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sultan‚Äôs summer palace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darya Daulat Bagh</ENAMEX>, has
        been preserved and made into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> honoring the brave resistance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tipu</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haidar Ali</ENAMEX>.
        Somnathpur
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kesava Temple</ENAMEX>, built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1268</TIMEX>, is a tiny, shining jewel
        in the crown of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> architecture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is small, no more
        than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 m</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ft) high, and its vimanas (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>) are set on a low,
        modestplatform, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> achieves a grandeur in miniature,
        peacefully enclosed in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> and isolated from the rest of the
        village.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> has been dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vishnu</ENAMEX> in his various
        aspects: as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Janardana the Punisher</ENAMEX>, shown as a rigid, solemn-looking
        statue on the north vimana; as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kesava the Radiant</ENAMEX>, after whom the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temple</ENAMEX> is named but whose statue is missing from the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>;
        and as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venugopala</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishna</ENAMEX> on the south <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, with another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishna</ENAMEX> as cowherd listening at his feet.
        With a domed sikhara on each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, the temple‚Äôs overall
        effect remains ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù in the style of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hoysala</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>,
        emphasized by the layers of narrow, parallel carved friezes running
        around the walls. Every <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square centimeter</NUMEX> of the temple‚Äôs surface is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sculpted</ENAMEX>. An unusual feature in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoysala</ENAMEX> temples is that their
        carvings are signed by the sculptors.
        Like the statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> cathedrals
        portraying events from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, the carvings were intended to be read
        like a book by those who had no access to the scriptures, which were at
        that time reserved for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahmins</ENAMEX>. They tell the stories of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇof the mischievous tricks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krishna</ENAMEX>, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> stealing butter
        from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and later as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> stealing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saris</ENAMEX> from girls
        bathing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">river‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> of the adventures of the epic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahabharata</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belur</ENAMEX> and Halebid
        The most comfortable way to see these important Hoysala
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX> is to visit them on either side of an overnight stay at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">120 km</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">75 miles</NUMEX>) northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mysore</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chenna Kesava Temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belur</ENAMEX> is also dedicated to
        Vishnu the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiant</ENAMEX>, but it was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1117, 150 years</TIMEX> before the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kesava</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Legend</ENAMEX> has it that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belur, Halebid</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somnathpur</ENAMEX> temples
        designed by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belur</ENAMEX> temple‚Äôs silhouette makes for
        an unfinished look, but it‚Äôs not certain that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> were ever
        planned. Here too, it is the sculpture rather than the form that gives
        the temple its impact.
        The friezes bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> to life with the legends of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">gods</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shiva</ENAMEX> the demon-killer, or scenes from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahabharata‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇincluding Prince Arjuna</ENAMEX> shooting a fish while looking at
        its reflection in an adjacent bowl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. The bracket figures are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">masterpieces</ENAMEX>: a huntress, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> dancing or singing, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> about
        to spray her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> with rose-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. By the south doorway, on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiselled</ENAMEX> beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> dancing with a demon, you can find
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lizard</ENAMEX> hunting a fly.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoysalesvara Temple</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Halebid</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</NUMEX>) from
        Belur, dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parvati</ENAMEX>, is the biggest of the
        Hoysala temples. It suffered some destruction by the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
        iconoclasts, so it‚Äôs worth visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX>, too,
        where some of the best of its statues are now kept. Look at the
        surprisingly fine carving of the bracket figures in the dancing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>,
        achieved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX> working with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soft steatite soapstone</ENAMEX> which
        subsequently hardened to the texture of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX>.
        Sravanabelagola
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Fifty km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 miles</NUMEX>) east of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vindhyagiri Hill</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rises 140 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">463 ft</ENAMEX>) above the plateau, with one of the most dramatic
        monuments in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, the statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gommatesvara</ENAMEX>, on its top. To get
        to it, you must climb barefoot‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe hill is holy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ground‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇup 644</ENAMEX> steps
        cut in the rock. Take it easy, and you‚Äôll find the trip well
        worthwhile.
        Erected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 983</TIMEX>, the statue crowns a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> erected
        in the village of Sravanabelagola <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,400 years earlier</TIMEX> by the Digambara
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sect of Jains</ENAMEX>, who regarded nakedness as part of the abnegation
        necessary to achieve true enlightenment (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>). It is believed
        that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">b.c. Chandragupta</ENAMEX> converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jainism</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sravanabelagola</ENAMEX> and fasted to death.
        Coming upon the statue at the top of the hill, even though
        you may have already seen it from a distance, is still an awe-inspiring
        experience. This Jain saint looms <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">171‚ÅÑ2 m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> ft) tall, carved from a
        granite monolith polished by centuries of libations with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX>.
        Gommatesvara, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of the prophet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adinath</ENAMEX>, is entirely
        naked except for a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX>-creeper winding itself around his legs
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. The creeper symbolizes the impassiveness he is said to have
        observed in this upright position of pratimayoga, which he adopted for
        one whole year in response to his brother‚Äôs lust for worldly power. An
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anthill</ENAMEX> and serpents at his feet symbolize the mental agony that his
        smile shows he had conquered.

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most charming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>,

        On a peninsula separated from the mainland by islands, the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX>. The great navigator‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> were returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portugal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1538</TIMEX>
        but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tombstone</ENAMEX> can still be seen on the south side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>,
        set in the floor with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brass</ENAMEX> rail.
        At the water‚Äôs edge on the northern tip of the peninsula,
        you can see the fishermen‚Äôs beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> dipping nets, a system
        imported from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> seas: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fishermen</ENAMEX> sling the nets over a pyramid

        Enjoy.
        For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kashmir</ENAMEX> who want to go on a trip down
        to the other end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">India‚</ENAMEX>Äôs southernmost point is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Comorin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kovalam</ENAMEX>), where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arabian Sea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> meet. There is
        nothing between you and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> here. If your timing is right,
        you‚Äôll see the sea‚Äôs bright colors when a full moon rises at the same

        Madurai
        The ancient capital of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pandya</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and one of the
        world‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madurai</ENAMEX> is still an important repository of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tamil</ENAMEX> culture. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> university <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamil Nadu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chennai</ENAMEX>.
        The feverish religious activity around the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> towering
        gopurams of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Temple</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> in its present form, may
        give you a sense of the intensity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hinduism</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minakshi Devi Shrine</ENAMEX>
        is dedicated to a pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hindu ‚Äúfish</ENAMEX>-eyed goddess‚Äù taken into the pantheon
        with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shiva‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhis Sundaresvara Shrine</ENAMEX> is next door. The
        Madurai festivals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> celebrate their marriage as a grand
        reconciliation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indo-Aryan</ENAMEX> invaders.
        Entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, walk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minakshi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>. Since
        the interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> is off-limits to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hindus</ENAMEX>, you can get a
        view of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> and the golden roofs by climbing the slippery
        stairs to the top of the south gopuram. At ground level, you can see
        the arcaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Lotus Tank</ENAMEX> and the temple‚Äôs bathing-place. At the
        west end is a detailed model of the whole temple complex.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kambattadi Mandapa</ENAMEX>, the ambulatory to the Sundaresvara
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrine</ENAMEX>, is the busiest place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worshippers</ENAMEX> in procession
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prostrate</ENAMEX> themselves, bringing offerings of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coconut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, and toss
        tiny balls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> onto blackened statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pillars</ENAMEX> (in fact only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">997</NUMEX>) is in the northeast corner, full of carved,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bizarre lion-elephants</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pandava</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX> from the
        Mahabharata from whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madurai Pandyas</ENAMEX> claim descent.
        Outside the eastern wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is the Pudhu
        Mandapa, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall of Audience of Tirumalai Nayak</ENAMEX>, who built the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX> bazaar of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tailors</ENAMEX>, metal-workers, and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">artisans</ENAMEX>.
        Stop off at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tirumalai‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a kilometer</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">southeast</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Temple</ENAMEX>. An elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relic</ENAMEX> of former splendor, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">palace</ENAMEX> boasts cusped arches and massive pillars modeled on the style of
        the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rajput</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rajasthan</ENAMEX>, but also some unmistakably tubby
        Dravidian gods on a frieze running around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>.
        Trichy
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianized</ENAMEX> name of this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is
        Tiruchchirappalli, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City of the Sacred Rock</ENAMEX>, but the place is still
        identified by its colonial name, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trichy</ENAMEX>, a short form of the equally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Trichinopoly</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it is a base for pilgrims visiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tamil Nadu‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great temple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, but every schoolchild, at least
        those from the old school, knew <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trichy</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> defeats of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1750s</TIMEX>.
        The famed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rock Fort</ENAMEX>, the main focus of these battles,
        looms over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from atop the great solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX> hill that gave
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> its name. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early days</TIMEX>, the impregnable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rock</ENAMEX> served as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, graced by temples and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cave-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>. Steep steps bring you up
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand Pillars</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Ganesh</ENAMEX>, from which there is a fine view over the Cauvery
        river, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Srirangam</ENAMEX>, and the plains beyond. On the way up,
        look for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh-century</TIMEX>, stout-pillared <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pallava cave-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> have maintained their presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trichy</ENAMEX>, with
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuit College of St. Joseph</ENAMEX> and the adjoining red-and-buff
        Neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Our Lady of Lourdes</ENAMEX>.
        Srirangam
        The numerous temple <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">precincts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sri Ranganathaswami</ENAMEX>, set
        on an island formed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cauvery</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few kilometers</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 miles</NUMEX>) from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trichy</ENAMEX>, enclose a complete <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">township</ENAMEX> of busy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">booths</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX>. Beyond the town‚Äôs outside wall are the temple‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">farmland</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">coconut plantations‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> a large, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lotus</ENAMEX>-covered bathing tank.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> itself, dedicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vishnu</ENAMEX> and already a
        theological center by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>, was founded a couple of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thousand years ago‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtradition</ENAMEX> takes it back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flood</ENAMEX>. Its present
        form comprises a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> concentric rectangular walled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX>,
        culminating in an inner sanctum, and dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th</TIMEX> and 16th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>, after it had been liberated from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> invaders who had
        previously used it as a fortress. However, many of the sanctuaries are
        in fact much older than this.
        Enter on the south side and proceed through an ornamented
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">gopuram gate-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">south Indian</ENAMEX> architecture. Next,
        pass under a series of soaring gopurams, where you can witness religion
        as a full-time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> occupation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> are crammed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX>
        selling shrine offerings of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sweets</ENAMEX>, curds, and coconut, as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">garlands</ENAMEX> and holy images. Elsewhere, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are cleaning the stables for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">temple elephants</ENAMEX> and the storehouses for the chariot-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> that
        carry the deities through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> during the festivals. Look out
        for the handsome pillared verandas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwellings</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Non-Hindus</ENAMEX> are allowed as far as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>.
        Here, on the south side, look for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venugopala Krishnan</ENAMEX>,
        with its charmingly sculpted figures in the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hoysala</ENAMEX> style of the
        temples at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halebid‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇnotice the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeet</ENAMEX>, which
        served in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> literature as a bearer of messages between passionate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX>. Climb up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terrace</ENAMEX> overlooking this shrine for an
        excellent view over the gopurams beyond the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golden</ENAMEX> vimana, the inner sanctum, and its arched roof with the god
        Vishnu portrayed on each side. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binoculars</ENAMEX> will be espe cially useful
        here.
        Most spectacular of all, though, set in the eastern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> enclosure, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sesharyar</ENAMEX> worship hall with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> carved pillars of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rearing horses bearing proud warriors</ENAMEX>. The
        energy of these minutely detailed sculptures from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>,
        which honor the military prowess of the then-great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vijayanagar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>,
        is a zenith of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">south Indian</ENAMEX> art.
        Thanjavur
        Known to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tanjore</ENAMEX>, this was the historic
        capital of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chola</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> that spread <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tamil</ENAMEX> culture to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burma</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>. Its artful sculpture and architecture can be
        seen to this day in the temples of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Java</ENAMEX>.
        Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX>, military power, and religious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fervor</ENAMEX> went together. More than the divinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brihadisvara</ENAMEX> boasts architecture celebrating the victory of
        the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chola</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pallavas of Kanchipuram</ENAMEX> and the Cheras
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerala</ENAMEX>. The accent is on the grandiose: the temple‚Äôs main vimana
        shrine consisting of a massive, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13-tiered pyramid some 66 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">222 ft</ENAMEX>)
        high.
        Shiva‚Äôs sacred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bull</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nandi</ENAMEX>, is built on a similarly
        colossal scale, as is the phallic lingam, believed to be the biggest in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frescoes</ENAMEX> insist (in gory detail) that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-chopping was
        necessary to achieve victory. However, a much more graceful
        architectural touch can be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX> demonstrating
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX> basic poses performed in the sacred dance, bharatanatyam (see
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">page 206</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chennai</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madras</ENAMEX>)
        Chennai, known until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madras</ENAMEX>, is easy-going,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pleasant</ENAMEX>, and remarkably uncrowded. The beach here is an amazing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 km</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 miles</NUMEX>) long, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chennai</ENAMEX> is also the place for banking and mailing
        packages, and for picking up letters from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> at the poste restante
        counter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Post Office</ENAMEX>.
        Chennai was set up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1642</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East India</ENAMEX> Company‚Äôs
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> east coast trading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> for shipping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX>. After
        the defeat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>, it took a grateful back seat in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affairs</ENAMEX>, far away from the turmoils of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</TIMEX>,
        fiercely independent-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tamil</ENAMEX> politics make the place much more
        lively and alert at election time, but less heated than, say, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calcutta, Mumbai</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punjab</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort St. George</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tamil Nadu‚Äôs State</ENAMEX>

        tracks north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX> (an area once known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúBlack Town‚Äù</ENAMEX>), is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Armenian Street</ENAMEX>. Still the center of a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>,
        there‚Äôs a busy street market and, in a cool, tree-shaded garden, an

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Museum</ENAMEX> situated on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantheon Road</ENAMEX> possesses
        excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Buddhist</ENAMEX> bronzes and a detailed collection of Dravidian

        make a fascinating demonstration in stone of the glory of south

        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> are the busy shopping

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University, Cricket Club</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Thom√© Cathedral</ENAMEX>. This simple, even
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">austere Neo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church houses</ENAMEX> what is claimed to be the

        Mahabalipuram
        The ancient port of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pallava</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>, a high point in any
        tour of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">south Indian</ENAMEX> monuments, is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 60 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 miles</NUMEX>) south of
        Chennai, but stay there overnight, rather than making a day-trip from
        Chennai, if possible. It has accommodations on the beach, enabling you
        to see the cliff-carvings, ratha <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shore Temple</ENAMEX> by the sea
        in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
        Originally the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mamallapuram</ENAMEX>, named after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Narasimha Mamalla</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">630‚Äì668</ENAMEX>), ‚Äúthe great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wrestler</ENAMEX>,‚Äù in whose reign
        its many extraordinary temples and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX> were begun. Like the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cave-temples of Ellora</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX>), most monuments are carved,
        rather than built, from solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX>, in this case the last cliffs and
        boulders of the vast granite plateau that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> at the Coromandel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> is a set of rathas, monolithic

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX>-and-brick construction, some have the same arched and domed roofs
        as the inner vimana sanctuaries that you can see at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Srirangam</ENAMEX> and at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thanjavur</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">191</NUMEX>). The largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-storied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pyramidal Dharmaraja</ENAMEX>, at the southern end, has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> figures, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gods</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>, and, fascinatingly, modest subjects such as temple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX>.
        Of the rock-carvings north of the rathas, the most
        celebrated is The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Penance</ENAMEX>. The narrative sculpture panels cover
        an entire cliff-face, in which a natural split in the rock has been
        assimilated as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ganga</ENAMEX> river as it descends through the hair of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shore Temple</ENAMEX>, which has withstood the wind and the
        waves for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 centuries</TIMEX>, is made up of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>. Shiva the Destroyer
        faces dangers at sea while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vishnu</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Preserver</ENAMEX> watches over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> is clearly inspired by the styling of the monolithic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dharmaraja</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX>, but it is more tapered because originally it had to
        double as a lighthouse, a bright beacon burning at its apex.
        Kanchipuram
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanchi (‚ÄúGolden City‚Äù</ENAMEX>) has scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">temples‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇhundreds</ENAMEX>,
        if you include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shrines‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇdedicated</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vishnu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shiva</ENAMEX>, and it is
        highly revered as one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. (The
        others are: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varanasi, Mathura, Hardwar, Dwarka</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayodhya</ENAMEX>. ) It‚Äôs an
        easy trip to make from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mahabalipuram</ENAMEX> and you can stop off to shop in
        Kanchipuram for silk.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kailasanatha</ENAMEX> is one of the most important Shiva
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sanctuaries</ENAMEX> dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighth century</TIMEX>. The sandstone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> on a
        granite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> houses some graceful sculptures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shiva</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parvati</ENAMEX> as a
        celestial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">queen</ENAMEX> receiving homage from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> at their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Kailasa</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vaikuntaperumal</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vishnu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of the same
        period, famous for its elevated colonnade of lively sculpted reliefs
        showing the many exploits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pallava</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX>.
        Pondicherry
        The most visible <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gallic</ENAMEX> touch in this bastion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> colonial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adventure</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">scarlet k√©pi worn</ENAMEX> by the
        white-uniformed traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> waving you on as you drive into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>.
        Many of the street names are still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">French‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇRue Suffren</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue Lauriston</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue Dumas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexandre</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rue Dupleix</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> known as Rue Jawaharlal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nehru</ENAMEX>. However, only few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">French War</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial</ENAMEX> on the coast road stands opposite a monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX>. After
        250 years of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> rule in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pondicherry</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> were fortunate to
        have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decolonizer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Mend√</ENAMEX>®s-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> to deal with when it was
        retrieved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</TIMEX>.
        Apart from the pleasant white sandy beach, for nostalgics
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX> there‚Äôs a pilgrimage to be made to the inspirational
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚ÄúMecca</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äù Auroville</ENAMEX>. This spiritual retreat, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) north of
        Pondicherry, was started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> disciple of the teachings
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sri Aurobindo</ENAMEX>. It lost some of its dynamism because
        of squabbles following the death of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Mother</ENAMEX>. But the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äúorganic‚Äù</ENAMEX> forms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, with names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fraternity</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aspiration</ENAMEX>, still have an impact on the landscape. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavians</ENAMEX> and
        Bavarians cycle by, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX> seems as remote as when the first
        cattle-herders came here from the other side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,500</NUMEX> years
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dravidians</ENAMEX> were already here to meet them.
