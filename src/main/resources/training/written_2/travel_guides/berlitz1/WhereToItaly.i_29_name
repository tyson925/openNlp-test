        Planning an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> vacation entails a series of difficult
        decisions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äú Doing‚Äù Italy</ENAMEX> is a lifetime job, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">devotees</ENAMEX> are so
        in love with the place that they won‚Äôt even think of an alternative
        destination. After a predictable <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> romance with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence</ENAMEX>, they spend the rest of their lives systematically working
        their way through the small but wildly varied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, region by
        region, visit after visit. If this is your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> trip, you‚Äôll do well
        to establish an overall impression. If the seduction works, and it
        usually does, you‚Äôll want to come back time and again.
        This section includes all the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and
        regions to help you make your choice. Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> areas has a
        principal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> as a focus or starting point: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> for central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>,
        plus <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sardinia</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umbria</ENAMEX>, and the Adriatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">seaside</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> to the east; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veneto</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolomites</ENAMEX>, and
        Emilia‚Äôs historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parma</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ravenna</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombardy</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piedmont</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera</ENAMEX> to the west; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> for the south
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sicily</ENAMEX>.
        Given the sheer and unrivaled richness of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, the
        selection of places within those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> areas is not in any way
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exhaustive</ENAMEX> (nor, by the same token, exhausting). Those who already know
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> will inevitably feel that a few of their favorite spots have
        been neglected (though they may also be grateful to not have their
        secret exposed), while they‚Äôll find others they never heard of.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Newcomers</ENAMEX> will have an embarrassment of destinations to choose
        from.
        Depending on how much time you have for that all-important
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> taste, we suggest you try to visit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX>, even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. Those with a passion for the big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> can combine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome</ENAMEX>
        with the artistic delights of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magical</ENAMEX> romance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>. For many, the key to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy‚Äôs Mediterranean</ENAMEX>
        soul is to be found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> and the south. After the intense emotion
        and summertime heat spells (air conditioning is not always available),
        cool off at the seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX> or any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gem</ENAMEX>-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>.
        The trick is in the mix. Not just geographically, in
        exploring the variety and contrasts of north and south, but in
        combining the attractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and countryside and the resultingly
        different facets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life. Nowhere is it easier or more
        delightful to overdose on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and monuments than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>. A dear
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> returned from her first visit with the observation: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúItaly‚Äôs</ENAMEX>
        very nice, very nice indeed, but for my taste, much too much history. ‚Äù
        While it would be a crime to ignore the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, palazzos, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>
        chronicling the unparalleled glories of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history, the best way
        to enjoy them is also to spend plenty of time soaking it in from a
        front-row seat in a caf√©, or from under a canvas beach umbrella
        watching seaside life unfold. The siesta is one of the greatest of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, and the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> expression you may
        ever learn is dolce far niente (the sweetness of doing nothing).
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> cannot manage to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> outside the major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> periods‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇEaster</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. But if your options are
        more flexible, the most enjoyable (though equally crowded) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> are
        May, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">October‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇespecially</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany</ENAMEX>. Certainly, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> can be almost unbearably hot and
        humid in most big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, but some find an odd, ghostly pleasure in
        being in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferragosto</ENAMEX> (on and around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 August</TIMEX>) when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">abandoned ‚Äúto the cats</ENAMEX> and the crazy. ‚Äù And remember, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> make no
        bones about public <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">233</NUMEX>); they just close the whole
        country down.
        Getting Around
        Even the most free-spirited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> can use a little help
        occasionally. With the tourist industry such a vital factor in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> has an elaborate network of information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Bureaucrats being bureaucrats</ENAMEX>, efficiency and amiability vary from
        place to place, but the tourist information <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> all provide useful
        maps and brochures.
        For general information, the state tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> ENIT
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ente Nazionale Italiano per il Turismo</ENAMEX>) has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in major foreign
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> as well as regional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>. When in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, look instead for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azienda di Promozione Turistica</ENAMEX>) for more detailed regional
        sightseeing information; they occasionally help as well with hotel and
        camping accommodation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compagnia Italiana di Turismo</ENAMEX>) is a
        national travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> for transportation, excursions, and hotel
        bookings.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Travel Tips</ENAMEX> section at the back of the book (see page
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">217</NUMEX>) gives detailed practical guidance on the technicalities of travel
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, but here are some general thoughts to help you plan your
        trip.
        Major journeys from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to another,
        say, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> or down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>, is most enjoyed by train
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> with plenty of time, patience, and curiosity. The
        uncertainties of schedules and frequency of strike action gradually
        disappeared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, but the occasional wrinkle still needs to be
        ironed out. If you are making a long rail journey, don‚Äôt rely on the
        generally dreary dining-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>. Make up your own picnic hamper of
        cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meats</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> from the local
        market before you get aboard. Very often, you end up sharing it with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who offer in exchange their own homemade
        goodies.
        The great breathtaking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> adventure remains the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
        The autostrada (toll motorway or expressway) runs the length and
        breadth of the peninsula, a challenge to the imagination and survival
        instincts of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> civilization. Only to the uninitiated do Italian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> seem dangerous. Most of them are highly skillful‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthey have to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">be‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> proud of their reflexes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> to avoid: recklessness
        and excessive caution. Don‚Äôt try to match their improvisations, you
        will only raise their competitive spirit into the realm of high risk.
        They may be similarly provoked by indecisive and slow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>.
        Keep your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for use on the open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. In the overcrowded
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, just drop your bags off at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, and then park your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.
        To see the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, you should walk, take a bus, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX>, or rent a
        bike. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> have solved the problem for you by closing off their
        historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> (centro storico) to traffic: Consider that your
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rental</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> will cost you money while remaining unused albeit safely
        parked.
        Try to vary the kind of places that you stay in. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> has
        all types of accommodations available, so you‚Äôll have quite a few
        choices. Small family-run hostelries and country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">inns</ENAMEX> are charming,
        but, depending of course on your budget and personal preferences,
        consider indulging for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least one night</TIMEX> on the special comforts and
        pampering of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. Look for converted monasteries and
        countryside farmhouses. In most cases the frugality has long gone, the
        heating is modern, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval well</ENAMEX> has been replaced by a
        swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX>, but the setting is still memorable.
        Even if you‚Äôre a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">linguistic dud</ENAMEX>, try to learn a handful of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> words or expressions. The pronunciation is remarkably easy and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> are usually delighted by anyone making the effort. A
        cheerful buon giorno (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">good day</TIMEX>) or buona sera (good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>) can work
        wonders when entering or leaving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX>. In a land where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">politeness</ENAMEX> is important, per favore (please), grazie (thank you), prego
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">don‚</NUMEX>Äôt mention it), and, when pushing through a bus or market, permesso
        (excuse me) will be greatly appreciated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find some additional
        phrases beginning on page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">218</NUMEX>. Now enjoy it, buon viaggio!
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENTRAL ITALY</ENAMEX>
        The center of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> is the cradle of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> civilization,
        one-time administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of that ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerate</ENAMEX> known
        as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>. Immediately surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, today‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazio</ENAMEX> is the
        ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latium</ENAMEX>. On the eastern flank of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apennines</ENAMEX>, the
        Abruzzi region, of which the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molise</ENAMEX> is a recently created
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">offshoot</ENAMEX>, came under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> domination in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c.
        First-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> will understandably want to spend most or all of
        their time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, but the area surrounding the capital makes a
        pleasant excursion within fairly easy reach of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> for those
        adventurers with wheels and extra time.
        The rugged island of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sardinia</ENAMEX> deserves <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a week</TIMEX> to
        do it justice, but you may want to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long weekend</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of its
        attractive little seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>
        Crowning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hills along the winding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">River</ENAMEX>
        Tiber, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> has numerous different personalities: ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imperial ruins; Catholic Rome</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vatican City</ENAMEX> and countless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>;
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Borromini</ENAMEX>; and a modern metropolis of interminable traffic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jams</ENAMEX>, fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> and caf√©s, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> and
        characterless apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that make up the post-war eye-sore
        suburbs.
        None is easily separable from the others. The secret of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eternal City‚</ENAMEX>Äôs magic is that it lives and relishes all its ages
        simultaneously. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Churches</ENAMEX> are commonly built on the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> baths
        or pagan temples. The trendy caf√© <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Navona</ENAMEX> draw natural
        inspiration from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs grandiose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> fountain.
        Ease yourself into this magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that has hosted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> for millenia. To know its every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crook</ENAMEX> and cranny is a daunting
        challenge, but concentrate on the ancient city around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX> or
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican‚</ENAMEX>Äôs formidable complex, and come to know one age at a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>
        Make an early start with breakfast (or come back for a late
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon ap√©ritif</TIMEX>) on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza del Popolo</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caff√® Rosati</ENAMEX>, a veritable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> and historical meeting-place of the city‚Äôs literary
        personalities. Its outdoor tables are a perfect vantage point for
        admiring the gracefully curving piazza, an exemplary piece of open-air
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> theater designed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1816</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuseppe Valadier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX>.
        On the north side, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Maria del Popolo</ENAMEX> is
        important for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Raphael‚Äôs Chigi Chapel</ENAMEX>, exquisite frescoes by
        Pincuricchio, and, above all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> profoundly disturbing early
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caravaggio</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Conversion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Paul</ENAMEX> and
        Crucifixion of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cerasi Chapel</ENAMEX> left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>.
        Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, an arched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> gateway marks
        what was the entrance to ancient and medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX>
        Flaminia, leading from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rimini</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX> coast. The obelisk in the
        piazza‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, dating from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rameses II</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th century</TIMEX> b.c.
        ), was brought here from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circus Maximus</ENAMEX> and re-erected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixtus V</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1589</TIMEX>. Rounding off the south side are the twin Baroque
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Maria dei Miracoli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Maria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montesanto</ENAMEX>,
        completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gianlorenzo Bernini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fontana</ENAMEX>.
        Above the piazza to the east, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pincio</ENAMEX> gardens offer a
        magical view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, especially at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>. (For the great art
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa</ENAMEX> Borghese park behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pincio</ENAMEX>, see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>. ) The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascending Pincio</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promenade</ENAMEX> lined with umbrella pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> takes you
        past the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Medici</ENAMEX>, home of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> visiting on national

        spring with pink azaleas, was celebrated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Keats</ENAMEX> as a ‚Äúblissful
        cloud of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer indolence‚Äù</TIMEX> before he died here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at
        the bottom of the steps has been preserved as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>.
        Named after a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> used as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX>, the
        famous steps and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza di Spagna</ENAMEX> are the heart of the city‚Äôs most
        fashionable and exclusive shopping enclave, leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via del</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corso</ENAMEX>. The piazza‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> sunken<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">-boat</ENAMEX>-shaped marble fountain,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fontana della Barcaccia</ENAMEX>, is by the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">great Bernini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. The nearby
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venerable Babington‚Äôs Tea Rooms</ENAMEX> are a relic of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when Romans
        called the piazza the ‚ÄúEnglish ghetto. ‚Äù More <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quintessentially</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>,
        on nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Condotti</ENAMEX>, is the city‚Äôs oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Caff√® Greco‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpopular</ENAMEX>, as you‚Äôll see from pictures, busts,
        and autographs, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goethe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baudelaire, Liszt, Casanova</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fellini</ENAMEX>.
        This is the general area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trevi Fountain</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fontana di</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trevi</ENAMEX>) which benefited from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fellini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs keen sense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX> aesthetics
        when he dipped the dazzling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anita Ekberg</ENAMEX> in its legendarily purifying
        waters for his film <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Dolce Vita</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs been quite some time since
        anyone was caught romping in these waters reflecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicola Salvi‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        astounding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> fountain. It is in fact a triumphal arch and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">palace fa√ßade</ENAMEX> (to the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Poli</ENAMEX>) framing mythic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creatures</ENAMEX> in a
        riot of rocks and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rearing horse</ENAMEX> symbolizing the ocean‚Äôs
        turmoil and a calmer steed its tranquility. Tucked away behind narrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alleys</ENAMEX>, this recently restored extravaganza is out of all proportion to
        its tiny piazza and no amount of signposts leading to it can prepare
        you for the marvellous shock of discovery. Romantics go at the dead of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, to be alone with its illumination. It‚Äôs a favorite haunt for
        local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX> looking for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innocents</ENAMEX> abroad. Tradition dictates
        a toss of a coin over your shoulder to ensure a return trip.
        That other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la dolce vita</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Veneto</ENAMEX>, has
        been deserted by its starlets and paparazzi and only the expensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caf√©s</ENAMEX>, once stylish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and five-star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> remain. Slowly, it is
        making something of a comeback in popularity.
        On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> hills of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortress-like Palazzo del Quirinale</ENAMEX>, once summer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> to popes
        fleeing the malarial swamps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> down by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiber</ENAMEX>, housed
        the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1870</TIMEX>, and since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX> is the presidential
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX>. The only embellishment on its formidable fa√ßade is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        graceful porch, but its piazza is worth the climb for the view over the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX>.
        You couldn‚Äôt miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza Venezia</ENAMEX> if you tried‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand many do
        try, because of its endless traffic jams and the arguably ungainly
        white marble <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vittorio Emanuele Monument</ENAMEX>. The monument celebrates the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</ENAMEX>
        with inimitable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pomposity</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> of the monument, the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palazzo Venezia</ENAMEX> is a fine example of severe but elegant
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Renaissance</TIMEX> architecture, now containing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of medieval and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> arms, furniture, and sculpture. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX> had his office
        there and harangued his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> from the balcony.
        Beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Venezia</ENAMEX>, a steep staircase leads up to
        the austere <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Maria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aracoeli</ENAMEX>, while another, more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">graceful</ENAMEX> and gradual, takes you up between the statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castor</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollux</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelangelo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs beautifully proportioned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campidoglio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitoline Hill</ENAMEX>). This quiet traffic-free haven forges a
        superb link between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most sacred
        site, where sacrifices were made to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juno</ENAMEX>. The grand bronze
        equestrian statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Aurelius</ENAMEX> that anchors the piazza‚Äôs center
        is a copy; the restored original from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second century</TIMEX> a.d. is
        sheltered within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Nuovo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> to its left. Opposite stands
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo dei Conservatori</ENAMEX>, and at the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the
        handsome <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Senatorio</ENAMEX> (now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall</ENAMEX>). These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> palazzos house the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capitoline Museums</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>),
        whose <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> collections provide an excellent introduction to
        the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Forum</ENAMEX> that spreads below it.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ges√π</ENAMEX>, severe and relatively discreet on
        its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Venezia</ENAMEX>, was a major element in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits‚Äô Counter-Reformation</ENAMEX> campaign. Begun as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúheadquarters‚Äù</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1568</TIMEX>, its open ground plan was the model for the
        Congregational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> that were to regain popular support from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protestant</ENAMEX> faith. While its fa√ßade is more sober than the exultant
        Baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> put up as the movement gained momentum, the interior
        glorifies the new militancy in gleaming <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, marble, and
        precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>. Perhaps inevitably, the church‚Äôs most elaborate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ornament</ENAMEX> is the altar of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Ignatius Loyola</ENAMEX>, covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of the
        Jesuits‚Äô <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Spanish</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> in the left transept. Its profusion of lapis
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lazuli</ENAMEX> is actually a thin shell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fused</ENAMEX> to plaster stucco.
        In gentler contrast, the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant‚</ENAMEX>ÄôIgnazio
        stands in an enchanting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rococo</ENAMEX> stage-set of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>.
        Inside, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Pozzo</ENAMEX> (himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jesuit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">saint‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ges√π</ENAMEX>) has painted a superb trompe l‚Äôoeil ceiling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fresco</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1685</TIMEX>) depicting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Ignatius‚</ENAMEX>Äô entry into paradise.
        The circular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantheon</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza della Rotonda</ENAMEX>) is the
        best-preserved monument of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals the Colosseum</ENAMEX> in its
        combination of quiet elegance and sheer massive power. Built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadrian</ENAMEX> around a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> on an earlier site destroyed by fire, it
        achieved a marvel of engineering with its magnificent coffered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>:
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">141 ft</ENAMEX>) in interior diameter (larger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs</ENAMEX>),
        exactly equal to its height. Bronze that once embellished the entrance
        was carted away and recycled as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs canopy for the high altar in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs.</ENAMEX> This ‚ÄúTemple of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gods‚Äù</ENAMEX> today contains the tombs of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX> as well as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vittorio Emanuele II</ENAMEX> and his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umberto I.</ENAMEX>
        Caravaggio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">admirers</ENAMEX> will find some of his greatest
        masterpieces right in the neighborhood: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">St.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> trilogy in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fine Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Luigi dei Francesi</ENAMEX>, and the moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>

        Pause now at a caf√© in that most serene of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> squares,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Navona</ENAMEX>. Nowhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> is the spectacle of Italian street
        life more pleasantly indulged, thanks to an inspired collaboration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genius</ENAMEX> across the ages. The elongated oval piazza was laid out
        around a.d. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domitian</ENAMEX> as an athletics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circus</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agonalis‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa</ENAMEX> sporting tradition continued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX> with
        jousting tournaments and other events in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> that followed.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 17th century</TIMEX> contributed its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sublime Baroque d√©cor</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it is
        protected as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        Fountain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Four Rivers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fontana dei Fiumi</ENAMEX>) celebrates the great

        Bernini‚Äôs scorn for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile god</ENAMEX> covers his

        and the river god of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX> is poised to catch it in case it

        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Borromini‚Äôs splendid‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand structurally impeccable‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfa√ßade</ENAMEX> and

        takes place every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campo dei Fiori</ENAMEX>, overseen by the

        him alive here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX> for his preposterous idea that the universe was
        infinite, with many more galaxies than ours. An even more famous death
        occurred at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piazza del Biscione</ENAMEX>, more precisely the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">restaurant Da Pancrazio</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cellar shelters</ENAMEX> ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pompeii‚</ENAMEX>Äôs

        Only with a special appointment can you visit the glorious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palazzo Farnese</ENAMEX>, built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio da Sangallo the Younger</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giacomo della Porta</ENAMEX>. Begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1514</TIMEX>, it now houses the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy</ENAMEX>. Only the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX> is accessible to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, but its grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> and the
        handsome stuccoed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vestibule</ENAMEX> leading to it make it well worth a visit. A
        privileged few get in to see the ceremonial dining room‚Äôs fabulous
        frescoes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annibale Carracci</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> pay a rent of one

        Narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> southeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campo</ENAMEX> de‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiori</ENAMEX> take you to

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> have been a permanent feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> life for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 2,500</NUMEX> years
        but were forced into a ghetto in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>. A small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> still lives nearby around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via del Portico d‚ÄôOttavia.</ENAMEX> The

        The nucleus of classical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> is around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX>, with

        Don‚Äôt be daunted‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeven the best-informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> find the monumental
        relics difficult to decipher‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe mystery itself is more than half the

        avoid the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> sun in the shadeless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forum</ENAMEX>, and finish your visit with
        a picnic and siesta on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palatine</ENAMEX>. Even if you‚Äôre not an archaeology
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buff</ENAMEX> who wants to understand the meaning of every <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs worth at

        Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs countless inspirational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and palazzos, it

        Gladiators, once <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> and slaves but later professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warriors</ENAMEX>,
        fought one another to the crowds‚Äô cries of Jugula! (‚ÄúSlit his throat! ‚Äù
        ).
        For their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX> and princes
        have stripped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX> of its precious marble, travertine, and
        metal. In the arena‚Äôs basin, they have left a ruined maze of cells and
        corridors that funnelled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">beasts</ENAMEX> to the slaughter. The horror
        has disappeared beneath the moss and what remains is the thrill of the
        monument‚Äôs endurance. As an old Anglo-Saxon prophecy goes: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚ÄúWhile</ENAMEX>
        stands the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Colosseum, Rome</ENAMEX> shall stand; when falls the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>
        shall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX>; and when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> falls, with it shall fall the world. ‚Äù There
        is reason to believe it shall stand forever, a massive top-to-toe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restoration</ENAMEX> completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> has it looking rejuvenated and
        soot-free.
        The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine</ENAMEX> celebrates the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor‚</ENAMEX>Äôs battlefield conversion to Christianity. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cost-conscious Senate</ENAMEX> took fragments from monuments of earlier rulers
        Trajan, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hadrian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Aurelius</ENAMEX> to decorate the arch.
        Immediately northeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Domus Aurea</ENAMEX>,
        the fabulous villa with extensive gardens built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nero</ENAMEX>,
        who spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a few years</TIMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚ÄúGolden House‚Äù</ENAMEX> before killing himself
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 68</TIMEX>. It was reopened to the public in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX> of
        renovation work. On a site once <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> times the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> can be visited, and by guided tour
        only.
        With an exhilarating leap of the imagination, you can stand
        among the columns, arches, and porticoes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Forum</ENAMEX> and picture
        the civic, commercial, and religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the first
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to house <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX>. Earthquake, fire, flood, and
        the plunder of barbarians and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> reduced the area
        to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">muddy cow</ENAMEX> pasture until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the excavations of the 19th century</TIMEX>.
        Today, a detailed map and portable sound-guides rented at the entrance
        (on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via dei Fori Imperiali</ENAMEX>) will make sense of the apparent
        confusion and help you trace the layout of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, temples, and market
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">halls</ENAMEX>.
        Part of the brick-built <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Curia</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Senate</ENAMEX>,
        still stands. Steps nearby lead underground to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lapis Niger</ENAMEX>, a black
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marble pavement</ENAMEX> laid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX> over the presumed grave of
        Romulus, the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX>. To the south of it are remains of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basilica Julia</ENAMEX> law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rostra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">orators‚Äô platform</ENAMEX> from which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Antony</ENAMEX> informed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caesar‚</ENAMEX>Äôs assassination. Countless
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sculptors</ENAMEX> have drawn inspiration from the
        friezes on the triple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Septimius Severus</ENAMEX> (honoring a
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> who died in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, the northernmost
        boundary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn</ENAMEX> doubled as state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX> and center
        of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">debauchery</ENAMEX> known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saturnalia</ENAMEX>, pagan precursor of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>. In the circular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Vesta</ENAMEX>, the sacred flame
        perpetuating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> was tended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vestal Virgins</ENAMEX> who, from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">childhood</ENAMEX>, observed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-year</TIMEX> vow of chastity on fear of being buried
        alive if they broke it. At the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Sacra</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arch</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titus</ENAMEX>
        commemorates the sack of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> in a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>.
        Most impressive monument of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Imperial Forums</ENAMEX>, built as
        an adjunct to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Forum</ENAMEX> in honor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustus</ENAMEX>,
        Trajan, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vespasian</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domitian</ENAMEX>, is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-ft-</ENAMEX>) high Trajan‚Äôs
        Column (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">a.d. 113</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celebrating Trajan‚</ENAMEX>Äôs campaigns against the Dacians
        in what is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romania</ENAMEX>, the minutely detailed friezes spiraling around
        the column constitute a veritable textbook of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> warfare utilizing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 2,500</NUMEX> figures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚</ENAMEX>Äôs statue on top replaced that of the
        emperor‚Äôs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1587</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of the Roman Forum</ENAMEX>, a slope leads up to the Palatine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a romantic garden, dotted
        with toppled columns among the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and spiny acanthus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>.
        Only rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cypress trees</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pavilions</ENAMEX> remain from the more
        formal botanical gardens laid out here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farnese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. A small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> reopened here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. From its grassy
        knolls, enjoy the fine view back over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX> or southward over
        the great <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circus Maximus</ENAMEX>, where chariot races were held for crowds of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 200,000</NUMEX>.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilometer</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about half a mile</NUMEX>) south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colosseum</ENAMEX>, the
        huge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baths of Caracalla</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terme di Caracalla</ENAMEX>) were built
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to bathe in considerable style and luxury. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>
        and gymnasia were of alabaster and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">granite</ENAMEX>, decorated with statues and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frescoes</ENAMEX>. Public bathing was a prolonged social event as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> passed from the calidarium (hot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>) to cool down in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tepidarium</ENAMEX> and frigidarium. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> the stage for spectacular
        open-air operas in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, the calidarium was vast enough for the
        unique setting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Verdi‚Äôs ‚ÄúAida‚Äù</ENAMEX> and its processions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX>,
        camels, and endless cast. Rumors persist that the performances will
        resume again: stay tuned.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> begins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Appian Way</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Appia</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antica</ENAMEX>), built in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">312 b.c.</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legions</ENAMEX> who marched to coastal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brindisi</ENAMEX> to set sail for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>. On either side
        lie the ruins of sepulchres of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of patrician <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel of Domine Quo Vadis</ENAMEX> marks the site where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>, fleeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nero‚</ENAMEX>Äôs persecution in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, is said to have encountered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>. Farther along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Appia</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most celebrated
        catacombs, including those of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Callisto</ENAMEX>, the largest of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 50</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">underground Christian</ENAMEX> cemeteries.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX>
        The power of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> endures both in the spirituality evoked
        by every stone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica</ENAMEX> and in the almost physical awe
        inspired by the splendors of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vatican City</ENAMEX>. At their best, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardinals</ENAMEX> replaced military conquest by moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> and
        persuasion; at their worst, they could show the same hunger for
        political power and worldly wealth as any caesar or grand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duke</ENAMEX>. A visit
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> is an object lesson for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sceptic</ENAMEX> alike.
        Named after the hill on which it stands and which in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Middle Ages</TIMEX> was surrounded by a malarial swamp, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> has been a
        papal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 600 years</TIMEX>, but a sovereign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> independent
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> only since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Lateran Treaty</ENAMEX> signed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>.
        If you have the time, try to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican Museums</ENAMEX> on separate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> to avoid fatigue and visual
        overload. Check opening times: it is anyone‚Äôs guess if the generously
        extended <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jubilee Year 2000</ENAMEX> will be kept in effect.
        To appreciate the unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">panorama</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚</ENAMEX>Äôs Basilica
        and its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 sq km piazza</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 sq mile</NUMEX>), approach it by foot as history‚Äôs
        countless pilgrims have. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX> at the beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sant‚ÄôAngelo Bridge</ENAMEX>, one
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> crossing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiber River</ENAMEX>. Adorned by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> angel sculptures by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">studio</ENAMEX>, it arrives at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo</ENAMEX>,
        originally built as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hadrian‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mausoleum</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 139</TIMEX>. Its name derives
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope Gregory‚Äôs</ENAMEX> vision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archangel Michael‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnow</ENAMEX> represented
        by a statue on top‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇheralding the end of a plague in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">590</TIMEX>. It was
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">barbarians</ENAMEX> who commandeered the massive round brick pile
        as a fortress, using ancient statues as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> to hurl on the heads
        of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> below. Linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX> by a thick-walled
        passage, it served as a hideout for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX> in times of danger, notably
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pope Clement VII</ENAMEX>, who holed up here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> during the sack of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Habsburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1527</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Papal Apartments</ENAMEX> are a
        strong contrast to the dungeons, both open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, where
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">philosopher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giordano Bruno</ENAMEX> and sculptor-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">goldsmith Benvenuto</ENAMEX>
        Cellini were once imprisoned.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter‚Äôs Square</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piazza San Pietro</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini</ENAMEX> has
        performed one of the world‚Äôs most exciting pieces of architectural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">orchestration</ENAMEX>. The sweeping curves of the colonnades reach out to the
        unending stream of pilgrims from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> itself and the whole world, urbi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> orbi, to take them into the bosom of the church beyond. In a rare
        opportunity for concentrated effort by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on such a gigantic
        project, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini</ENAMEX> completed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">284</NUMEX> travertine columns, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> pilasters,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just 11 years</TIMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1656 to 1667</TIMEX>.
        Stand on either of the circular paving stones set between the square‚Äôs
        twin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> fountains and the red granite <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> obelisk to
        appreciate the harmony of the quadruple rows of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doric</ENAMEX> columns, so
        perfectly aligned that they seem like a single row. The purity of
        Bernini‚Äôs work here refutes the popular conception of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX> as being
        nothing but overblown extravagance.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica</ENAMEX> is the largest of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX> and by any standards a grandiose achievement, but it
        inevitably suffered from the competing visions of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX>
        called in to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">collaborate‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇBramante</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliano da Sangallo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX>,

        often with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> looking over his shoulder.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1506 to 1626</TIMEX>, it changed from the simple ground plan
        of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> cross, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> arms of equal length, as favored by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bramante</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch-enemy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>, to the final form of
        Maderno‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> cross extended by a long nave, as demanded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counter-Reformation</ENAMEX>. One result is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maderno‚</ENAMEX>Äôs porticoed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> and nave obstruct a clear view of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelangelo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">square</ENAMEX>.
        The church‚Äôs dimensions are impressive: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">212 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">695 ft</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exterior</ENAMEX> length, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">187 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">613 ft</ENAMEX>) inside length; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">132 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">435 ft</ENAMEX>) to the
        tip of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> (diameter <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">42.45 m/139 ft</NUMEX>).
        As you go in, notice the keys of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">inlaid</ENAMEX> in the
        doorway paving. Set in the floor by the central door is the large round
        slab of red porphyry where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlemagne</ENAMEX> knelt for his coronation as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 800</TIMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You‚Äôll</ENAMEX> find the basilica‚Äôs most treasured work of art,

        Beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs great baldacchino (canopy),
        cast out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bronze</ENAMEX> beams taken from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantheon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs porch (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>),
        soars above the high altar. It was built right over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Peter‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb
        and reserved exclusively for the pope‚Äôs mass. In the apse beyond, the
        Baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> gives full vent to his exuberance with his bronze and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marble Cathedra</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX>, throne of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apostle‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX>.
        It should come as no surprise that, as the greatest patron
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>, sculptors, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> have ever known, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> should <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, one of the world‚Äôs richest
        collections of art. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 miles</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> of the

        If you want at all costs to avoid the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sistine‚</ENAMEX>Äôs day-long

        With the booty from the ruthless dismantling of ancient
        monuments to make way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pio-Clementino Museum</ENAMEX> has assembled a wonderful collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> art. Most celebrated is the tortured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laoco√∂n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhodes</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">century b.c. ‚Äìfirst century a.d.</ENAMEX> ), only recently returned more
        closely to its pristine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by the removal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> statue‚Äôs
        outstretched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> added by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-zealous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äúrestorers‚Äù</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope Julius II</ENAMEX> took a calculated risk in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1508</TIMEX> when he
        called in a relatively untried <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26-year-old</TIMEX> to do the interior
        decoration of his new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>. The result was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael Rooms</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanze di Raffaello</ENAMEX>). In the central <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanza della Segnatura</ENAMEX> are the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> masterly frescoes, Dispute over the Holy Sacrament and the famous
        School of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, confronting theological with philosophical wisdom.
        The Dispute unites biblical figures with historical pillars of the
        faith such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope Gregory</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Aquinas</ENAMEX>, but also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fra</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angelico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">divine Dante</ENAMEX>. At the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX> is
        believed to have given the red-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plato</ENAMEX> the features of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da</ENAMEX>
        Vinci, while portraying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> as the thoughtful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heraclitus</ENAMEX>,
        seated in the foreground. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raphael</ENAMEX> himself appears in the lower
        right-hand corner.
        In stark contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raphael‚Äôs</ENAMEX> grand manner, seek out the
        gentle beauty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fra Angelico‚</ENAMEX>Äôs frescoes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chapel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas V</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cappella del Beato Angelico</ENAMEX>). The lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen</ENAMEX>
        are depicted in delicately subdued pinks and blues.
        The richly decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borgia Apartments</ENAMEX> contain
        Pinturicchio‚Äôs frescoes with portraits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Borgia Pope</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander VI</ENAMEX> and his notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cesare</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucrezia</ENAMEX>, and
        leads into the collection of modern religious artwork opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul VI</ENAMEX>. The latter includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodin</ENAMEX> bronzes, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Picasso ceramics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matisse‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> sketches, and designs for ecclesiastical robes and, rather
        unexpectedly, a grotesque <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Bacon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>.
        But nothing can prepare you for the visual shock of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sistine Chapel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cappella Sistina</ENAMEX>), built for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sixtus IV</ENAMEX> in the 15th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. Restored to its original colors after a controversial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-year</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restoration</ENAMEX> finished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the brightness and freshness of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frescoes</ENAMEX> is overwhelming. Despite the distraction of the constant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crowds</ENAMEX> (quiet is requested), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> seem to yield to the power of
        Michelangelo‚Äôs ceiling, and his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Judgement</TIMEX> (restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>). The
        other wall frescoes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botticelli, Pinturicchio, Ghirlandaio</ENAMEX>, and
        Signorelli are barely given attention. In this private papal chapel,
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinals</ENAMEX> hold their conclave to elect a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX>, the glory of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Church</ENAMEX> achieves its finest artistic expression.
        The chapel portrays nothing less than the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> parts: from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Noah</ENAMEX>; the giving of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Law</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>; and
        from the birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Judgment</ENAMEX>. Toward the center of
        Michelangelo‚Äôs ceiling, you‚Äôll make out the celebrated outstretched
        finger of man‚Äôs creation, filled out by the drunkenness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noah</ENAMEX>, the
        turmoil of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flood</ENAMEX>. But most overwhelming of all is the impression of
        the whole‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbest appreciated looking back from the bench by the
        chapel‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exit</ENAMEX>.
        On the chapel‚Äôs altar wall is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelangelo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tempestuous
        Last <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judgment</ENAMEX>, begun <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 years</TIMEX> after the ceiling‚Äôs completion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1512</TIMEX>,
        when he was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> and imbued with deep religious soul-searching. An almost
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">naked Jesus</ENAMEX> dispenses justice more like a stern, even fierce Classical
        god-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> than the conventionally gentle biblical figure. It is said
        that the artist‚Äôs agonizing self-portrait can be made out in the flayed
        skin of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Bartholomew</ENAMEX>, to the right below <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>.
        Amid all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican‚</ENAMEX>Äôs treasures, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picture Gallery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinacoteca Vaticana</ENAMEX>), in a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX>, get short shrift. This collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> centuries of
        paintings includes important works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giotto, Fra Angelico, Perugino</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raphael‚Äôs Transfiguration</ENAMEX> (his last great work), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unfinished St. Jerome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellini‚Äôs Piet√†</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Caravaggio‚Äôs Descent</ENAMEX> from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross</ENAMEX>.
        The neighborhood south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trastevere</ENAMEX>,
        literally ‚Äúacross the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiber,‚Äù</ENAMEX> has long been renowned as the most
        popular quarter of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. Here, ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that consider themselves
        the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> uphold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age-old</TIMEX> traditions and customs (much like
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockneys</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>). It is good to wander among the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
        and markets to sample the authentic life of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, highlighted by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Noantri (‚ÄúWe Others‚Äù</ENAMEX>) street festival of music, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fireworks</ENAMEX>, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two weeks of July</TIMEX>. Another sort of festival
        atmosphere prevails every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Porta Portese</ENAMEX> section of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trastevere</ENAMEX> hosts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs liveliest and largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market. The stalls
        are filled with everything from vintage clothing to the occasional
        valuable antique.
        Inevitably, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">‚Äúpopular‚Äù and ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù</ENAMEX> became chic and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ambience</ENAMEX> is now somewhat contested by higher rents and the change in
        character that guarantees. But the true Trasteverini hang on, mainly in
        the area immediately around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Maria</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trastevere</ENAMEX>, reputedly the
        oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> may date back to the third
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, but the present <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> is the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope Innocent II</ENAMEX>,
        himself a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trasteverino</ENAMEX>, around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1140</TIMEX>. It is known for its wonderful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>-influenced fa√ßade and the interior‚Äôs pavements and mosaic of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> enthroned with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> decorating the domed ceiling of the apse. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liveliest fruit</ENAMEX> and vegetable market is to be found on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza di San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosimato</ENAMEX>.
        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museums</ENAMEX>
        The largest collection of Etruscan art in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> can be
        found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Villa Giulia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwest</ENAMEX> area of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Borghese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. Room after room is filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> from the
        tombs of this little understood pre-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>: shields, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chariots</ENAMEX>; exquisite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and silver jewelry; and decorative ceramic
        works. The museum‚Äôs highlight is a life-size, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth-century</TIMEX> b.c.
        terracotta sculpture of a reclining <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> that was used as the lid of
        a sarcophagus.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borghese Gallery</ENAMEX>, opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> after an extensive
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-year</TIMEX> renovation, is housed in a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque villa</ENAMEX> inspired
        originally by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadrian‚Äôs Villa</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tivoli</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69</NUMEX>), but with its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> formal gardens now transformed into an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>-style landscaped
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs loveliest and most important small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, its
        highlights include some outstanding sculptures by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernini</ENAMEX> and Canova
        (whose portrayal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> as a reclining <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX> is arguably
        the museum‚Äôs most famous attraction), as well as paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX>,
        Correggio, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titian, Caravaggio, Botticelli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D√ºrer</ENAMEX>, and

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capitoline Museums</ENAMEX>, in the twin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campidoglio</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>), have extensive collections of sculpture
        excavated from ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, particularly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Nuovo</ENAMEX>. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo dei Conservatori</ENAMEX> is the most celebrated piece, the superb
        Etruscan bronze <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capitoline She-Wolf</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lupa Capitolina</ENAMEX>), symbol of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The wolf dates from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. , but the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">little Romulus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remus</ENAMEX> that she is suckling are actually <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>
        additions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pollaiuolo</ENAMEX>. The top-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitoline Picture Gallery</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinacoteca Capitolina</ENAMEX>) has important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellini</ENAMEX>,
        Titian, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tintoretto, Lotto</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veronese</ENAMEX>, as well as a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romulus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caravaggio‚Äôs St. John the Baptist</ENAMEX>.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arch-rivals</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borromini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernini</ENAMEX>, is worth a visit as much for its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">splendid Baroque</ENAMEX> d√©cor as for its collection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th‚Äì17th-century</TIMEX>
        paintings. They come together in the palace‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salone</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Hall</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pietro da Cortona‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dazzling illusionist ceiling fresco, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Triumph</ENAMEX> of

        triptych, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raphael‚Äôs La Fornarina</ENAMEX> (though the authorship is disputed),
        and works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titian, Tintoretto</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX>.
        New on the scene is the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Doria Pamphili</ENAMEX> off the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza Venezia</ENAMEX>. The private collection of the important <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doria</ENAMEX> family

        Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Churches</ENAMEX>
        It‚Äôs impossible to even count all of the delightful
        churches worth visiting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> (unofficial counts hover at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">250</ENAMEX>), many
        of which are commonly stumbled on by accident. We suggest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just three</NUMEX>

        is the largest and most splendid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> dedicated to the

        forget the binoculars), and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">triumphant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> enthroned in
        the apse over the high altar. The coffered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> ceiling glitters
        with the gold of the first shipments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX>.
        In a nearby side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Prassede</ENAMEX> is unprepossessing
        from the outside but enchanting in the intimacy of its interior. The

        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Zeno</ENAMEX> the city‚Äôs most important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> monument. To the right
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">chapel</ENAMEX> is a fragment of rare jasper said to come from the column
        to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> was tied for his flagellation. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice the</ENAMEX> fine mosaic of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jerusalem</ENAMEX> over the chancel.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San Pietro</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vincoli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Chains</ENAMEX>) might not

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius II‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>, the statue of the great biblical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> sits in
        awesome majesty. You can imagine how grandiose the original plan must
        have been when you realize that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> was supposed to be one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
        figures adorning the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúhorns‚Äù</ENAMEX> on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> continue a
        traditional medieval mistranslation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</ENAMEX> for halo-like rays of
        light. On each side, the comparatively passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacob‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX>, a prayerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachel</ENAMEX> and melancholy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leah</ENAMEX>, were the last completed

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acres</ENAMEX>), this retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hideaway</ENAMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor-builder</ENAMEX> was
        designed to recapture some of the architectural marvels of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>,
        especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> he loved above all else‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa travel notebook for

        and mosaic fragments in gardens running wild among the olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
        cypresses, and pines can be marvelously evocative of a lost world. To
        get a clear sense of the original, start with the villa‚Äôs excellent
        scale model. The monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>, separate <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Latin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> theater, temples, and pavilions together make up the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who drew no distinction between the pleasures of mind and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. In
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the enchanting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa ¬≠dell‚ÄôIsola</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> surrounded by
        a little reflecting pool and circular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX>, epitomizes all the magic
        of the place.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tivoli</ENAMEX> itself, overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> plain, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa</ENAMEX>
        d‚ÄôEste is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX>, celebrating all the extravagance

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> can look down at the terraced gardens, the real reason for

        The region immediately southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> is known locally
        as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castelli Romani</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman Castles</ENAMEX>) for the fortified hilltop
        refuges built during the medieval civil wars. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it‚Äôs just the

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Alban hills</ENAMEX> and lakes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frascati</ENAMEX>,
        Grottaferrata, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marino</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocca di Papa</ENAMEX> make delightful stops, not
        least of all for a cool glass of their white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, especially during
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> grape-harvest festivals. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pope</ENAMEX> has his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> palace at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castel Gandolfo</ENAMEX>, on the shores of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Albano</ENAMEX>. As his health is

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarquinia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Lazio</ENAMEX>
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">A12</NUMEX> autostrada and the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Aurelia</ENAMEX> (which ends up
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arles</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Provence</ENAMEX>) take you to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarquinia</ENAMEX>. Most important of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> in its heyday of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth centuries b.c. Today</TIMEX>, the
        paintings and sculptures found in its necropolis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 5,700</NUMEX> tombs
        provide fascinating evidence of the brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Etruscan</ENAMEX> civilization for
        archeology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX>. Visits to the tombs outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> are organized

        Gothic-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Palazzo Vitelleschi</ENAMEX> as you enter Tarquinia. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> exhibits sarcophagi, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruscan</ENAMEX> and imported <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> vases, and some

        sculpture from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarquinia‚Äôs Ara della Regina Temple</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuscania</ENAMEX> is a quiet little fortified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, recovering now

        and a crypt built on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruscan</ENAMEX> and ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> pillars. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX>

        In the restful charm of its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval quarters</ENAMEX>, Viterbo
        makes a good overnight stop. The oldest neighborhood, with narrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and little market squares, is around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via San Pellegrino</ENAMEX>. On
        the equally attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza San Lorenzo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Papale</ENAMEX> has an

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sardinia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sardegna</ENAMEX>)
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mediterranean‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sicily</ENAMEX> being
        the largest) is worth a vacation all to itself‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand much more detailed
        treatment than follows. Those curious to get a feel for its atmosphere
        (rarely first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>) should consider summertime stays
        at small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">seaside resorts</ENAMEX> (off-season visits will fail to capture its
        allure), meandering drives along its impressive coastline, and a couple
        of excursions into the little-visited hinterland.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prehistoric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> dotted the island with his mysterious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cone</ENAMEX>-shaped nuraghi <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and watchtowers before it was colonized by
        Cretans, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenicians, Carthaginians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>. Later, the island
        became part of the commercial empires <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">of Pisa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genoa</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>,
        and was annexed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1718</TIMEX> by the dukes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy</ENAMEX>. Malarial <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> and
        repressive feudalism restrained the island‚Äôs development until the 19th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>. Since then it has undergone a rapid industrialization balanced
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by renewal of its cattle farming. Its environmentally-sensitive
        development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Smeralda</ENAMEX> is a mecca for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs yachting set

        Cagliari
        The island‚Äôs capital and main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> is a largely modern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, but with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> flavor to its older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> up on the hill.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> includes important bronze statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">warriors</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> found in prehistoric tombs. The much renovated cathedral
        has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> superbly carved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pulpits</ENAMEX>, originally commissioned
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pisa</ENAMEX>. Before heading for the open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, try the
        excellent local cuisine, including both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-style <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stews</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Genoese</ENAMEX> pasta dishes.
        The winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cagliari-Muravera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> across the plunging
        ravines of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sarrabus mountains</ENAMEX> to the coast is one of the most
        spectacular drives on the whole island.
        Continue up the coast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanusei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> inland across
        the rugged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gennargentu mountains</ENAMEX>, covered with dense forests of cork
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oak</ENAMEX> and chestnut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Farther north, just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nuoro</ENAMEX>-Dorgali road
        is the secluded site of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra Orrios</ENAMEX>, a well-preserved prehistoric
        village (signposted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villaggio Nuragico</ENAMEX>). A short walk along a marked
        path through the fields takes you to a group of drystone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> temples and circular ramparts in a lovely setting of eucalyptus and
        olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Archaeologists have located <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 7,000</NUMEX> of these nuraghi
        structures around the island, most of them flattened cone towers
        believed to be parts of fortified citadels.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Costa</ENAMEX> Smeralda
        The glittering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Emerald Coast</ENAMEX> on the northeast tip of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">island</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs smartest resort areas, with beautiful beaches,
        five-star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, sports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, and exclusive marinas for yachts
        and motor launches. It stretches around bays and rocky inlets from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olbia</ENAMEX> in the east to the promontory of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Maddalena</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porto Cervo</ENAMEX> is the coast‚Äôs fashionable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, but Baia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sardinia</ENAMEX> competes with its craggy coastline. More exclusive is the
        little luxury resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Maddalena</ENAMEX>, a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-minute</TIMEX> ferry-ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palau</ENAMEX>. It is in fact the principal island of
        an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archipelago</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>, most of them little more than piles of rocks.
        Linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Maddalena</ENAMEX> by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7‚Äìkm</NUMEX>- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4‚Äìmile-</ENAMEX>) long causeway,

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where he died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1882</TIMEX> (his tomb is nearby) is now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> was never finished, its interior of a noble simplicity. Some of
        the pillars come from an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corinthian</ENAMEX>

        This quiet little seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northwest</ENAMEX> coast
        has a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> flavor to its older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> around the

        ramparts.
        There‚Äôs good fishing to be had in the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bay</ENAMEX> of Porto
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conte</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palmavera</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nuraghi citadel</ENAMEX> is well worth a visit. On the

        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neptune‚Äôs Grotto</ENAMEX>). Guided tours of these subterranean caverns with

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TUSCANY</ENAMEX> AND UMBRIA
        Light is the secret of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuscany‚</ENAMEX>Äôs magic. In that apparently
        miraculous collision of imagination and intellect that sparked the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> had
        the constant inspiration of the dramatic changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tuscan</ENAMEX> light from
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn to dusk</TIMEX>. And more than anywhere else in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany</ENAMEX> and
        neighboring land-locked Umbria present the ideal green Italian
        landscape, dotted with stalwart <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, where cypress-tree
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sentinels</ENAMEX> watch over groves of twisted olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>
        blanket the gentle rolling hills.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence</ENAMEX> lies at the heart of the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Apennines</ENAMEX>, in a
        basin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arno</ENAMEX> river which runs out to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pisa</ENAMEX> and the sea. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siena</ENAMEX>, its
        proud historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX>, dominates the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuscan hill</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to the south,
        while the university <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perugia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assisi of St. Francis</ENAMEX> are
        the keys to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umbria‚</ENAMEX>Äôs luminous beauty.
        With some careful timing, modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can capture a
        glimpse of that miracle of light. Arrive <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> for your
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> look across the hills from the grey-stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Gimignano</ENAMEX>
        (a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúmedieval Manhattan‚Äù</ENAMEX>), or come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siena‚Äôs Piazza del Campo</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sunset</ENAMEX>. The dazzling white marble of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pisa‚Äôs Duomo</ENAMEX> and leaning campanile
        is most breathtaking in the noonday sun, but late afternoon is the
        blessed moment for the brilliant mosaic fa√ßade of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orvieto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firenze</ENAMEX>)
        Despite the dead heat and humidity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence</ENAMEX>,
        with the magnificence of its monuments and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, it is packed
        nonetheless. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more reserved and less seductive than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nea¬≠po¬≠¬≠litans</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>. This said, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> remains one
        of the world‚Äôs great tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">meccas</ENAMEX> and boasts a panoply of
        architecture, history, and artwork in quantities not to be found
        elsewhere in the world.
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">itineraries</ENAMEX> divide the city‚Äôs heart into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">quarters</ENAMEX>: from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo</ENAMEX> north to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>; from the Piazza
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">della Signoria</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Vecchio</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Uffizi Galleries</ENAMEX> east to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Santa Croce</ENAMEX>; from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mercato Nuovo west to Piazza Santa Maria</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novella</ENAMEX>; and the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">‚ÄúLeft Bank‚</ENAMEX>Äù of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arno River</ENAMEX> around the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitti Palace</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazzale Michelangelo</ENAMEX>.
        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>), officially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Maria del Fiore</ENAMEX>,
        proclaims the inordinate but certainly justified civic pride of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florentines</ENAMEX>. The very heart of the city‚Äôs centro storico, it was begun
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1296</TIMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnolfo di Cambio</ENAMEX>, although the imposing green, white,
        and rose marble neo-Gothic fa√ßade was completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only six centuries</TIMEX>
        later.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of its glories is the free-standing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">campanile</ENAMEX>,
        designed by the multi-talented <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giotto</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>-m- (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">267-ft-</ENAMEX>) tall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bell</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> (it‚Äôs a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">414</NUMEX>-stair climb to the top) is decorated on its
        lower sections by hexagonal bas-reliefs sculpted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Pisano</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luca della Robbia</ENAMEX>, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giotto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs drawings. Characteristic of the
        city‚Äôs civic consciousness, they portray the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Life of Man</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adam‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        creation to the rise of civilization through the arts and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sciences‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmusic</ENAMEX>, architecture, metallurgy, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">like‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpursued</ENAMEX> so

        Originals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donatello‚</ENAMEX>Äôs sculpture are kept in the cathedral‚Äôs own

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelangelo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs unfinished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piet√†.</ENAMEX> The dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> in his
        mother‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> emphasizes the agony rather than the pathos portrayed by

        conceived the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> and represented himself in the figure
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicodemus</ENAMEX>. Flaws in the marble so enraged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> that he hurled
        a hammer at it, destroying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ‚Äôs</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">leg‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> has been
        restored and the rather insipid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Magdalen</ENAMEX> was later added by a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pupil</ENAMEX>.
        Brunelleschi‚Äôs masterpiece, the cathedral‚Äôs grandiose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terra</ENAMEX>-cotta cupola, with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone ribs curving</ENAMEX> to the
        marble lantern at the top, is the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">symbol</ENAMEX>, visible not only all
        over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> but also from far beyond in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tuscan hills</ENAMEX>. Completed
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1436</TIMEX>, it measures <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">45.5 m</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">149 ft</ENAMEX>) in diameter. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">463</NUMEX> steps to its
        top climb in comfortable stages to reveal a panorama of the surrounding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, different views of the cathedral‚Äôs interior, and fascinating
        close-ups of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome‚Äôs structure</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX> frescoes
        restored in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. Begun by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giorgio Vasari</ENAMEX> and finished by his pupil
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Zuccari</ENAMEX>, it is the world‚Äôs largest depiction of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last</TIMEX>
        Supper. (Brunelleschi‚Äôs original wooden model of the cupola is
        displayed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cathedral museum</ENAMEX>. ) Look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghiberti‚</ENAMEX>Äôs bronze shrine
        below the high altar, as well as his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stained-glass windows on the
        entrance wall. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bay</ENAMEX> on the north aisle is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paolo Uccello‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        statue-like equestrian painting of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> mercenary

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acuto</ENAMEX>).
        The octagonal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> baptistery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovanni</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX>) is celebrated as the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>,
        and for the magnificent bas-reliefs of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sets of bronze doors.
        The oldest, facing south and telling the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John the Baptist</ENAMEX>,
        were designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Pisano</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1330</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A century later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghiberti</ENAMEX> won the competition to design the great north and east doors,
        devoted respectively to the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> and scenes from the Old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Testament</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> said the latter, facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo</ENAMEX>, were good
        enough to adorn the entrance to heaven and they have been known ever
        since as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Doors of Paradise</ENAMEX>. Among the losing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> was Filippo
        Brunelleschi, who thereafter devoted himself entirely to architecture.
        (In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bargello</ENAMEX>, you can compare his bronze model with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghiberti‚Äôs</ENAMEX>; see
        page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Magnificent Byzantine</ENAMEX>-style mosaics inside the cupola include

        date from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th century</TIMEX>.
        The might of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medici</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> can be sensed in their
        massive palazzo, northwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Cavour</ENAMEX>, the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palazzo Medici-Riccardi</ENAMEX>. Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äôs prefecture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, the formidable edifice set the style for the city‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floor</ENAMEX> originally had an open loggia at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corner</ENAMEX> for the family banking business. Don‚Äôt miss the upstairs
        chapel for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benozzo Gozzoli‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> fresco of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Journey of the</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magi</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX>. It portrays the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Medici</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clan</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> the
        Magnificent in what is in fact an allegory of an ecumenical council
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope Pius II</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medici</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> lived here until
        moving to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Vecchio</ENAMEX> and eventually the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Pitti</ENAMEX>.
        Around the corner is the family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Lorenzo</ENAMEX>
        designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brunelleschi</ENAMEX> before he designed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cupola. Funds
        ran out before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelangelo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> planned fa√ßade could embellish the
        austere <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX>-like exterior. Inside, you‚Äôll see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medici</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> arms
        set in the floor in front of the altar. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brunelleschi</ENAMEX> is at his most
        elegant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old Sacristy</ENAMEX> at the end of the left transept (site of a
        few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Medici</ENAMEX> tombs), decorated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Donatello</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>-medallions (the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> himself is buried in the left transept). Adjacent to the church
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laurentian Library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblioteca Laurenziana</ENAMEX>), commissioned in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1524</TIMEX> and most known for the graceful cloisters and monumental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX>-designed stairway.
        Adjoining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> but with a separate outdoor entrance
        in the back are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici Chapels</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cappelle Medicee</ENAMEX>), monuments to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">splendor</ENAMEX> and decadence of the family dynasty. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Princes‚Äô Chapel</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cappella dei Principi</ENAMEX>) is a piece of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque bombast</ENAMEX> in
        flamboyant multi-colored marbles, for which the altar was not
        completed, appropriately enough, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX>. The summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici</ENAMEX> power
        is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michelangelo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs superb <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Sacristy</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacrestia Nuova</ENAMEX>), a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-man show of his unparalleled talents that he worked on from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1521‚Äì1534</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo the Magnificent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliano</ENAMEX> lie in simple
        tombs beneath the sculptor‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX>, flanked by lesser

        Michelangelo‚Äôs greatest work here is reserved for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> minor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of

        more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior</ENAMEX>-like above figures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Night</ENAMEX> (female) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX> (male). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church of San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> finds itself surrounded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of stalls
        that make up the open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercato San Lorenzo</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest
        tourist markets offering good finds and competitive prices.
        It‚Äôs an easy walk to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monastery of San Marco</ENAMEX>, an evocative setting for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> largely

        who lived here as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monk</ENAMEX>. Off the cloister, with its ancient cedar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilgrim‚Äôs Hospice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ospizio dei Pelligrini</ENAMEX>) where some of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus Mocked</ENAMEX> in cell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. In the small refectory is the important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghirlandaio</ENAMEX> mural of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Supper</ENAMEX>, a subject traditionally found in
        monastic dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Prior‚Äôs Quarters</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dormitory</ENAMEX>

        Signoria, now substituted by a life-size copy), provides the perfect
        object lesson of the finished product, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hero</ENAMEX> infused with all the
        contained energy needed to hurl that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goliath</ENAMEX>. Perhaps the most
        famous piece of sculpture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> world, it was carved from a
        discarded defective column of marble by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> when he was just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Sant issima Annunziata</ENAMEX>, Brunelleschi
        produced a consummate piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> urban planning, a pioneering
        example of the piazza as stage-set. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1440s</TIMEX> he designed the
        gracefully arched loggia and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ospedale degli Innocenti</ENAMEX>, the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> for foundlings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>; swaddled babes are the subject of

        and equestrian statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Grand Duke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinando</ENAMEX>, preserve the harmonies

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ospedale</ENAMEX> in the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via della Colonna</ENAMEX> and the Museo
        Archeologico, whose important collection of ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Piazza della Signoria to Piazza Santa</ENAMEX> Croce
        Flanked by some of the city‚Äôs most stylish fashion

        If the tall rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orsanmichele</ENAMEX> looks to you
        more like a grain silo than the church it‚Äôs supposed to be, that‚Äôs
        because it has been used as both. Formerly an open loggia, it was
        rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 14th century</TIMEX> as a market, and then as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1380</TIMEX> converting its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gothic</ENAMEX> arches to the present ground-floor windows,
        and adding a granary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX>. The fortress-like exterior is decorated
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> niches: to fill them, the major guilds commissioned statues of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saints</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest talents (replicas now stand in

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza della Signoria</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äôs civic and social

        since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1299</TIMEX>, the square bustles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all seasons</TIMEX>, not least because it
        leads to the richest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy‚Äôs</ENAMEX> art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uffizi</ENAMEX>. At the south

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medusa</ENAMEX>. In one inspired moment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> braggart has combined
        the legendary technical wizardry he loved to show off as a goldsmith
        with undeniable sculptural beauty.
        Also in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loggia</ENAMEX>, the spiralling Rape of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabines of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giambologna</ENAMEX> (actually a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean de Boulogne</ENAMEX>) is
        another piece of dazzling virtuosity, donated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici</ENAMEX>.

        which always made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici</ENAMEX> uneasy with its theme of a tyrant

        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Michelangelo‚Äôs magnificent David</ENAMEX>; this life-size copy was placed here
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1873</TIMEX>. Standing against a hostile world of cruel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philistines</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florentines</ENAMEX> loved to identify with the beauty and courage of the poetic
        young <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX>.
        A commemorative plaque (near the Baroque fountain)
        embedded in the piazza marks the spot where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savonarola</ENAMEX> was executed
        (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>).
        In gentle contrast to the austere <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> Gothic exterior
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Vecchio</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnolfo di Cambio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasari</ENAMEX> added ornate stucco and frescoes to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>
        for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici</ENAMEX> wedding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1560s</TIMEX> (the palazzo served briefly as a
        Medici <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> until they moved across the river to the Palazzo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitti</ENAMEX>). A copy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verrocchio‚</ENAMEX>Äôs delightful bronze cherub tops the
        porphyry fountain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Upstairs</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salone dei</ENAMEX> Cinquecento
        was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1495</TIMEX> for the short-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florentine Republic</ENAMEX> before
        serving as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke Cosimo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs throne <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three centuries later</TIMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber of Italy‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parliament</ENAMEX>. The d√©cor celebrates

        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hall of the Lilies</ENAMEX>) is brilliantly decorated in blues and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">golds</ENAMEX> with
        Florentine heraldry and vivid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ghirlandaio</ENAMEX> frescoes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> history. It adjoins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chancery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancelleria</ENAMEX>) where Niccol√≤
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macchiavelli</ENAMEX> served as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florentine Republic</ENAMEX>. Any

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uffizi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> painting
        stretches in a long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX>-shape from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Vecchio</ENAMEX> down to the Arno
        river and back. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke Cosimo</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vasari</ENAMEX> design it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1560</TIMEX> as a series of
        government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> (hence its name), a mint for the city‚Äôs florin, and
        workshops for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">craftsmen</ENAMEX>. Vasari‚Äôs greatest architectural

        important art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>.
        Lines requiring achingly-long waits are commonplace
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">year-round</ENAMEX>. Tickets can now be reserved in advance (inquire at your

        an occasional peek out the window over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ponte Vecchio</ENAMEX>, and
        recharge your batteries at the museum‚Äôs newly reopened caf√© above the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loggia dei Lanzi</ENAMEX>. It has lovely views of the piazza.
        Reorganization makes it hazardous to specify room numbers,
        but the paintings are generally exhibited chronologically from the 13th
        to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th century</TIMEX>. Here are some of the highlights:
        Giotto breathes a warm humanity into his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna Enthroned</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1310</TIMEX>) that distinguishes it from the more formal pictures of the
        subject by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cimabue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duccio</ENAMEX> in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. See also Giotto‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> polyptych. Some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annunciation</ENAMEX> triptych of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simone Martini</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> shying away from archangel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabriel</ENAMEX>, has the
        characteristic elegance and poetry of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Siena</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paolo Uccello</ENAMEX> shows a dream-like, almost surrealist
        obsession with his (unsolved) problems of perspective and
        merry-go-round <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Romano</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1456</TIMEX>). It contrasts
        with the cool dignity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piero della Francesca</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federigo da</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montefeltro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Battista</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1465</TIMEX>), portrayed against their Urbino
        landscape.
        Some of the museum‚Äôs most visited <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are to come: In
        his graceful <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Allegory of Spring</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1478</TIMEX>) and the almost too famous but
        undyingly delightful Birth of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botticelli</ENAMEX> achieves an enchanting
        mixture of sensuality and purity. His <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hugo</ENAMEX> van der
        Goes is more down-to-earth in the realism of his huge triptych
        Adoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepherds</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1478</TIMEX>), which influenced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florentine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>
        like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ghirlandaio</ENAMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Baptism of Christ</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1470</TIMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verrocchio</ENAMEX>, you can see
        the earliest identified work of his most famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinci‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe</ENAMEX> background landscape and the angel on the left, beautiful
        enough to reduce his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> angel to wide-eyed jealousy. Leonardo‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annunciation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1472‚Äì1477</ENAMEX>) of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years later</TIMEX> already shows his
        characteristic gentle tone and feeling for precise detail, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adoration of the Magi</ENAMEX>, even as an underdrawing left unfinished by his
        departure for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1481</TIMEX>), reveals his revolutionary power of
        psychological observation.
        The northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> include a splendid <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Portrait of</ENAMEX>
        His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Father</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1490</TIMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albrecht D√ºrer</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1528</TIMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cranach</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Southwell</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Holbein</ENAMEX>; and a moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mater Dolorosa</ENAMEX>
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joos van Cleve</ENAMEX>.
        In the mystic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Allegory</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1490</TIMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Bellini</ENAMEX>, we
        can appreciate the typical Venetian serenity even without understanding
        its symbols.
        The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uffizi</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Family</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doni Tondo</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1504</TIMEX>), his only known panel painting (he was far better
        known for his frescoes and sculpture), decidedly sculptural in quality.
        Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelangelo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs strength and torment or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leonardo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs complexity,
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX>, brings his own
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">powers</ENAMEX> of clarity and restraint to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldfinch</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1505</TIMEX>)
        and a revealing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Self-Portrait</ENAMEX> made when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 23</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titian</ENAMEX> has a superbly sensual <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus of Urbino</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1538</TIMEX>), less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goddess</ENAMEX> than the prince‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mistress</ENAMEX> she probably was, and an
        equally disturbing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flora</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1515</TIMEX>; more works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titian</ENAMEX> can be
        found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Pitti</ENAMEX>). Some are also upset by the eroticism of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parmigianino</ENAMEX> in his strange but undeniably graceful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> with the
        Long <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neck</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1534)‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇjust</ENAMEX> look at those elongated fingers‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇa masterpiece
        of the sophisticated and subsequently decadent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mannerism</ENAMEX> that followed
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Renaissance</ENAMEX>.
        There is an intriguing ambiguity to the half-naked peasant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX> posing as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacchus</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caravaggio</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1589</TIMEX>), but nothing
        complicated about the robust sexiness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens Bacchanale</ENAMEX>. And
        compare Caravaggio‚Äôs mastery of chiaroscuro (the play of light and
        dark) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> of realism in his violent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1590</TIMEX>)
        with the more contemplative style of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX> in the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Rabbi</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1658</TIMEX>) and other portraits.

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1863</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Croce</ENAMEX> (east of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uffizi</ENAMEX>) has an important series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giotto</ENAMEX> frescoes. The pathos shines

        Crucifixion by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donatello</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1425</TIMEX>) is in affecting naturalistic contrast
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> idealism of the time.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is also revered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florentines</ENAMEX> as the last
        resting place of many great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galileo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machiavelli, Ghiberti</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rossini</ENAMEX> are all buried there. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb (right

        it out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florentine</ENAMEX>-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dante</ENAMEX>, they have to be content with
        a cenotaph, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ravenna</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">burial place</ENAMEX>, refuses to part with his
        remains (he was exiled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> for political reasons).
        At the back of the cloister of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Croce‚Äôs Franciscan</ENAMEX>

        Its spaciousness is enhanced by geometric patterns of dark stone

        with a dour bust of the master by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniele da Volterra</ENAMEX>. Michelangelo‚Äôs
        works here are numerous, including his early masterpiece The Drunken
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacchus</ENAMEX> (done when he was just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>), and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Virgin</ENAMEX> and Child marble

        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercato Nuovo</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Novella</ENAMEX>
        Start out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the heart of medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>,
        on the street named after the drapers‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">guild</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Calimala</ENAMEX>. Just
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">south</ENAMEX> of the caf√©-ringed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza della Repubblica</ENAMEX> is the covered Mercato
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuovo</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loggia</ENAMEX> once called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Straw Market</ENAMEX> because of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw products</ENAMEX> for which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> was known. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw items</ENAMEX> (bags,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placemats</ENAMEX>) are now made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, as are many of the other tourist
        tchotchkes on sale here. The selection of tourist mementos is
        interesting enough, but pales in comparison to the open-air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercato San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> just north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Duomo</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of the same name. The

        the south side of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercato Nuovo</ENAMEX>, is every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Florentine</ENAMEX> child‚Äôs
        favorite. They say that if you rub it‚Äôs burnished snout, and throw a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coin</ENAMEX> in the fountain, your wish for a return trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> will come
        true.
        West on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Porta Rossa</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX> Palazzo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davanzati</ENAMEX>; its stern, fortress-like exterior still provides rings at
        ground level for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tethering horses</ENAMEX> and on upper stories to hold torches
        and lanterns for festive occasions. Inside, on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor, is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> of typical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Florentine</ENAMEX> domestic life from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th</TIMEX> to 16th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>, with furniture, utensils, and ceramics‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe most attractive
        are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala dei Pappagalli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parrots‚Äô Hall</ENAMEX>) with its trompe l‚Äô≈ìil
        tapestries frescoed on the walls. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> of restoration, fall

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Trinita</ENAMEX> has a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late-16th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Baroque fa√ßade</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> interior. Ghirlandaio, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master teacher</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX>, decorated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sassetti Chapel</ENAMEX> (far right of the high

        on the altar is considered his masterpiece.
        Florence‚Äôs most elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> continue the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX> de‚Äô
        Tornabuoni‚Äôs centuries-old tradition of aristocratic luxury. On the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lanterns</ENAMEX>; the massive palazzo, once a private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>, is used for
        special exhibitions and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biennial</TIMEX> antique fair. West of here is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Via della Vigna Nuova</ENAMEX>, where the spill-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tornabuoni‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most

        The cavernous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican</ENAMEX> church of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Maria</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novella</ENAMEX> is the finest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äôs monastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Battista</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alberti</ENAMEX> added the graceful white-and-green marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fa√ßade</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1470</TIMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> is rich in artistic treasures, but its most prized, indeed one
        of the city‚Äôs greatest paintings for its early handling of perspective
        and depth, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masaccio Trinity</ENAMEX> (from around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1427</TIMEX>; left aisle, third
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bay</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> stand on either side of the crucified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> upheld

        the whole forming an inspiring triangle under the coffered ceiling of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> chapel.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> also boasts one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most delightful
        fresco cycles. Covering the chancel behind the main altar, the
        Ghirlandaio frescoes of the lives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX> kept the
        master‚Äôs entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">workshop</ENAMEX> busy from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1485 to 1490</TIMEX>. They were paid for by
        the prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tornabuoni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (his biblical scenes are peopled with
        portraits of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrons</ENAMEX> in the latest fashions of the time).

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brunelleschi Crucifixion</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1410</TIMEX>), his only scultpure in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX>, brings to

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of Santa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Novella</ENAMEX>, spare a glance at the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">workshops</ENAMEX> supplied them with hand-made marvels are still vibrant with
        the humming bottegas of today‚Äôs artisans.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross the Ponte Vecchio</ENAMEX> to the sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitti Palace</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Pitti</ENAMEX>), its dauntingly heavy and graceless fa√ßade belying the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ornate</ENAMEX> and colorful interior. After a brief stint living in the Palazzo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vecchio</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza della Signoria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke Cosimo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>,
        Eleonora of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>, acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> from the bankrupt Pitti
        merchant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1549</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici‚Äôs</ENAMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>; it was
        enlarged and embellished substantially over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>.
        Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> (following varying and
        erratic schedules with the exception of the largest and most reliable,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitti Gallery</ENAMEX>) take you into the rich world of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici</ENAMEX>, much as
        they left it. The important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitti Gallery</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galleria Palatina</ENAMEX>) is the
        family art collection. The paintings are displayed just as the dukes
        themselves hung them, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-high, by personal
        preference rather than in historical sequence. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> richly-decorated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salons</ENAMEX> (just a fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Medici</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>) are named after the
        themes of their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">frescoes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇVenus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prometheus</ENAMEX>,
        etc. As in any collection of family pictures, there‚Äôs a preponderance
        of portraits, though here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the aunts</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX> tend to be princesses,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardinals</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popes</ENAMEX>. It is the most important collection of paintings
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uffizi</ENAMEX>.
        And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici‚</ENAMEX>Äôs taste and means did permit a considerable
        number of masterpieces. Titian displays his masterly use of color and
        light in The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Concert</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall 5</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venus</ENAMEX>), a haunting portrait of The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Englishman</ENAMEX> and bare-breasted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magdalen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall 6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>).
        An early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of ‚Äúmake love, not war,<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äù Rubens</ENAMEX> shows
        Venus restraining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> in his vivid <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Consequences of War</ENAMEX> and portrays
        himself on the far left of his <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Four Philosophers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall 7</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX> is well represented by a stately <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Veiled Woman</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall 8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX>), a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maddalena Doni</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall 9</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saturn</ENAMEX>), deliberately imitating the pose of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vinci‚Äôs Mona Lisa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pregnant Women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iliad</ENAMEX>).
        Caravaggio contributes a typically disturbing canvas, an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ugly Sleeping Cupid</ENAMEX> with intimations of death (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hall</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX>).
        Up on the next floor, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Art Gallery</ENAMEX> (Galleria
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">d‚ÄôArte Moderna</ENAMEX>) is devoted to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19th- and 20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> art. Most
        interesting are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macchiaioli</ENAMEX> (from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">verb ‚Äúmacchiare</ENAMEX>,‚Äù to blotch
        or stain) school of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuscan</ENAMEX> pre-Impressionists, who met at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caff√® Michelangelo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1860s</TIMEX> seeking a new freedom from academic art
        that paralleled the political liberation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risorgimento</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giorgio</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Chirico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eduardo de Pisis</ENAMEX> are among the more important
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> exhibited. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 100</NUMEX> paintings
        were added to the collection.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pitti‚Äôs</ENAMEX> next-most visited <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX>, the Silverware
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo degli Argenti</ENAMEX>), occupies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> sumptuously decorated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>
        to offset the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Medici</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">family‚Äôs invaluable treasures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">porcelain</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baroque</ENAMEX> furniture. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carriage Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo</ENAMEX> delle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrozze</ENAMEX>), in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> on the far right of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apartments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appartamenti Monumentali</ENAMEX>), upstairs, right of the main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">entrance</ENAMEX>, show an opulent, truly palatial life that the palazzo‚Äôs dour
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exterior</ENAMEX> never lets you suspect. The restoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Costume Museum</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo del Costume</ENAMEX>), an unusual collection of traditional dress from
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18th‚</NUMEX>Äì20th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, is complete in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> for a rest in the shade of the cypresses, pines, and
        holm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> of the palace‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boboli Gardens</ENAMEX>, a favorite picnic destination
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>. To the modern eye, they form a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>
        theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> dotted with loggias, cool fountains, grottoes with
        artificial stalactites, and myriad statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gods</ENAMEX>, nymphs, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grotesques</ENAMEX> (derived from the word ‚Äúgrotto‚Äù).
        Directly behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amphitheatre</ENAMEX>, shaped like
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">circus</ENAMEX> and with lovely views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Pitti</ENAMEX> and the city
        beyond, was the scene of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medici‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most extravagant f√™tes and staged
        performances. In the middle of the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pond of Neptune</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasca del</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nettuno</ENAMEX>), the burly sea god wields his trident in petrified parody of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boboli‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardeners</ENAMEX>.
        After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitti‚</ENAMEX>Äôs riches, the unadorned white fa√ßade of
        the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Augustinian</ENAMEX> church of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santo Spirito</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Santo Spirito</ENAMEX>)
        is a sobering antidote. Brunelleschi‚Äôs design was never completed but
        the interior preserves the spatial clarity of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Corinthian</ENAMEX>-capitaled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colonnades</ENAMEX>. In the right transept is a strikingly theatrical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>
        Enthroned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filippino Lippi</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria del Carmine</ENAMEX> is an essential stop
        on any artistic pilgrimage to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> itself is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unprepossessing reconstruction</ENAMEX> after a devastating fire of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1771</TIMEX>, but
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brancacci Chapel</ENAMEX> with the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Masaccio</ENAMEX> frescoes miraculously
        survived intact. The bright light of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</TIMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>, the talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> died at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only five years</TIMEX> of
        promising creative activity (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1423‚Äì1428</ENAMEX>), working with his mild-mannered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">teacher Masolino</ENAMEX> on scenes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genesis</ENAMEX> and the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX>.
        Compare Masolino‚Äôs sweet and harmonious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX> in his Original
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sin</ENAMEX> (chapel entrance, upper right) with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masaccio‚</ENAMEX>Äôs agonizing figures in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Expulsion</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garden of Eden</ENAMEX>, opposite, to appreciate one of
        the early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Renaissance‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most dramatic statements. Nothing like them had
        ever been painted before. Florence‚Äôs greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> at
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>, came to gaze and marvel, sketching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Masaccio‚</ENAMEX>Äôs trail-blazing
        use of light and visual depth as instruments of emotional impact,
        particularly striking in the broad sweep of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter Paying the</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribute Money</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chapel frescoes</ENAMEX> were completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1480s</TIMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Filippino Lippi</ENAMEX>, who painted the side walls‚Äô lower panels.
        For a last panoramic sunset view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> dominated by
        the terracotta cupola of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo</ENAMEX>, take a bus or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> to the vast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazzale Michelangelo</ENAMEX> (anchored by a second copy of his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">David</ENAMEX>). While
        there, visit the charming <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Miniato</ENAMEX> (up the hill
        behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>); rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        oldest and one of its most beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>. Try to be there in late
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> when a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> monks chant timeless Gregorian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vespers</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuscany</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toscana</ENAMEX>)
        The original <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> of the ancient civilization of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruscans</ENAMEX> has always been independent-minded, even aloof, in its
        attitude to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> and the other regions. For the serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Italophile</ENAMEX>, its
        beauty and riches deserve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, even years of attention, but
        no <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> visit would be complete without at least a brief foray here.
        After an easy side-trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiesole</ENAMEX>, our itineraries go
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">farther afield‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwest</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pisa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucca</ENAMEX> before turning south through

        Fiesole
        Just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florence</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> on

        with its austere cathedral founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1028</TIMEX>, is the starting-point for
        some exhilarating hill walks (the tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">piazza</ENAMEX> has

        Only some wall fragments remain of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etruscan</ENAMEX>
        stronghold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiesole</ENAMEX> itself, but there are extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> ruins,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miracoli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Field of Miracles</ENAMEX>), of which its leaning bell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> is a
        national icon, left unscathed by the invasions and wars of succeeding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries</ENAMEX>. Most rushed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> see the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, stand in awe of the

        Conquering a flat landscape with serene, other-worldly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">harmony</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in an emerald green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> also
        known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza del Duomo</ENAMEX> celebrates the whole cycle of life, from

        Thanks to its unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subsoil</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Leaning Tower</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campanile</ENAMEX>) is out of alignment by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 4.5 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ft) though

        It has been closed indefinitely to the public since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> but is
        beautiful to view from afar none the less. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> are forever
        seeking new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> for propping it up, but at its present rate of

        Chianti
        The best introduction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuscan</ENAMEX> hill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is a tour

        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> across to route <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S222</TIMEX>, you find the characteristic landscape

        will explain why.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Grande</ENAMEX>, the highest point in town, is the site
        of the graceful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> well decorated with griffins and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lions</ENAMEX>. The

        If you‚Äôre taking the coast road to or from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> during
        warm-weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, stop off at the fashionable seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> on
        this pine-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">forested</ENAMEX> peninsula beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orbetello</ENAMEX>. The sandy
        beaches and yachting harbors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port‚ÄôErcole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porto Santo Stefano</ENAMEX> are
        favorite weekend destinations for well-heeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romans</ENAMEX> (with a growing
        international presence), but they‚Äôre much quieter during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX>. Take
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> excursion out to the pretty island of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Giglio</ENAMEX>; it is one of the
        islands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tuscan</ENAMEX> archipelago that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elba</ENAMEX>, best known as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">island of Napoleon‚</ENAMEX>Äôs retreat.
        Umbria
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> has a less glamorous reputation than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuscany</ENAMEX>
        (and is reasonably less crowded), but it‚Äôs highly appreciated both for
        its great artistic treasures and the dreamy rolling green landscapes
        that inspired them.
        The area was dominated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> by the papacy, which
        conquered the Lombard dukes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spoleto</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perugia</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, and held sway until the unification of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>. Apart
        from pilgrims streaming to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis‚Äôs Assisi</ENAMEX> and university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
        heading for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perugia</ENAMEX>, it has remained‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇat least in the eyes of foreign
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visitors‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇa very happy backwater.
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26 September 1997</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major earthquakes rocked the
        Umbria region, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> dead and causing extensive damages to
        local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were left homeless, and countless
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX> and public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were forced to close as aftershocks
        continued through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days of October</TIMEX>. Although the international
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> focused on the damage caused in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Assisi</ENAMEX>, much of the region
        suffered structural damage, and many frescoes and monuments important
        throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> were severely damaged or destroyed. Tell-tale
        signs of scaffolding are still visible, although the most visited
        destinations got the most immediate attention in an attempt to ready
        them for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jubilee Year‚</ENAMEX>Äôs tourism.
        Orvieto
        Half the pleasure of this lovely town dramatically perched
        on a rocky precipice is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glimpse of it from afar (not so very

        For a good view, approach it from the southwest, on route S71 from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        Bolsena, or look across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">medieval abbey La Badia</ENAMEX> (now a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>),
        immediately south of town.
        Gourmands come for its noted white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art-lovers</ENAMEX> for
        the magnificent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gothic cathedral</ENAMEX>. Scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> worked on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th centuries</TIMEX> (its central bronze doors
        were added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX>), but its glory remains the gleaming fa√ßade (its
        mosaics were a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> addition), with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> slender spired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pilasters</ENAMEX> and its rose-window above the beautifully scrolled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX>.
        At the base of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> northern pilasters, look closely at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX>
        Maitani‚Äôs marvelous carved marble bas-reliefs of scenes from the Old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Testament and the Last Judgment</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey</ENAMEX> and white bands of marble give the interior a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brizio Chapel</ENAMEX> (a.k.a. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cappella Nuova</ENAMEX>) is famous for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1447</TIMEX> frescoes

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antichrist</ENAMEX> (identified here with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savonarola</ENAMEX>). The nude figures in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resurrection of the Dead</ENAMEX> on the right wall are considered by some art
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> as less convincing. Many echo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci‚</ENAMEX>Äôs comparison
        to ‚Äúsacks of nuts. ‚Äù
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral Museum</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Soliano</ENAMEX> includes other

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Pisano</ENAMEX>.
        If you want to cool off, explore the monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pozzo di</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Patrizio</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> dug <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">63 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">206 ft</ENAMEX>) down into the

        windows, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spiral staircases</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">248</NUMEX> steps take you right down to the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">storerooms</ENAMEX> carved into the soft tufa, begun by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etruscans</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elaborated</ENAMEX> upon by the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romans</ENAMEX>. Guided tours explain the
        earliest chapters of this ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with a visit to its subterranean
        depths.
        Spoleto
        Its greatest tourist attractions are the summer music and
        arts festivals (in particular the world-famous <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spoleto Festival</ENAMEX>
        established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1957</TIMEX>), but the town‚Äôs beautiful natural setting amid
        densely wooded hills also makes it a base for hikes into the
        countryside. Especially popular is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> forest (and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>) on
        Monteluco, favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Bernardino of Siena</ENAMEX>.
        An important <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outpost</ENAMEX> with an excavated amphitheater
        as proof, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spoleto</ENAMEX> also boasts a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sober Romanesque cathedral</ENAMEX> with
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> additions, decorated with damaged but still graceful Fra
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Filippo Lippi</ENAMEX> frescoes (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1469</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> for the licentious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter-monk</ENAMEX>
        who seduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucrezia</ENAMEX> (the model for many of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madonnas</ENAMEX>) was

        Assisi
        The enduring popular appeal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1182‚Äì1226</ENAMEX>) has
        turned his native pink-hued <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs major pilgrimage
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">destination</ENAMEX>, second only to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>. Its basilica, like the peaceful
        medieval town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, has been beautifully preserved, and the
        centuries-old pilgrim trade manages (sometimes just barely) to avoid
        the unashamed commercialism that blights other religious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shrines</ENAMEX>.
        The basilica of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Francesco</ENAMEX> is in fact <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, one
        above the other, built on top of the saint‚Äôs simple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> in the crypt.
        Unfortunately, the basilica was the region‚Äôs one structure that
        suffered the most damage during the earthquakes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, whose
        epicenter was located just outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assisi</ENAMEX>. Several priceless
        frescoes were severely damaged or destroyed, notably invaluable works
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cimabue</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1226‚Äì1337</ENAMEX>) featured on a portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Church‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        vaulted ceiling, which plunged to the floor during the quakes.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Basilica</ENAMEX> was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1228</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> after
        Francis‚Äô death and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of his canonization, and the frescoes were
        painted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> porch now precedes the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> side entrance. The subdued and mystical light of the low vaulted
        nave evokes the sober piety of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> tradition. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tuscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simone Martini</ENAMEX> has decorated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Martin Chapel</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> left) with
        exquisite frescoes, including a most aristocratic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> appearing in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Martin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs dream. Stairs in the nave lead down to the crypt and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis‚Äôs</ENAMEX> tomb, rediscovered only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1818</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> after it had been
        concealed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perugian</ENAMEX> plunderers. The simplicity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> would
        have been much more preferred by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">il Poverello</ENAMEX> than the well-intentioned
        lavishness showered upon the basilica.
        The superb frescoes of the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Mary</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Magdalen Chapel</ENAMEX> (closest to altar on the right nave) and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>

        In the right transept, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cimabue‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous portrait of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Francis</ENAMEX>, believed to be a close physical resemblance, shows him to

        round-the-clock restoration, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cimabue‚Äôs</ENAMEX> works in the apse and left
        transept have turned black, looking like photo negatives because of the

        In the brilliantly illuminated nave, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> are
        exalted by one of the most grandiose series of frescoes in Christendom

        than its mystical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umbrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assisi</ENAMEX>. But the imposing weight of
        its past is lightened by the lively cosmopolitan studentry of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>

        into its medieval ramparts.
        In its picture-perfect town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, something of its old
        aggressive civic power is evoked in the formidable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo dei Priori</ENAMEX>
        (town hall) looming over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 Novembre</ENAMEX> at the far side of its

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. Together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo dei Priori</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX> sustained some damage from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Umbria‚Äôs 1997 earthquake</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the town hall (entrance on Corso

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annunciation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angels</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Umbria‚Äôs</ENAMEX> pride and joy is the

        out for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adoration of the Magi</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna della Consolazione</ENAMEX> as
        sweet and serene as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Umbrian</ENAMEX> landscape of which you‚Äôll catch a
        glimpse through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> windows. Pinturicchio, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> of narrative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fresco</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perugino</ENAMEX>, is represented by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Miracles</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saints</ENAMEX>.
        Next door on the busy pedestrian <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of Corso Vannucci
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collegio del Cambio</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> and chapel of the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Baroque walnut panelling</ENAMEX>. But it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Audience Hall</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dell‚ÄôUdienza</ENAMEX>) that is its highlight, covered with a delightful series

        The presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perugina</ENAMEX> chocolate industry (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">creator</ENAMEX>
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perugino</ENAMEX> bacio in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1922</TIMEX>) is surprisingly low profile. There is no
        flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> or outlet per say, though some of the larger caf√©s in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">town</ENAMEX> carry a representation of the confections produced by the local
        factory which, although open to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, would be of interest only
        to serious chocolate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffs</ENAMEX>.
        Gubbio
        Some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 miles</NUMEX>) north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perugia</ENAMEX>, this no-nonsense
        stalwart hill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is not easy to get to, and once you‚Äôre there it
        remains hard to navigate‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇif you don‚Äôt like climbing steep cobbled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. But for anyone who cherishes the tranquility of a
        quasi-unspoiled medieval atmosphere, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gubbio</ENAMEX> is a delight. The
        brick-paved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza della Signoria</ENAMEX> is the center stage of ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stone</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù Its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> crenellated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo dei Consoli</ENAMEX> is one of the
        grandest civic edifices in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, and from the piazza and the

        surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Then climb (even higher! ) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Palazzo Ducale</ENAMEX>. In
        warm-weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> an open funivia brings you up to the basilica of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant‚ÄôUbaldo</ENAMEX>, the town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>, and you can go from there by foot
        to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">La Rocca</ENAMEX> for unmatched views of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">wild Appennine Mountains</ENAMEX>.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NORTHEAST</ENAMEX>
        Throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs history, its northeast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> have
        linked the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to the exotic outside world of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byzantium</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orient</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Repubblica</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serena</ENAMEX>, and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolomites</ENAMEX>, while the plains of Emilia-Romagna
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravenna</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parma</ENAMEX> provided an anchor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">heartland</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Po</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valley</ENAMEX>.
        The result is a rich variety of distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and
        colorful hinterland. The afterglow of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venice‚</ENAMEX>Äôs once-powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undimmed</ENAMEX>. Made possible by its conquests, elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palladian</ENAMEX> villas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grace the Veneto</ENAMEX> mainland from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padua</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vicenza</ENAMEX>. The glories
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Verona</ENAMEX> extend from its grand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> arena to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medieval</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> whose intrigues and love stories
        inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emilia-Romagna</ENAMEX>, the pride and creativity of
        the great city-states is still very much in evidence in the monuments
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bologna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ferrara</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parma</ENAMEX>. Stretch your muscles in the
        Dolomites, with its first-class <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> sports and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> hiking, or
        soak up sun and sea in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Adriatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rimini</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venezia</ENAMEX>)
        These palazzos, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX>, and lagoons claim a place apart in
        our collective imagination. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this new millennium</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> remains a
        dreamworld more than ever, its myth more powerful than its harsh
        reality. Even when it threatens to disintegrate into nightmare at times
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> floods, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> shenanigans, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer hordes</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> can
        take refuge in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">caf√©</ENAMEX> once frequented by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casanova</ENAMEX> or in a quiet back
        alleyway away from the congestion, and continue their dream
        uninterrupted. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the city‚Äôs many blessings is that there remain so
        many quiet and beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX> that have changed little with time.
        Another obvious bonus, although impossible to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-emphasize, is the
        absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, the simple joy of wandering around a town relieved of
        traffic and pollution, of standing on a little humpback pedestrian
        bridge far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX> and hearing only the water lapping
        against the moss-covered walls, or the occasional swish of a sleek
        gondola that appears out of nowhere. Staying forever is most likely to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> your mind.
        Go in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, if you can‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe crowds at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>
        and from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> can be horrible (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> are hardly
        better, but are at least a bit cooler). <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> has become
        fashionable and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late-winter Carnival</TIMEX> (generally falling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
        or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>), very commercial. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX> it is dank and cold
        but with a mystical beauty all its own. But whenever you go, don‚Äôt try
        to do it all in a day. Without the time to meander and explore those
        hidden corners, you risk not seeing much more than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>,
        and understanding very little of the city‚Äôs inherent charm. Give
        yourself a bare minimum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>, time to get lost (you‚Äôre never
        very far from the main landmarks signposted with bright yellow arrows).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has more than enough sights to see, but you can taste much of
        its pleasures before you even set foot inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>,
        and monuments. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚Äúmust‚</ENAMEX>Äù is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> itself.

        This is where th e <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thousand-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Repubblica Serena</ENAMEX>
        fell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1797</TIMEX>, at the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX>. While he was busy removing the

        The north and south arms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Procuratie Vecchie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Procuratie Nuove</ENAMEX>, were the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> of the

        During the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupation</ENAMEX>, the enemy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">frequented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quadri</ENAMEX> on the

        To catch the piazza and the basilica bathed in moonlight and
        quasi-deserted is a magical thing.
        The glittering fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basilica di San Marco</ENAMEX> forms
        an exotic backdrop, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illuminating Venice‚</ENAMEX>Äôs unique role at the crossroads
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and Western culture. What began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 830</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doges‚</ENAMEX>Äô
        chapel for the remains of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evangelist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX>, the republic‚Äôs patron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saint</ENAMEX>, was rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX> as a grandiose
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oriental</ENAMEX> basilica influenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hagia Sofia</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosaicists</ENAMEX> were brought in to decorate the arches
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX> portals correspond to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX>-style
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domes</ENAMEX> covering the church‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>-cross ground plan. With its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        mosquelike <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX>, it is the most sumptuously exotic and orientally
        inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> ever built in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX> world.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> portal on the left is the only one decorated
        with an original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mosaic</ENAMEX>, depicting the Transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St.</ENAMEX>
        Mark‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Body</ENAMEX>, smuggled out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosaic</ENAMEX> also shows
        the basilica with the famous bronze horses brought from Constantinople
        after the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crusade</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1204</TIMEX> (the ones over the triple-arched main
        entrance are copies, the originals are kept in the basilica <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX>
        since their recent restoration).
        There is a soft glow in the gilded interior from the
        mosaics, gently illuminated by high stained-glass windows, more
        evocative yet with the worn patina of the elaborate inlaid-marble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flooring</ENAMEX>. Entire books have been written about the original mosaics on
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> and the great barrel vaults separating them, dating from
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">11th</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th centuries</TIMEX>. Among the best are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX>
        Pentecost <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> in the nave and the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dome‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascension</ENAMEX>. Others have been heavily restored or replaced, not with true
        mosaics, but with reproductions in colored stone of drawings by such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellini, Mantegna</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tintoretto</ENAMEX>. The whole is worthy of
        its nickname, ‚Äúchurch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù
        The imposing high altar stands over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Mark‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX>.
        Behind it is the basilica‚Äôs greatest treasure, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pala</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôOro (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altarpiece</ENAMEX>), dating back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1,000 years</TIMEX> and bejeweled in its present form
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guides</ENAMEX> will tell you that its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">255</NUMEX> enameled panels
        were encrusted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venetian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> artisans with close to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, including pearls, garnets, sapphires, emeralds
        and rubies. It requires an entrance fee, as does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tesoro</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>),
        a collection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusaders‚</ENAMEX>Äô plunder. To the left of the high altar
        is a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX> whose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna di Nicopeia</ENAMEX>, a bejeweled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">icon</ENAMEX> also from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Constantinople</ENAMEX>, is said to have healing powers and is a
        runner-up as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venice‚</ENAMEX>Äôs protective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Mark</ENAMEX>.
        Steep stairs to the right of the main entrance lead to the
        small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Museo Marciano</ENAMEX>, where you can see the original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tethered
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bronze horses</ENAMEX>, dating from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 2nd</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3rd century</TIMEX> a.d. and a privileged
        close-up of the basilica‚Äôs mosaic ceilings from the museum‚Äôs open
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">galleries</ENAMEX>. From the outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loggia dei Cavalli</ENAMEX>, you get an excellent
        view over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX> and its principal monuments.
        To the right of the loggia (north of the basilica), is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">restored Torre dell‚ÄôOrologio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clock Tower</ENAMEX>), reopened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> in time
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its 500th anniversary</TIMEX>. The clock mechanism, all gilt and polychrome
        enamel, still keeps perfect time, activating statues of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> green
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bronze Moors</ENAMEX> that hammer out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>, the clock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>
        has been every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> favorite rendezvous point, an arched
        ground-level entranceway leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merceria</ENAMEX>, a narrow zig-zagging
        boutique-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that cuts through this ancient <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> on its way
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rialto Bridge</ENAMEX>.
        The piazza‚Äôs beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Campanile</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Tower</ENAMEX>), at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">99 m</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">324</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>) is the highest structure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 centuries</TIMEX> its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">belfry</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lighthouse</ENAMEX>, weather vane, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun turret</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Frederick III</ENAMEX> rode
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> up its spiral ramp (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> can opt for the elevator).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Criminals</ENAMEX> were suspended from it in wooden cages. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1902</TIMEX>, it cracked,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">crumbled</ENAMEX> and collapsed unexpectedly. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ten years later</TIMEX>, on its 1,000th
        anniversary, it was rebuilt using much of the original brick and
        rescuing one of its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> historic bells that is still used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúcom‚Äôera</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dov‚Äôera‚Äù (‚</ENAMEX>Äúas it was, where it was‚Äù). Its collapse

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Loggetta</ENAMEX>, equally lovingly restored as the entrance to the

        brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th century</TIMEX>. They are topped by

        On the waterfront sits the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Doges‚Äô Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Ducale</ENAMEX>),
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">900 years</TIMEX> the focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venice‚</ENAMEX>Äôs uncontested power and pomp, evoked
        in the imposing elegance of its delicate pink marble and white

        Where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">palazzo</ENAMEX> joins the basilica‚Äôs southernmost flank
        is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Porta della Carta</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gate of the Paper</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">doge</ENAMEX> posted his

        Here, as in most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">city‚Äôs palaces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, the walls are
        decorated with painted panels and canvases by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX> rather
        than delicate frescoes, too easily damaged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> climate.

        Highlight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> tour, back down on the second

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marino Faliero</ENAMEX>, beheaded for treason in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1355</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tintoretto‚Äôs Paradise</ENAMEX>
        adorns the entrance wall above the doge‚Äôs throne. Said to be the
        world‚Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> painting, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22 by 7 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">72 by 23 ft</NUMEX>), it was done,
        with the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domenico</ENAMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>. Look for the
        brilliant colors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veronese‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oval ceiling painting of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice Crowned</ENAMEX>
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victory</ENAMEX>, forerunner of the Baroque tours de force in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>.
        For those hoping to go from the sublime to the sinister,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace prisons</ENAMEX>, neat and tidy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> along their narrow corridor,
        become all too romantic with their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque Bridge</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sighs</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponte dei Sospiri</ENAMEX>). The celebrated passage to doom, linking the Ducal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palace</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX>, supposedly moved its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> to sigh on their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to the torture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> (now off-limits). Some of the original
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">graffiti</ENAMEX> can still be seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX>, one of which held Casanova
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 months</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1755</TIMEX> before he escaped.
        The waterfront <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riva degli Schiavoni</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quay of the Slavs</ENAMEX>)
        begins at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ducal Palace</ENAMEX>, named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> who
        unloaded their goods here. The ghosts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagner</ENAMEX>, and Proust
        wander around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> of the venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danieli Hotel</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doge‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        residence that is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most romantic (the romantic lobby bar
        offers a moment of rest for the weary).
        Probably nowhere is there so much spectacular painting on
        view in such a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scuola di San Giorgio</ENAMEX> degli
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schiavoni</ENAMEX>. This captivating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was the confraternity guildhall of
        the wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schiavoni merchants</ENAMEX> who commissioned Vittore Carpaccio
        (whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> belonged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>) to decorate their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX>. His
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> pictures, completed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1502 and 1508</TIMEX>, cover the walls of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ground-floor chapel</ENAMEX>. Note the wonderfully ornate wooden ceiling. It is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of a number of scuole (literally, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚Äúschools‚Äù</ENAMEX> or confraternities)
        unique to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian Republic</ENAMEX>.
        Just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four minutes</TIMEX> by vaporetto from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazzetta</ENAMEX>, on its
        own little island, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Giorgio Maggiore</ENAMEX>; its campanile
        offers the most photogenic view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and its lagoon. The
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is a rare ecclesiastical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea</ENAMEX>
        Palladio, the master <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> from nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vicenza</ENAMEX> whose
        classic designs have so dominated aristocratic residential architecture
        throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. His customary Corinthian-columned
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elegance</ENAMEX> prevails here, extended from the fa√ßade to an airy interior.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> superb paintings by an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tintoretto</ENAMEX> flank the main altar,
        Gathering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manna</ENAMEX> and an otherworldly <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Supper</ENAMEX>, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>
        administers communion while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> bustle to clear up the dishes. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident monks</ENAMEX> still offer mass sung in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gregorian</ENAMEX> chant every

        Around the Accademia
        With an inherent pride so justifiably timeless, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rambling Galleria dell‚ÄôAccademia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accademia Gallery</ENAMEX>) is devoted almost
        exclusively to the artistic legacy of the master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veneto</ENAMEX>, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th century</TIMEX> of the republic‚Äôs emerging glory to

        changed over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. Here are only some of its most
        representative highlights:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Room 1</ENAMEX>: The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coronation</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Room 4</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Mantegna</ENAMEX> (a brother-in-law of the Bellini

        To the east of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accademia</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>, a

        Where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX> empties into the lagoon stands the

        the city‚Äôs deliverance from a plague in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1630</TIMEX>. For a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX> edifice
        (and one of the finest outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>), the interior is rather sober,
        even chaste. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tintoretto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs best, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Marriage</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cana</ENAMEX>, is on the

        To the west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accademia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ca‚Äô Rezzonico</ENAMEX> is another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canal</ENAMEX>-side design of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longhena</ENAMEX>, completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> and now a

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browning</ENAMEX> bought the palazzo, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> died in a first-floor

        frivolous lives of the idle rich.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> was home to a number of scuole that were not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúschools‚Äù</ENAMEX> at all but old confraternities similar, minus their religious

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX> portrayed as a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youth</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiepolo</ENAMEX> and Titian
        are interlopers here, the latter with a solitary albeit remarkable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">easel</ENAMEX> painting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annunciation</ENAMEX>. Tintoretto‚Äôs masterpiece in
        chiaroscuro effects is the grandiose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crucifixion</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala</ENAMEX>

        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frari</ENAMEX> (full name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari</ENAMEX>, built by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Franciscans</ENAMEX>), above all celebrated for the high altar adorned with
        Titian‚Äôs jubilant Assumption of the Virgin. The master‚Äôs only painting
        on such a massive scale is a triumph of primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reds</ENAMEX>, blues, and
        yellows that irresistibly draw you up to the altar. Drag yourself away
        to see his other work here, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna di Ca‚Äô Pesaro</ENAMEX> (left nave), in
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">St. Peter</ENAMEX> presents the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pesaro</ENAMEX>, a wealthy local

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Maria dei Miracoli</ENAMEX>. Its refined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fa√</ENAMEX>ßade of delicate inlaid colored

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> worth carefully mapping out your visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campo</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santi Giovanni</ENAMEX> e <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paolo</ENAMEX>. Follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calle Larga Giacinto Gallina</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">humpbacked Ponte del Cavallo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> for the all-important first view of
        the piazza‚Äôs magnificent equestrian statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartolomeo Colleoni</ENAMEX>,
        considered one of the finest in the world. With his last and greatest
        piece of sculpture brilliantly evoking all the fierce resolution of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">condottiere</ENAMEX> riding into battle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Verrocchio</ENAMEX> need not regret
        abandoning painting to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci</ENAMEX>. Colleoni willed his
        huge fortune to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> on the understanding that his monument would be
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Marco</ENAMEX>. Once dead, he had to settle for this spot in front
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scuola of San Marco</ENAMEX>, a clever <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX> solution. The piazza‚Äôs
        main attraction is the massive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of Santi
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giovanni</ENAMEX> e <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paolo</ENAMEX>, a name compressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetians</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Zanipolo</ENAMEX>.
        Built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dominicans</ENAMEX>, it was the doges‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">funeral church</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 25</NUMEX>
        buried here, many in masterpieces of monumental tombs.
        Returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Grand Canal</ENAMEX>: You‚Äôll find in the glorious
        Ca‚Äô d‚ÄôOro the quintessential decorative tradition of Venetian
        architecture, arguably more successful in its compact form here than in
        the beautiful but sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Doges‚Äô Palace</ENAMEX>. Completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1440</TIMEX>, its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flamboyant Gothic</ENAMEX> design has a flair and grace that bewitch you into
        imagining the long-gone gilt of its fa√ßade (from which it earned its
        name). Take another, more leisurely, boat-ride for the view from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">canal</ENAMEX>. The treasures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ca‚Äôd‚ÄôOro‚Äôs Galleria Franchetti</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> art include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Mantegna‚Äôs St. Sebastian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titian‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venus</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mirror</ENAMEX>.
        Off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beaten Track</ENAMEX>
        Among the corners of town far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX>, the old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish Ghetto</ENAMEX> (northeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway station</ENAMEX>) is particularly
        peaceful and reveals a fascinating page of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX> history. It was the
        former site of an abandoned iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foundry</ENAMEX>, ghetto in old Venetian
        dialect, which lent its name to this and scores of other future
        enclaves for the forced isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> (or other minority)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1516</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 900</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> (rising to a peak
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 5,000</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-17th century</TIMEX>) were confined to what was then
        a remote and isolated island.
        They built the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-story tenements you see
        today, cramped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> twice as high as those permitted
        elsewhere, with some floors <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 6</NUMEX> ft high. The only way to
        visit any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> still active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">synagogues</ENAMEX> is with a
        guided tour offered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Ebraico</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campo del Ghetto Nuovo</ENAMEX>.
        A handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> still live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghetto</ENAMEX>.
        On the island of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giudecca</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find another of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great Palladio</ENAMEX>-designed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> (one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redentore</ENAMEX>.
        The grace of its overall form is best viewed from across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>,
        because, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚</ENAMEX>Äôs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> disappears at closer
        quarters behind its elongated nave. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giudecca</ENAMEX> takes it name either
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> (giudei) who lived here prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghetto‚</ENAMEX>Äôs founding or
        from the giudicati, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nobles</ENAMEX> banished here by ducal judgment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> now a
        quiet residential refuge popular with artists‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> seeking to
        escape the mobs.
        Out in the lagoon, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetians</ENAMEX> have been manufacturing glass
        on the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murano</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1292</TIMEX>, when the hazardous furnaces were
        moved away from the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Today, its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are an
        undeniable tourist trap, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Vetrario</ENAMEX>) tracing the
        glass industry back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times is worth a look. Many enjoy watching
        burly fellows blowing molten globules into cute little green giraffes.
        The island‚Äôs quiet spot is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Venetian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> church
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Maria e San Donato</ENAMEX>, with a powerful mosaic in the apse.
        The island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burano</ENAMEX> is a simple fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>, true
        haven of tranquility, though the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">olden days</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> making lace on
        the doorsteps of their brightly colored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> on the quay and
        no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hustlers</ENAMEX> is all but history. A local attempt to keep alive its
        centuries-old lace-making legacy continues, though much of what‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hawked</ENAMEX> is machine-made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>.
        Hemingway‚Äôs favorite old hangout, the romantically
        overgrown island of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torcello</ENAMEX>, beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burano</ENAMEX>, is one of the lagoon‚Äôs
        oldest inhabited spots, very prosperous until emptied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>
        epidemic. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> have gone, but its superb cathedral remains.
        Founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seventh century</TIMEX> and reconstructed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1008</TIMEX>, it‚Äôs probably
        the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venetian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest
        outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ravenna</ENAMEX>. In the apse there‚Äôs a moving mosaic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>
        above a frieze of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apostles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice the</ENAMEX> fine Corinthian capitals
        on the slender <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> marble columns.
        With its sandy beaches and smart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lido</ENAMEX> is as
        restful as any fashionable seaside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> come as something of a shock, though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> alike still prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>. Nostalgics take <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H√¥tel des Bains</ENAMEX> to recall the decadent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1900s</TIMEX>, evoked there by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas</ENAMEX>

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brenta Canal</ENAMEX>
        When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venetian</ENAMEX> aristocrats gave up the high seas for a more
        leisurely life on the land, they built <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palladian Renaissance</ENAMEX> villas and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brenta Canal</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padua</ENAMEX>. For those with time, a romantic

        (route S <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Padua</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Padova</ENAMEX>). First stop, off a side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fusina</ENAMEX>,
        is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Palladio‚Äôs La Malcontenta</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1571</TIMEX>), to which a too-flighty Venetian
        countess was sent to pine, malcontentedly, in exquisite isolation on

        modest opinion was that it ‚Äúranked among the most noble and most

        Across the piazza in a little garden, the audacious Teatro

        as a belvedere for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardinal Capra</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1567</TIMEX>, it‚Äôs an exquisite piece of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shakespeare‚Äôs ‚ÄúFair Verona‚Äù of Romeo and Juliet</ENAMEX> fame,

        Degna, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dignified</ENAMEX>, but it also has a very lively and well-to-do
        atmosphere, stimulated by the presence of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adige</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">river</ENAMEX> that flows
        swiftly down from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dolomites</ENAMEX>. The memory of its fierce medieval
        history lingers still, the tales of family feuds that inspired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Shakespeare‚Äôs Romeo and Juliet</ENAMEX> ended only with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 14th-century</TIMEX>
        ascendancy of the tough Scalageri dynasty, in turn conquered by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1405</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of city life is the vast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piazza Br√†</ENAMEX>, with the town

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>. Only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of its outer arches survived an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1183</TIMEX> earthquake
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">undamaged</ENAMEX>, but the inner arcade of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX> arches is intact. The elliptical

        Turn right at the end down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Cappello</ENAMEX> for the

        believe was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juliet‚Äôs House</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa di Giulietta Cappelletti</ENAMEX>), complete
        with balcony. The graffiti that covers the entranceway and ancient

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forum</ENAMEX> makes the prettiest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">marketplaces</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval houses</ENAMEX> and old

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alto Adige</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Austrian South Tyrol</ENAMEX> till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1918</TIMEX>) is a delight. Well-marked

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inland</ENAMEX>, on the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">railway</ENAMEX>, is the old city

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flaminia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Emilia</ENAMEX> (which gave the region its name). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ponte di</ENAMEX>

        Ravenna
        For those who find it difficult to appreciate mosaics as

        said to be the finest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
        Now some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX>) from the sea, the ancient capital

        The oldest most striking of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> monuments, in

        but no one knows if her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">remains</ENAMEX> (she died in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450</NUMEX>) are in one of them
        (her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> should fill the others). The deep blue, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, and

        the arts, of modern design of clothes and furniture, and of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">automobile</ENAMEX> and communications industries.
        For relaxation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera</ENAMEX> east and west of Genoa
        alternates a rugged coastli ne with the occasional fine sandy beach.
        Hugging the slopes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Bianco</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Courmayeur</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        oldest, and one of its most stylish, ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> and east of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> are the romantic lakes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Como, Maggiore</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garda</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>
        Quite happy to leave the embroiled politics of national
        government to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> prides itself on being the country‚Äôs
        economic, cultural, and design-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>. Despite its
        prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and shopping, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magnificent Gothic cathedral</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> do not think of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> as an
        obvious holiday destination (though some do make the pilgrimage just
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Last Supper</ENAMEX>). But anyone interested in
        contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> life will want to experience its caf√©s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX>,
        elegant shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX>, and side-street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>. If the main
        railway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is an overwhelming homage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX> and fascist
        design (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1925‚Äì1931</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pirelli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">skyscraper</ENAMEX>, opposite, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>),
        is a more graceful symbol of the new era. With its vivacious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">¬≠fashionable</ENAMEX>, self-assured and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sophisticated‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthis</ENAMEX> is modern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>.
        Around the Duomo
        Nowhere does a cathedral more distinctly dominate a major
        city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Almost non-stop throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, but especially at that
        magic moment of the passeggiata, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza del Duomo</ENAMEX> is one of the
        liveliest squares in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> gather around the caf√©s,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">kiosks</ENAMEX>, and shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX>, the young on their cell phones confirming
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evening</ENAMEX> plans, the pensionati talking <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> (soccer) and
        politics.
        And all in the shadow of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo</ENAMEX>, most grandiose of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Italy‚Äôs Flamboyant Gothic</ENAMEX> cathedrals. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teams</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flemish</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architects</ENAMEX> and sculptors contributed to this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">astonishing cathedral</ENAMEX>, begun in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1386</TIMEX> by the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visconti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. For
        the best view of that awesomely rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fa√</ENAMEX>ßade, finished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1813</TIMEX>, and
        bristling silhouette of marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pinnacles</ENAMEX> and statues, stand in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Reale</ENAMEX> south of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. (It houses the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathedral Museum</ENAMEX>, which displays fine examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> sculpture from
        the fa√ßade. ) The cathedral‚Äôs interior is a vast and noble space
        divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> columns, showing its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North European</ENAMEX> influence in the
        soaring columns and a decoration of stained-glass windows, from the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th century</TIMEX> to the present day.
        Give yourself plenty of time for a spectacular walk out on
        the roof. The elevator entrance (clearly signposted outside the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cathedral</ENAMEX>) is in the right transept. Wander high above the city turmoil
        under the flying buttresses and around the statues (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,245</NUMEX> in all) and
        forest of pinnacles (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">135</ENAMEX>), up to the roof-ridge for an unbeatable view
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. To go down, take the staircase (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX> steps) for some
        fascinating close-ups of the cathedral‚Äôs construction.
        Leading north from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza del Duomo</ENAMEX>, the huge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-shaped shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arcade</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galleria Vittorio Emanuele</ENAMEX> is a
        splendid steel and glass monument to the expansive commercial spirit of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, and a prototype of today‚Äôs shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caf√©s</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">restaurants</ENAMEX>, bookshops, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> are showcased in its unabashed
        neo-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> d√©cor. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galleria</ENAMEX> provides a sheltered, much
        trafficked pedestrian passage from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo</ENAMEX> to another holy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>,
        the revered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Scala</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> of opera. Even
        if you can‚Äôt be there for an opera (opening with a gala to end all
        galas every sacrosanct <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 7</TIMEX>), attend a concert or dance
        performance there or at least visit the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> (left of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theater</ENAMEX>), if only for a chance to see a strand of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mozart‚Äôs</ENAMEX> hair,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Toscanini‚Äôs baton</ENAMEX>, or a peak into the sumptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neoclassical</ENAMEX> auditorium
        with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> tiers of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX>.
        Milan‚Äôs most prestigious retail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">thoroughfare</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Monte</ENAMEX>
        Napoleone, an august parade of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neoclassical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palazzi</ENAMEX> and luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. A
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grid</ENAMEX> of narrow side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Borgospesso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Sant‚ÄôAndrea</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via della Spiga</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Bagutta</ENAMEX> take you into a more tranquil
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> world, now graced by the overflow of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montenapoleone‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        high-fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">art galleries</ENAMEX>, antique <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and the town‚Äôs
        smartest trattorie.
        Around Castello Sforzesco
        The massive brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castello Sforzesco</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwest</ENAMEX> of the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, was originally built by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visconti</ENAMEX> and
        later rebuilt in its present form in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francesco</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sforza</ENAMEX>. The bulk of the solid square <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure stands</ENAMEX> around a vast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">courtyard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza</ENAMEX> d‚ÄôArmiles. Beyond, in the handsome old residential
        quarters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corte Ducale</ENAMEX>, is the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Castello</ENAMEX> Sforzesco
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musei Civici</ENAMEX>, a series of small art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>, devoted to sculpture,
        painting (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinacoteca</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, furniture, and archaeology. In
        collections that include important works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Bellini</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mantegna</ENAMEX>,
        Titian, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Correggio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tintoretto</ENAMEX>, pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">place‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">itself‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇgoes</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michelangelo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> last work, the unfinished Rondanini
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piet√†</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1564</TIMEX>). Working on it until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</TIMEX> before his death, the
        sculptor chiselled a pathetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX> struggling to hold up the dead
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>, a strange throwback to medieval sculpture for his last tussle
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recalcitrant stone</ENAMEX>.
        Even without <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci‚</ENAMEX>Äôs masterpiece in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjoining</ENAMEX> refectory, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria delle Grazie</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX>
        Caradosso, southwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castello</ENAMEX>) would be worth a visit as a jewel
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> architecture. Adding to an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> design, Donato
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bramante‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇPope Julius II‚</ENAMEX>Äôs chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Rome‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfashioned</ENAMEX> a
        magnificent red brick and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone chancel</ENAMEX> (tribuna) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>. The
        graceful lines of the rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-sided cupola are best
        viewed from the little cloister that he built on the north side. Inside
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, stand in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX> to appreciate the majesty of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dome</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs Last Supper</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cenacolo</ENAMEX>) has been
        lovingly resuscitated in the little <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dominican</ENAMEX> refectory to the left of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. The completion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> of a laborious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-year</TIMEX> restoration
        helped remove centuries of deterioration and clumsy restoration since
        it was completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1497</TIMEX>. More than ever, it unveiled the enormous
        psychological impact in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leonardo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs depiction of the trauma for each of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> declares: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>ÄúOne of you will betray me. ‚Äù As a
        result of the painstaking <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">centimeter-by-centimeter</NUMEX> recovery of the
        fragmentary but still powerful traces of the ‚Äúreal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo</ENAMEX>,‚Äù we can
        now see, for example, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> to the right) has an
        expression of acute grief rather than the simpering pathos left by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">‚Äúrestorers‚Äù</ENAMEX> who presumed to improve on the original.
        For another aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci‚</ENAMEX>Äôs talents, visit
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo della Scienza e della Tecnica</ENAMEX>) housed in a
        former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benedictine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> on the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Via San Vittore</ENAMEX>. Among the
        rooms devoted to the history of science and technology, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> is
        reserved for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Leonardo‚Äôs</ENAMEX> inventions, displayed as models constructed
        from his notebooks. You‚Äôll see his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, a machine for making
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screws</ENAMEX>, hydraulic timber-cutter, revolving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, various
        machine-tools, and a system of map-¬≠making by aerial views‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇcreated
        long before any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, even his, was operational.
        At the eastern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via San Vittore</ENAMEX>, beyond a noble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atrium courtyard</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant‚Äô Ambrogio</ENAMEX> is the city‚Äôs most
        revered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>, built from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th centuries</TIMEX>. It
        stands on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> that dates back to the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Ambrose</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">340‚Äì397</ENAMEX>), first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bishop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church‚</ENAMEX>Äôs four founding

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crypt</ENAMEX>. Its sober <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five-bayed fa√</NUMEX>ßade set the golden standard for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lombard Romanesque</ENAMEX> style, flanked by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campanile</ENAMEX> and
        taller <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> topped by a modern loggia. In the interior,
        left of the center nave, notice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 11th-century</TIMEX> pulpit standing on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sarcophagus</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era. Under the canopy carved with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> reliefs is the high altar, richly encased in
        elaborate, bejeweled, and enamelled plates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Brera and Other Museums</ENAMEX>
        The handsome <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jesuits</ENAMEX> is now the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinacoteca di Brera</ENAMEX>, one of the country‚Äôs foremost art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">medieval</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> art, concentrating on the master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">northern Italy</ENAMEX>. In its fine arcaded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX>, notice a bronze statue
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX>, who was responsible for turning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brera</ENAMEX> into a national
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX> with confiscations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and recalcitrant nobles.
        Among the highlights: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paintings by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Bellini</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Child</ENAMEX> and a highly personal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piet√†; Veronese‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> in

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">impressive Christ</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Column by Donato Bramante</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mantegna</ENAMEX> has a touching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madonna</ENAMEX>, but his true masterpiece
        here is the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dead Christ</ENAMEX>, achieving a gripping emotional effect with its
        foreshortened perspective. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piero della Francesca‚Äôs</ENAMEX> celebrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montefeltro Altarpiece</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1474</TIMEX>) is his last work. Raphael‚Äôs stately
        Betrothal of the Virgin contrasts with the earthier inspiration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caravaggio‚Äôs Supper</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emmaus</ENAMEX>.
        Note the gentle beauty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Correggio‚Äôs Nativity</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adoration of the Magi</ENAMEX>. The non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Greco</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Dyck</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX>. In the modern collection, look out for
        Modigliani, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boccioni, de Chirico, Carr√†</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Pisis</ENAMEX>. Enjoy the Brera
        neighborhood, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreenwich Village</ENAMEX>,‚Äù after your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> visit; it
        has been regentrified in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> and now offers cutting-edge
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quaintness</ENAMEX> in its trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, stylish caf√©s and reputed art
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">galleries</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biblioteca Ambrosiana</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza Pio XI</ENAMEX>) has reopened in
        the newly restored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cardinal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federigo</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borromeo</ENAMEX>. Its principal treasure, though of contested provenance, is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo da Vinci‚</ENAMEX>Äôs luminous <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Portrait of a Musician</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1485</TIMEX>), unfinished
        but at the same time the best preserved of the master‚Äôs few surviving
        works. You can see his pervasive influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Milanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> in the
        decorative paintings of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bernardino</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luini</ENAMEX> and a fine <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Portrait of a Young</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Woman</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrogio de Predis</ENAMEX>. Caravaggio‚Äôs only still life, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Bowl</ENAMEX> of

        especially interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raphael‚</ENAMEX>Äôs cartoons (preparatory drawings) for
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">School</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> fresco in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poldi-Pezzoli Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Via Manzoni 12</ENAMEX>) is a small,

        from eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early Middle Ages</TIMEX>. But it proved to be the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, and rival <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">duchies</ENAMEX> and city-states such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, which
        pushed its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serene Republic</ENAMEX> as far west as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bergamo</ENAMEX>. Natural fertility

        Pavia
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lombards‚Äô</ENAMEX> first capital, before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>, is now a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sleepy</ENAMEX>, well-preserved, redbrick university <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. Its principal

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX> is a high point in the transition from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flamboyant Gothic</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>. Even without the originally designed crowning gable, the
        sculpted multi-colored marble fa√ßade makes an impact, with statues of
        prophets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, and apostles above the medallion reliefs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emperors</ENAMEX>.
        The massive <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> interior is lightened by the brightly

        Baroque finishings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 16th century</TIMEX>, notice an exquisite

        Rising out of the plain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Po</ENAMEX> valley on its own steep

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza Matteotti</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hub</ENAMEX> of the new town‚Äôs lively caf√© scene, along

        Bellini, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raphael</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Titian</ENAMEX> as well as foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX>.
        Venetian ramparts still protect the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citt√</ENAMEX>† Alta
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Upper City</ENAMEX>) on the hill, the older section of town linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citt√</ENAMEX>†
        Bassa by funicular. The gracious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza Vecchia</ENAMEX> is surrounded by

        that his design was inspired by the contours of the lake. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">km</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 miles</NUMEX>) from the ruggedly romantic cliffs of the neck down to its

        At the south end, boat cruises start out from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peschiera</ENAMEX>,
        Sirmione, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desenzano</ENAMEX>, particularly recommended for dramatic views of

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moated</ENAMEX> and turreted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocca Scaligera</ENAMEX>. The drive itself,

        is much appreciated for its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and botanical gardens and as a base

        Embraced by green wooded escarpments and backed by

        The lake dramatically divides into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> on either side

        The lake‚Äôs southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> is the most attractive for your

        The northern, more blustery end of the lake is in

        peaceful fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> with tiny narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Isola Madre</ENAMEX>,
        farther out in the lake, is the largest and most peaceful of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>. It might pass for deserted, if not for the peacocks and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pheasants</ENAMEX> who inhabit the botanical gardens, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> strolling
        amidst the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">palms</ENAMEX> and rhododendrons.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piedmont</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piemonte</ENAMEX>)
        As its name suggests, this region of the fertile upper
        basin of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Po</ENAMEX> river lies in the foothills between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appenines</ENAMEX> and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alps</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> borders.
        From the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, it
        stood outside the mainstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> history. Its royal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savoy</ENAMEX> walked a diplomatic tightrope between the rivalries of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> emperors until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX>.
        The new nationalism led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piedmont</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> orbit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risorgimento</ENAMEX> unification movement, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Savoy</ENAMEX> served as
        Italy‚Äôs reigning royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1861 to 1946</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turin</ENAMEX> serving
        ever so briefly as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the newly unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1861</TIMEX>.
        Close links to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> have left their mark. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        patois-like dialect is still spoken in some hill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and you‚Äôll
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">notice</ENAMEX> bilingual street signs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aosta Valley</ENAMEX> (geographically part
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piedmont</ENAMEX>, but administratively separate). For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Courmayeur</ENAMEX>,
        the country‚Äôs most venerable ski <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, never adopted its more Italian
        name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cortemaggiore</ENAMEX>. The classical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and squares of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turin</ENAMEX>,
        Piedmont‚Äôs royal capital, are in many ways closer in spirit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
        than the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>. But whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallic</ENAMEX> ambience this may have
        created has been thoroughly ‚ÄúItalianized‚Äù by the steady influx of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> from the south for the steel, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, automobile, and
        communications industries.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torino</ENAMEX>)
        Best known for its industry, most notably the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pirelli</ENAMEX> works, the proud <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piedmontese</ENAMEX> capital is far from being a
        dull or dismal factory <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>. It has retained the grid-like layout of
        its origins as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taurinorum</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> castrum. Its rise to prominence in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th and 18th centuries</TIMEX> was accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚Äôs</ENAMEX> first coherent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> planning; classical and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and monuments give its
        main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and squares a great dignity and panache augmented by the
        city‚Äôs economic prosperity.
        The tone is set by the formal elegance of the Piazza
        Castello, dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filippo Juvarra‚</ENAMEX>Äôs richly articulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>
        fa√ßade for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Madama</ENAMEX>. The original <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval castle</ENAMEX> received
        its new name when transformed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> into the royal
        residence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vittorio Amedeo I‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">widow</ENAMEX>, nicknamed <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">‚ÄúMadama Reale,‚Äù a.k.a</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Cristina</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. It now houses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civic Museum of Ancient Art</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Civico di Arte Antica</ENAMEX>) beside a splendid ceremonial staircase,
        also designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juvarra</ENAMEX>. The paintings include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Van Eyck‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">miniatures</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Book of Hours</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duc de Berry</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontormo‚Äôs St. Michael</ENAMEX>, and a particularly handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Portrait of a Man</ENAMEX>
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sicilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonello da Messina</ENAMEX>. On the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> are the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">royal</ENAMEX> collections of furniture, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ceramics</ENAMEX>, and carved ivories.
        Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> is the former royal chapel, the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX>, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turin‚</ENAMEX>Äôs other great

        as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX>, he has created a marvelously intricate interior
        surrounding the octagonal space with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> red marble columns. Arches rise
        to hold the central lanterned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cupola</ENAMEX> formed by an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-pointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Reale</ENAMEX>) was the ornately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy</ENAMEX> princes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1600s</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1865</TIMEX>. After strolling
        through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sumptuous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> after another, visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> that houses
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armeria Reale</ENAMEX>), for a look at the important collection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and armor dating back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and Etruscan
        times. It is one of the most comprehensive of its kind in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>. Then
        relax a while behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Reale</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Gardens</ENAMEX> (Giardini
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reali</ENAMEX>), designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tuileries and Versailles</ENAMEX>

        The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 15th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duomo di San Giovanni</ENAMEX>)
        cherishes one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most celebrated (and controversial) relics,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shroud</ENAMEX> said to have wrapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> after his descent from the cross,
        taking the imprint of his face and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Sometimes enshrined in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapel</ENAMEX> of the Holy Shroud (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cappella della Santa Sindone</ENAMEX>), it was
        brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th century</TIMEX> after a journey <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years</TIMEX> earlier
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyprus</ENAMEX>. Measuring <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.1 by 1.4 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ft</ENAMEX>), the sheet is kept in an iron-lined silver casket placed in a
        marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">urn</ENAMEX> and tucked away in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo della Sidone</ENAMEX>, and is rarely on
        display to the public (with the recent exception of the Holy Year
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>). During the occasions that it is on display, it is brought to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chapel</ENAMEX>. Many dispute the modern scientific tests that have proven it to
        be a medieval fabrication, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faithful</ENAMEX> and merely curious
        still visit its black marble <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chapel</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">masterpiece of Guarini‚Äôs High</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX>, with its cone-shaped, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-tiered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> formed by a web of
        intersecting arches that rise to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-pointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>. It was recently
        restored after a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> fire that left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, alarmed
        at how close it came to being completely destroyed.
        The pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turin</ENAMEX>, as in so many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, is not
        in one monument but in a glorious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Piazza San Carlo</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Santa Cristina</ENAMEX>, one of the most beautiful in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palazzi</ENAMEX> make an exquisite setting for your late afternoon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">passeggiata</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and caf√©s, culminating in the

        importance only to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoys‚Äô</ENAMEX> collection of more
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> items is on display, including priceless treasures such as
        the staggering variety of statues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaohs</ENAMEX> of the period around

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemmed</ENAMEX> in between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Apennine mountains</ENAMEX> and the sea, for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">centuries Genoa</ENAMEX> tended, like historic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX> on the east coast,
        to turn its back on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> and seek its fortune on the high seas. This
        may account for a cool reserve, almost aloofness, that some read even
        into the architecture of the tall <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the straight and narrow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">streets</ENAMEX> behind the port.
        With <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">28 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 miles</NUMEX>) of docks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs biggest port
        remains the key to the city‚Äôs identity. As an important maritime center
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire, Genoa</ENAMEX> would later be put on the map of sea-faring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">annals</ENAMEX> forever as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quincentennial</ENAMEX> anniversary celebrating his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX> voyage saw the city‚Äôs
        historical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> undergo a face-lift, and the addition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquarium</ENAMEX>,
        the largest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, a must-see for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
        The main shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> of this little-visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is
        Via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XX Settembre</ENAMEX> west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza De Ferrari</ENAMEX> that constitutes the
        city‚Äôs bustling modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, where the city‚Äôs historic quarters
        begin. Piazza <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Matteo</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval home</ENAMEX> of the august Doria
        family, navigators and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">merchants</ENAMEX> who helped build the city‚Äôs great
        commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. Their arcade <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, with gray-and-white striped
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fa√ßades</ENAMEX> (numbers <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15‚Äì17</NUMEX>) were built from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15th century</TIMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Matteo</ENAMEX> has the same gray-and-white
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fa√ßade.</ENAMEX> In the crypt, you‚Äôll find the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tomb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Doria</ENAMEX>, great
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> admiral who took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genoa</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> against the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and became the city‚Äôs virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Garibaldi</ENAMEX>
        are a unique testimony to the town‚Äôs historic prosperity, many of them
        now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palazzo Bianco</ENAMEX> (number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) makes a handsome
        setting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoa‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most important art collection, mostly the work of
        Genoese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambiaso, Strozzi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magnasco</ENAMEX>, as well as works by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontormo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma il Vecchio</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Flemish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">school‚</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ Rubens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G√</ENAMEX>©rard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Dyck</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The 17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque Palaz¬≠zo Rosso</ENAMEX> (number
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>), taking its name from the red fa√ßade, displays works by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veronese</ENAMEX>,
        Titian, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caravaggio, D√ºrer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubens</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Dyck</ENAMEX>.
        Not only did his home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> not finance his crazy trip to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoa</ENAMEX> still has no decent monument to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX>. The closest reference you‚Äôll find is on a ramp leading to the
        Port a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soprana</ENAMEX>, a medieval turreted gate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Dante</ENAMEX>, where there
        is an obscure plaque indicating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of the discoverer‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera Resorts</ENAMEX>
        Along the mostly rugged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera di Levante</ENAMEX> east of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoa</ENAMEX>,
        by far the prettiest spot is tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portofino</ENAMEX>, seemingly more fishing and
        sailing harbor than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX>, but look and you‚Äôll find some fine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>
        and private villas back in the forest-covered hills. From the
        colorfully painted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> clustered around the postage stamp-sized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">harbor</ENAMEX>, avoid the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> of day-trippers by setting out on a paved
        cliff walk. Pass the yellow-painted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Giorgio</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lighthouse</ENAMEX> (faro) at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>-protected Promontory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monte Portofino</ENAMEX> for a superb view along the coast. The cliffs are
        clothed in a profusion of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vegetation</ENAMEX>, with occasional glimpses
        of private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> framed by cypresses, palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and cascades of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bougainvillaea</ENAMEX>. Boat excursions will take you to other beautifully
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">secluded</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, such as the historic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Fruttuoso</ENAMEX>,
        reachable only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-hour</TIMEX> walk, and delightfully unspoiled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camogli</ENAMEX>. By foot, you can also visit the charming little fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">hamlet</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Rocco</ENAMEX> and take a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-minute</TIMEX> walk over to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Punta Chiappa</ENAMEX>, looking
        out over the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> boat ride from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa</ENAMEX> Margherita
        is the cluster of former fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cinque Terre</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cliff</ENAMEX>-clinging hamlets hugging a stretch of coastline reminiscent of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one hundred years ago</TIMEX>. Reachable only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> until
        recently, they are linked by a network of ancient cliffside mule paths
        that provide some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs loveliest treks.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Margherita Ligure</ENAMEX> is a lively resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> full of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caf√©s</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>, and a palm-lined waterfront esplanade
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX>-serving trattorie. It absorbs the tourism neighboring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Positano</ENAMEX> cannot accommodate. The family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sestri Levante</ENAMEX> has
        fine sandy beaches. Most popular of all, down the coast beyond the
        naval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Spezia</ENAMEX>, are the beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viareggio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> Tuscan
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resort</ENAMEX>, together with its more up-market <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forte dei Marmi</ENAMEX>.
        Cool off with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an excursion</NUMEX> inland to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carrara</ENAMEX>, where the
        marble quarries provided the raw material for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">achievements</ENAMEX>, the monuments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is still full of sculptors, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Alberica</ENAMEX> is the scene
        of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> sculpture <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">competition‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ÄÇ14 days</TIMEX> to produce a masterpiece.
        Visit the still active quarries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fantiscritti</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colonnata</ENAMEX>. The
        marble that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelangelo</ENAMEX> chose for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piet√</ENAMEX>† is now hewn, at
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,000</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a cubic meter</NUMEX>, for replicas at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Caesar‚Äôs Palace</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tombstones</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Angeles Forest Lawn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cemetery</ENAMEX>, and countless homes
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheiks</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riviera di Ponente</ENAMEX>, west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genoa</ENAMEX> toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        border, is an almost continuous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. A faded resort
        of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> times, dignified <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">San Remo</ENAMEX> is the best known, with its
        well-heeled casino and elegant promenade along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corso Imperatrice</ENAMEX>.
        For <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> away from the beach, explore the narrow, winding medieval
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop La Pigna</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX>, leading up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sanctuary of Madonna della Costa</ENAMEX>.
        The quieter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bordighera</ENAMEX> is particularly proud of
        the palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lungomare Argentina</ENAMEX> promenade. Since the 16th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has had the exclusive privilege of providing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>
        with its palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fronds</ENAMEX> for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alassio</ENAMEX> completes
        this coast‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> of major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, justifiably proud of its gardens
        nurtured by a particularly mild <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>. Take an excursion east to the
        quiet medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albenga</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Romanesque</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> houses
        around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th- to 14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX> and early <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth-century</TIMEX>) baptistery.
        THE <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SOUTH</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the great joys of the south is the extent to which
        it is still virgin land for the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. It has
        its perennial favorites: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> islands of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Capri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ischia</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>, the ruins of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> of the singularly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beautiful Amalfi</ENAMEX> coast. Otherwise, southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> is overlooked by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> almost as much as it has been by the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> since
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1871</TIMEX> reunification. Less prosperous than the north, it cannot offer
        the same wealth of modern hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monuments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> have
        suffered from earthquakes (the last catastrophic one was in Campania
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>), and civic neglect. But things are slowly improving and the
        compensations for the more venturesome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> are considerable. The
        chief pleasure of the south, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mezzogiorno</ENAMEX>, is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, who are
        warm-hearted, outgoing, and gregarious.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoli</ENAMEX>)
        The very idea of this teeming, undisciplined <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> once
        intimidated the faint-hearted, but the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last decade</TIMEX> has seen interesting
        change in this history-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of which the enterprising and cheerful
        Neapolitans are justifiably proud. For adventurous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> looking
        for an introduction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>, the rewards are rich. Indeed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
        Naples‚Äô <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX> are among the most important in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, but they and
        the piazzas and monuments play <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> fiddle to the colorful street
        life. In the outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> that is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> is unabashed
        melodrama: around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, the popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarters</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaccanapoli</ENAMEX>, even
        the more bourgeois neighborhoods of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vomero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Posillipo</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll want
        to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> is where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> began (the
        region is the nation‚Äôs number one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supplier</ENAMEX> of mozzarella), and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flavorful</ENAMEX> home-cooking of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredients</ENAMEX> has been raised to an art
        form.
        The cautious tell you not to drive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>, where
        one-way signs are meaningless, parking is impossible, traffic is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">relentless</ENAMEX>, and red and green lights can be purely decorative. They are
        right.
        The face of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> has been made and remade by its many
        earthquakes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">permitting‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇimposing‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtransitions</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gothic</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baroque</ENAMEX>. Many of the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">museums</ENAMEX> still show signs of ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX> and restoration
        after the devastating earthquake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX> and Spaccanapoli
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traffic</ENAMEX> roars down the broad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Corso Umberto I</ENAMEX> to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pivotal Piazza Municipio</ENAMEX> to serve the docks or spin off into the
        commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district</ENAMEX> behind <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Lucia</ENAMEX>, the teeming historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of
        Spaccanapoli, or the residential <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vomero</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Posillipo</ENAMEX>.
        Towering over the long rectangular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> on its south
        side is the massive dry-moated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castel Nuovo</ENAMEX>. Originally the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fortress</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Naples‚Äô French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles d‚ÄôAnjou</ENAMEX>, it was
        rebuilt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 15th century</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aragon</ENAMEX>. Entrance to what is now administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and a communal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> is between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> on the west side, away from the harbor,
        through a fine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> triumphal arch crowned by a statue
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Michael</ENAMEX>.
        Celebrated in song, the old popular harbor district of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Lucia</ENAMEX> is now lined with elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>, many
        overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">formidable medieval Castel dell‚ÄôOvo</ENAMEX> on its own islet,
        with a handful of outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trattorias</ENAMEX> and caf√©s that enjoy a unique
        setting. The waterfront walk at sunset offers timeless views of the bay
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Vesuvius</ENAMEX>, with the contemporary addition of a gleaming-white
        cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. At the workaday <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mergellina</ENAMEX> at the western

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sannazaro</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South of the Piazza Municipio</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via San Carlo</ENAMEX> curves

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Spaniards‚Äô Palazzo Reale</ENAMEX> on the east side of the piazza. The rooms

        18th <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> and reconstructed following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> bomb damage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX>.
        Its sumptuous royal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> are the draw, but it also features

        checkerboard of narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> to the west, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> neighborhood of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX> that is now a mass of dilapidated working-class
        housing and a great opportunity for watching everyday-life.
        Via <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> takes you into the city‚Äôs historic heart,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaccanapoli</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúsplits Naples‚Äù</ENAMEX> into upper and
        lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>). In an area stretching from the permanently
        traffic-jammed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piazza Dante</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via San Biagio dei Librai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribunali</ENAMEX> and over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porta Capuana</ENAMEX>, the popular image of old
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naples</ENAMEX> survives. A permanent festival of laundry hangs across the
        narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gossip</ENAMEX>, business, and family arguments fly between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">balconies</ENAMEX>, while ropes haul up baskets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>, letters, and pet
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>.
        For a sense of the historic neighborhood‚Äôs old splendor,
        start on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza Ges√π Nuovo</ENAMEX>, with its characteristically extravagant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque Immacolata</ENAMEX> column (guglia) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Behind an embossed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fa√ßade</ENAMEX>, the same architectural exuberance continues inside the Jesuit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church</ENAMEX>. But the jewel here, on the south corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX>, is the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Chiara</ENAMEX>, built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of

        additions and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1943</TIMEX> firebombing. The original rose window and elegant
        porch survive and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French Gothic</ENAMEX> interior is beautifully restored. A
        number of sculpted tombs include the sculpted tombs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie de Valois</ENAMEX>
        (on the right) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert the Wise d‚ÄôAnjou</ENAMEX> (d. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1343</TIMEX>; behind the high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">altar</ENAMEX>). Next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> are the lovely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> cloisters
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiostro delle Clarisse</ENAMEX>), converted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1742</TIMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> garden of

        Take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Tribunali</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franciscan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo Maggiore</ENAMEX>, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Baroque</ENAMEX> fa√ßade incorporating the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> marble porch, which was added after the earthquake of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1731</TIMEX>. Inside, the sober <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> Gothic chancel, exceptional in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX>
        for its ambulatory around the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chapels</ENAMEX>, contrasts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chapel</ENAMEX> left of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>.
        The cathedral‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> original <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">portals</ENAMEX> are
        somewhat overpowered by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">neo-Gothic</ENAMEX> fa√ßade. Inside,

        the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> columns survived the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">1688 earthquake</ENAMEX>. At the end of
        the right nave is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth-century</TIMEX> domed baptistery, one of the oldest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> known in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Europe</ENAMEX> with some original mosaics still
        intact. The cathedral‚Äôs richly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque Chapel of San Genaro</ENAMEX> is the

        earthquake. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Scientists</ENAMEX> don‚Äôt have an answer for this one.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museums</ENAMEX>
        The roguish image of the city‚Äôs present might make it easy
        to forget the city‚Äôs glorious past. Luckily, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> truly magnificent
        museums preserve the region‚Äôs treasures from the ravages of earthquake
        and theft.
        Originally a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cavalry barracks</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museo Archeologico Nazionale</ENAMEX>) is in no way a dry
        bundle of old bones and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>, but sheer pleasure for anyone even
        remotely interested in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italy‚Äôs Greek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Etruscan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        past. All visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herculaneum</ENAMEX> should begin or end here,
        since the world-famous collections beautifully display not only the
        paintings and mosaics buried there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly 2,000 years ago</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount</ENAMEX>
        Vesuvius, but a host of other sculptures from the region‚Äôs villas and
        temples, brought here for safe-keeping.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floor</ENAMEX> is devoted to sculpture, including many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> copies of classics from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greece‚Äôs Golden Age</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c.</ENAMEX> , which are our only access to these lost masterpieces. The most
        famous of these is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doryphorus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spear</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polycletus</ENAMEX>, second
        in fame among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> sculptors only to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phidias</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emperors‚Äô Gallery</ENAMEX>
        includes busts and statues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augustus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Claudius</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caracalla</ENAMEX>.
        Most popular are the stunning <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> mosaics and
        Herculaneum bronzes on the mezzanine floor. The lively secular and
        pagan mosaics from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pompeii‚</ENAMEX>Äôs patrician villas make a striking contrast
        with the rigid formality of church mosaics that we see elsewhere in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>. They include <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clients Consulting a Sorceress and Strolling</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musicians</ENAMEX>, vivid little friezes of an octopus, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> catching a quail,
        and the huge exciting mural of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander</ENAMEX> driving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darius of Persia</ENAMEX> from
        the battlefield at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Issus</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">333 b.c.</TIMEX> The paintings here are the best
        preserved of any from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> antiquity‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfrescoes in brilliant blues,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX>, and the inimitable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reds</ENAMEX>. The most celebrated is the
        sophisticated portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paquius Proc¬≠ulus</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Wife</ENAMEX>, depicting an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">interracial</ENAMEX> marriage. Also look for the elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX> and Telephus
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> delicate portraits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artimedes</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flower Gatherer</ENAMEX>. Opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gabinetto Segreto</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Gallery</ENAMEX>)
        displays a small but discerning collection of mosaics and paintings,
        many never before seen because of their controversial nature. It can be
        visited by guided tour only, arranged upon the purchase of your ticket
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museum</ENAMEX> entrance.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capodimonte Museum</ENAMEX>, reopened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, is housed in a
        beautifully restored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hilltop palace</ENAMEX>. The grounds offer a
        welcome rest before and after a visit to the rich and handsomely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-hung collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> paintings.
        Highlights include: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Bellini‚</ENAMEX>Äôs gentle
        Transfiguration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ</ENAMEX> standing serenely between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elijah</ENAMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mantegna‚Äôs Portrait of a Boy</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelangelo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs drawing of Three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Soldiers</ENAMEX> for his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vatican</ENAMEX> fresco of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Peter‚Äôs Crucifixion</ENAMEX>. The Titian
        room contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> of his great works, among them a brilliant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope Paul II</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farnese Nephews</ENAMEX>, the artist‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavinia</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vecellio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip II</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The stark realism you‚Äôll see in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caravaggio‚Äôs Flagellation</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven Works of Mercy</ENAMEX> launched a whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Neapolitan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">‚ÄúCaravaggeschi‚Äù</ENAMEX> displayed here. Most notable among

        It‚Äôs useless to apply for a special permit to bring your

        Camerelle that eventually leads to the famous Punta Tragara lookout and

        symbol of the island‚Äôs beauty.
        Dominating the western (and larger) side of the island,
        the quieter and only slightly less crowded hillside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of Anacapri
        derives a quasi-sleepy charm from its white villas along narrow lanes

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is an intriguing mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baroque</ENAMEX> furniture and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antiquities</ENAMEX>, but the main attraction is the charming garden with its
        trellised arches and dramatic overhang with magical views overlooking
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and the bay. Back at the piazza, take the seggovia chairlift
        for a soaring view of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and some of the mainland on your

        city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasury</ENAMEX>. You can still see plinths from the square‚Äôs statues of

        which is an invaluable adjunct to your visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herculaneum</ENAMEX>.
        At the far end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via</ENAMEX> dell‚ÄôAbbondanza, visit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
        the town‚Äôs best villas: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Loreius Tiburtinus</ENAMEX>, for its

        with its own bathhouse and a handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> of slender marble columns
        around the peristyle. Just to the south is the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amphitheater</ENAMEX>, the
        oldest surviving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, offering a fine view back over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North of the Forum</ENAMEX> area are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pompeii‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mysteries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa dei Misteri</ENAMEX>) is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pompeii‚</ENAMEX>Äôs other most cherished

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">villa</ENAMEX>, most likely the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of a priestess. The brilliant and little

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herculaneum</ENAMEX> is smaller (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a fraction</NUMEX> has been

        better preservation give a more immediate sense of the shape and
        ambience of a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, this one just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 1/2 miles</NUMEX>) from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesuvius</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pompeii</ENAMEX> was incinerated by volcanic cinders, a minimum

        Rediscovered by well-diggers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX>, the town
        is still being excavated, a delicate business as much of it is covered
        by the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ercolano</ENAMEX>. Much of the patrician <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> was unearthed from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1927 to 1962</TIMEX>.
        The entrance off the modern town‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corso Ercolano</ENAMEX> takes
        you around the archaeological site for a striking view down across the
        ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of terraced <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">villas</ENAMEX> from which wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> landowners
        looked out to sea towards <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ischia</ENAMEX> on the horizon. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> principal

        practically laid out with separate areas for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        At the southern end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cardine V</ENAMEX>, the patrician <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of</ENAMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stags</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa dei Cervi</ENAMEX>) is named after its frescoes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stags
        being attacked by hounds. In one of the spacious <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> off the garden
        is a statue of a shockingly drunken <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hercules</ENAMEX>, alleged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furniture</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casa del Mobilio Carbonizzato</ENAMEX>) has a uniquely preserved
        latticed divan bed and small table. Next door, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Neptune</ENAMEX> has
        lost its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs fa√ßade</ENAMEX>, but the ground floor wine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> with its

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wife Amphitrite</ENAMEX>.
        The grandest of the villas, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of the Bicentenary
        (excavated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200 years</TIMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> ‚Äúdig‚Äù in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1738</TIMEX>) stands on the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorrento</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amalfi Coast</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">curving</ENAMEX> along the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> round the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sorrento Peninsula</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salerno</ENAMEX> is one of the most
        romantic and dramatic drives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The sinuous white-knuckle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and its sheer drop of rugged cliffs and ravines tames even
        the most audacious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">olden days</TIMEX>, only brigands and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pirates</ENAMEX> ventured out here, their ruined redoubts and look-out towers
        still dotting the hillsides and promontories. Now, road-side look-outs
        tempt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> and aspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographers</ENAMEX> onto jutting crags high
        above terraces of orange and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon groves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">vineyards</ENAMEX>, walnut, and
        almond <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Surrounded on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> by ravines above the sea, the
        pretty tree-shaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorrento</ENAMEX> still retains something of its
        old-fashioned air, and is still the most popular and best logistic base
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> excursions along the coast and peninsula. Its local
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">craftsmen</ENAMEX> are famous for their inlaid woodwork called intarsia. Compare
        their modern and sadly more commercialized wares with their

        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> to speak of, most travel is by foot up and down its endless

        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most charming and lively of the coast‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts, Amalfi</ENAMEX> was once a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> to the maritime <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republics</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pisa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genoa</ENAMEX>, with trading posts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 10th and 11th centuries</TIMEX> in

        together in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza del Duomo</ENAMEX>, where open-air caf√©s and ice cream

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">campanile</ENAMEX> and polychrome mosaic fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Romanesque cathedral</ENAMEX>,
        built as a symbol of the republic‚Äôs glory. It was begun in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the ninth</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, with its massive bronze doors crafted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Constantinople</ENAMEX> and
        added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>, and the fa√ßade added in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th</TIMEX>, when the
        remains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Andrew the Apostle</ENAMEX> were brought to its crypt from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX>. The interlacing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> arches of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX>
        cloister, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chiostro del Paradiso</ENAMEX>, make a handsome setting for the summer

        Set back on a high <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ridge 362 m</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,184 ft</NUMEX>) above and behind
        A malfi is the tiny and peaceful (but no longer unknown) village of
        Ravello, once a hideout for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> fleeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visigoths</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> it‚Äôs a delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of both modest and elegant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and

        anchored by its imposing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Romanesque cathedral</ENAMEX> built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1076</TIMEX>, is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Rufolo</ENAMEX>, with its mysterious polychrome arcaded arabesque
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cloister</ENAMEX>. Its hanging gardens of exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and
        mesmerizing views were the inspiration for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wagner</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1880</TIMEX> and
        that of his last opera, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Parsifal</ENAMEX>. They are the perfect location for
        outdoor classical concerts that take place during warm weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>.
        Reached by a rambling footpath is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1904</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Villa Cimbrone</ENAMEX>. Its

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salerno</ENAMEX>.
        Paestum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> has no more magnificent testimony of its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        colonies than this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of wonderfully preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doric</ENAMEX> temples, a
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40-minute</TIMEX> drive south from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salerno</ENAMEX>, dating back to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centuries b.c. Standing</ENAMEX> alone in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> leading to the sea, their
        buff-stone columns take on a wonderful golden glow at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sunset</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
        temples loom over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> and residential <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poseidonia</ENAMEX> (as
        it was known before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> era), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">City of Poseidon</ENAMEX>. After the town
        was abandoned to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> invaders in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, the

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>. The most spectacular, directly opposite the entrance to
        the site, is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth-century</TIMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neptune</ENAMEX> (a.k.a.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poseidon</ENAMEX>). The roof has gone, but with its entablature and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> fluted
        columns still standing, it is, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athens‚Äô Theseion</ENAMEX>, the best
        preserved of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> temples. To the south, the more dilapidated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Hera</ENAMEX> (also known, mistakenly, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basilica</ENAMEX>) is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years older</TIMEX> and is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paestum‚</ENAMEX>Äôs oldest, predating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athen‚Äôs Parthenon</ENAMEX> by one
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years</TIMEX>. The northernmost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple of Ceres</ENAMEX> was built around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c.</ENAMEX> , and was later used as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early Middle Ages</TIMEX>, as
        attested by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tombs</ENAMEX>.
        Puglia
        Known to many under its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apulia</ENAMEX>, the region
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stretches from the ‚Äúspur‚Äù</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gargano</ENAMEX> peninsula to the heel of
        Italy‚Äôs boot, endowed with a wild and unspoiled beauty over the gently
        undulating stony plateaus grazed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>. Massive fortresses
        and fortress-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> testify to the passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normans</ENAMEX> and
        then the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> emperors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Middle Ages</TIMEX>. In among the groves of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">olive</ENAMEX>, almond, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">fig trees</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> have been gathered up from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> immemorial to build the smaller, but equally sturdy, corbelled
        trulli that crop up like so many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushroom</ENAMEX> clusters dotting the
        countryside. It is an exotically distant holiday destination popular
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> and the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> tourist, both incredulous that
        this end-of-the-world piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> is still part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
        Gargano <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peninsula</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">peninsula‚Äôs seaside resorts</ENAMEX> have good beaches among
        the pine groves, first-class camping and water-sports facilities, and
        are a base for excursions and hikes into an attractive hinterland of
        rolling hills. The scenic coastal circuit begins (and ends) in
        Manfredonia, with historical attractions such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church of Santa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria di Siponto</ENAMEX> (southwest of town), but tourism here
        is generally of the sun-and-sea kind, as it is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italy‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most
        attractive natural regions.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pugnochiuso</ENAMEX> is among the best of the beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>, along
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vieste</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Emperor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick II</ENAMEX> left a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> from which to

        Vieste climb up the rocky promontory.
        Go inland through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vico</ENAMEX> to join the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> for picnics
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Umbra Forest</ENAMEX>. Perched on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gargano</ENAMEX> heights south of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Sant‚</ENAMEX>ÄôAngelo was a major medieval pilgrimage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>,

        where the archangel appeared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop of Siponto</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sanctuary</ENAMEX> inspired the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mont-Saint-Michel</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bishop Aubert</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gargano</ENAMEX> to collect a
        piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Michael‚Äôs</ENAMEX> red cloak. From a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gothic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">portico</ENAMEX> in the middle
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, beside the massive 13th-¬≠century campanile, a staircase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
        steps takes you down to the sanctuary‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11th-century</TIMEX> bronze doors.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Notice</ENAMEX> to the left of the altar the beautifully carved stone episcopal

        From the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north-coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodi Garganico</ENAMEX>, you can

        Alberobello
        This agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puglia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs famous
        trulli, the white-washed cone-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with ruddy or gray
        dry-stone roofs dotting the landscape like giant spinning tops turned
        upside down. The cone is formed by small limestone slabs set in a
        spiral without mortar to bind them. Though the region‚Äôs oldest
        surviving trulli date back only to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 16th century</TIMEX>, the construction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> is believed by some to be prehistoric, brought here perhaps
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>.
        It is a joy to wander <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alberobello‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> neighborhoods of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trulli</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, and even churches‚<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇRioni Monti</ENAMEX> and Aia

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Locorotondo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selva di Fasano</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest of Alberobello</ENAMEX>, a strada panoramica along a

        Last but not least is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puglia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs crown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lecce</ENAMEX>,
        understandably called <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">‚ÄúThe Baroque Florence‚</ENAMEX>Äù for its plethora of
        16th‚<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Äì18th century</TIMEX> palazzos of local and easily sculpted limestone.
        Foremost is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basilica</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Cross</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Croce</ENAMEX>), the city‚Äôs
        best example of its Baroque heyday, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza del Duomo</ENAMEX>, ringed by

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sicily</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sicilia</ENAMEX>)
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mediterranean‚</ENAMEX>Äôs largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> is in many fascinating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to itself, seemingly not part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> at all,
        and if possible, it deserves a separate and unrushed vacation to do it
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX>. However, for anyone who has <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> to spare for a first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glimpse</ENAMEX>, we suggest some highlights representative of its many facets:
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palermo</ENAMEX>, the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">settlements</ENAMEX>, and the pretty

        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Palermo</ENAMEX>
        This bustling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">capital</ENAMEX> deserves the necessary effort to get
        into its colorful past. Cleverly integrating designs of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and
        Byzantine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> join the

        the chaos of the modern port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. It‚Äôs not always an easy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">love</ENAMEX>, but few leave unimpressed.
        The intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Vittorio Emanuele</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Maqueda</ENAMEX>
        is the town‚Äôs historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quattro Canti</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Four Corners</ENAMEX>), in a

        Cataldo with its three little red <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">domes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> inscriptions. It was
        used for a spell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>. It has been
        restored to its bare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> beauty. Beside it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Gothic La</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martorana</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, partly remodeled with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Baroque fa√ßade</ENAMEX> and porch, has

        The mosaics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apse</ENAMEX> depict <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ Pantocrator</ENAMEX> with the

        design. Its exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> is enhanced by the twin-columned

        famous of the city‚Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> markets. Vendors sing of their wares‚Äô
        quality in the local dialect that is a language all its own, in a
        setting that often feels more like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north Africa</ENAMEX>. Sicily‚Äôs major port
        city offers fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> in shapes and sizes unimagineable, and a
        number of good no-frills trattorias within or near the market promise
        an excellent, inexpensive lunch.
        Monreale
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> suburb <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX>) southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palermo</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boasts Sicily‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">finest cathedral</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th-century</TIMEX>) and one of the best
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">medieval</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mosaic cycles</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Go round to the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> to
        see its wonderful russet and brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> chancel of interlacing arches,
        Gothic rose windows, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> windows with pointed arches. In the
        grandiose interior, the luminous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12th- and 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosaics</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nave</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">apse</ENAMEX> depict the complete cycle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Old Testament</ENAMEX>, replete
        with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">66-ft</NUMEX> high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christ Pantocrator</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">saints</ENAMEX>, while the aisle
        mosaics narrate the miracles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX>. The more warmly-hued human
        figures are believed to be the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venetian</ENAMEX> mosaicists, as opposed
        to the more rigidly formal <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palermo‚</ENAMEX>Äôs Palatine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chapel</ENAMEX>.
        As famous as the mosaics are, the cathedral‚Äôs beautiful
        cloister offers a moment of spiritual meditation along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arcades</ENAMEX> of
        delicate carved twin chevron-fluted columns and an almost sensual
        pleasure among the exotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> fountain of its
        garden. It is understandably a favorite spot for wedding photos.
        Agrigento
        Although known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the famous dramatist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luigi Pirandello</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1867‚Äì1936</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Agrigento‚Äôs Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temples</ENAMEX> (Valle

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century b.c. The Temple of Juno</ENAMEX>, with its sacrificial altar, stands in
        majestic isolation high on a ledge at the eastern end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Sacra</ENAMEX>.
        But it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Concord</ENAMEX> that is the best preserved <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Doric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX>
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sicily</ENAMEX> (if not the world), thanks to its subsequent use as a church
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX> a.d. But the golden glow of the temples‚Äô Doric
        columns and the idyllic setting amid acadia and almond <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">precipice</ENAMEX> overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> are enough to encourage you to
        worship a whole pantheon of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX>. Nearby is the oldest of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">shrines</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">500 b.c.</TIMEX> , whose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight 33</NUMEX>-ft-high
        columns have been re-erected to give some idea of its magnificence.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple Valley</ENAMEX>, next to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 13th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church of San Nicola</ENAMEX>, the small but important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaeological Museum</ENAMEX> has
        a fine marble statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ephebus</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. ), a gigantic

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syracuse</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siracusa</ENAMEX>)
        This east-coast Corinthian settlement, founded in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">734 b.c.</TIMEX>
        , was the most powerful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magna Graecia‚</ENAMEX>Äôs overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> and, under
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dionysius</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">405‚Äì367 b.c.</ENAMEX> ), a direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>. In its heyday, its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> was nearly triple the size of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">today‚Äôs 118,000</NUMEX>. It was here
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third century</TIMEX> b.c. that the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mathematician</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archimedes</ENAMEX> is
        said to have proven his water displacement theory in the bath, and then
        run naked into the street <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crying ‚ÄúEureka‚Äù</ENAMEX> (I have it! ).
        Syracuse‚Äôs original settlement was the port <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> of
        Ortigia, joined by causeway to the mainland. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> pillars surviving from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> stand like a gateway, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish</ENAMEX> era
        has given it a charming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambience</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Baroque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> with
        iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX> supported by floral carvings and an occasional stone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nymph</ENAMEX>. The graceful crescent-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piazza del Duomo</ENAMEX> is the perfect
        place for breakfast surrounded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17th- and 18th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palazzi</ENAMEX> and
        the monumental fa√ßade of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">cathedral</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is in fact a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baroque</ENAMEX>
        elaboration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greeks‚Äô Temple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. ), with
        its columns incorporated into the masonry of the outside walls. On the
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">island‚Äôs</NUMEX> west side, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fontana Aretusa</ENAMEX> is a freshwater <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> (just
        steps from the ocean) with black-and-white ducks swimming in its
        semi-circular papyrus pond.
        The principal excavated site, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zona Archeologica</ENAMEX>, is
        located on the northwest corner of the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Rebuilt by the

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">world</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theater</ENAMEX> dates back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth century</TIMEX> b.c. when
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aeschylus</ENAMEX> himself arrived from his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gela</ENAMEX> to supervise
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">productions</ENAMEX> of his tragedies. A classical drama festival is held here
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>. The nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise Quarry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latomia del Paradiso</ENAMEX>)
        provided the city‚Äôs building materials and is now a pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oleander</ENAMEX> and orange <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. Its popular attraction is the cave called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orecchio di Dionisio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dionysius‚Äô Ear</ENAMEX>), dubbed as such by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caravaggio</ENAMEX> in

        Syracuse‚Äôs history merits the world-class Museo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archeologico Paolo Orsi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viale Teocrito</ENAMEX>). It is arguably the best in
        Sicily, an invaluable one-stop crash course in understanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        and other ancient cultures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and island.
        Taormina
        Sicily‚Äôs most attractive resort <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, already very popular
        in antiquity as a vacation spot for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> bourgeoisie from

        its hillside villas and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>. A popular port-of-call for countless
        cruise lines, the international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> can be avoided for those lucky
        enough to be spending <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> (a funivia cable car connects the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">hilltop</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mazzar√≤ Beach</ENAMEX> below). No <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sicilian</ENAMEX> passeggiata is more

        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corso Umberto</ENAMEX> and out along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via Roma</ENAMEX>, or through the subtropical

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX> along the coast and to the volcano of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Etna</ENAMEX> to the west, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greek Theater</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third century</TIMEX> b.c. ) is the only required site in town.
        It provides a uniquely gorgeous setting‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇif not slightly surreal‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇfor
        the summertime festivals of classical drama, music, and film.
        Excursions further up the mountain take you to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">medieval fortresses</ENAMEX>,
        on foot to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castello di Taormina</ENAMEX> and, by car along a winding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>, to
        Castelmola, for grand views, although the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etna</ENAMEX> is almost
        always swathed in clouds.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount</ENAMEX> Etna
        Europe‚Äôs tallest volcano is still very active, as you‚Äôll
        see from the tell-tale yellow sulphur stains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-eruptions</ENAMEX> as you
        approach the crater, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lava</ENAMEX> beneath your feet is still warm.
        The lunarscape-like summit currently stands at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,350</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,990 ft</NUMEX>)
        above sea level, but varies according to the eruptions‚Äô destruction or
        lava deposits. Because of the erratic nature of the eruptions, the
        approach to the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">crater</ENAMEX> can vary from one eruption to the next
        (serious eruptions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a period of 8 months</TIMEX>). Day
        excursions by bus and special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land Rover</ENAMEX> that connect with a cable car
        originate in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taormina</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catania</ENAMEX>. In any case, the last stretch to the
        crater itself is on foot, so take sturdy shoes and warm <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">clothing‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        cool and windy up there, even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, the
