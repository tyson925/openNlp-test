        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> he fertile <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Valley</ENAMEX> has supported human life for over
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8,000 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> developed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX>,
        growing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barley</ENAMEX> and wheat <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> that originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX>.
        Mesopotamian script was also copied, but it developed into the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX> written language. From the earliest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX> recorded
        their activities on papyrus paper, helping us to piece together the
        pivotal moments in the great <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Egyptian Empire</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Egypt‚</ENAMEX>Äôs complicated annals are filled with massive
        communal building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> and great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> traced through many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">millennia</ENAMEX>. Archaeologists are still debating about the exact chronology
        of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dynasties</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>, however, general
        agreement exists on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of history into set phases, giving a
        name to each. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pre-Dynastic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early</ENAMEX> Dynastic periods are followed
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">New Kingdoms with Intermediate</ENAMEX> periods in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX>. These are followed by the Late, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macedonian</ENAMEX>, and Ptolemaic
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> was absorbed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX> in the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">century a.d.</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pre-Dynastic</ENAMEX> and Early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dynastic Periods</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5000‚Äì2780 b.c.</ENAMEX> )
        For many years <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> was not one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> but two‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇUpper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> in the south and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Egypt</ENAMEX> in the north. It was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3170</TIMEX>
        b.c. that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Narmer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt</ENAMEX>. Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3100</TIMEX>
        b.c. the kingdoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Egypt</ENAMEX> were unified under King
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Menes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇhis crown</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to depict the symbols of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kingdoms</ENAMEX>. He made his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Egypt</ENAMEX> (near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">present-day Cairo</ENAMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> was founded.
        The Old and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle</ENAMEX> Kingdoms
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Kingdom</ENAMEX> was established around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2780</TIMEX> b.c. and lasted
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than five</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX>. It heralded the first great phase of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in science and architecture; hieroglyphs were developed and
        the first great <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> phase took place.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Rulers</ENAMEX> began to grow more powerful and looked for some way
        to prove their might both in life and in death. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Djoser</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourthth Dynasty</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to attempt to build a large funerary
        monument to hold his mortal remains and protect the riches buried with
        him for his next life. The result is the step pyramid at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saqqara</ENAMEX>. Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rulers</ENAMEX> followed suit and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2526</TIMEX> b.c. the design had been perfected and
        the world was graced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Pyramid</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giza</ENAMEX> built for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khufu</ENAMEX> (or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheops</ENAMEX>). Not long before this time, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 2575‚Äì2550</NUMEX> b.c. , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kephren</ENAMEX> had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphinx</ENAMEX> erected in his honor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giza</ENAMEX>. It was at this
        momentous time that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> mummifications began. Khufu‚Äôs son
        Redjedef, made a monumental change to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> life when he introduced
        the solar deity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ra</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Re</ENAMEX>, into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> religion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worship of Ra</ENAMEX>
        would grow to become one of the most important facets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        culture over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 3,000 years</TIMEX>.
        However, during the decisive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2140‚Äì2040 b.c. ,</ENAMEX>
        a split occurred between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingdoms</ENAMEX> when rival power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> arose
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heliopolis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Egypt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thebes</ENAMEX> (modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luxor</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Egypt</ENAMEX>.
        This is what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">archaeologists</ENAMEX> call the first intermediate period. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Karnak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thebes</ENAMEX> was begun around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2134</TIMEX> b.c. , marking the city‚Äôs
        rise to prominence.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Kingdom</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2040‚Äì1801</NUMEX> b.c. , commenced with Theban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">rulers of the 11th Dynasty</ENAMEX> attempting to extend their control, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> was reunified under <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Mentuhotep</ENAMEX> II. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> built a power
        base at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thebes</ENAMEX>, and started a cultural renaissance with wide-reaching
        effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> art and archaeology. The local <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Theban god Amon</ENAMEX>
        became intertwined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ra</ENAMEX> creating the deity <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amon Ra</ENAMEX> and around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1800</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c.</ENAMEX> , the female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Osiris cult</ENAMEX> developed into a main deity. Thebes held
        onto power until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dynasty</ENAMEX>, when its first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amenemhet Iwho</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">reigned</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 1980‚Äì1951 b.c.</TIMEX> established a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX>.
        However, he continued to give prominence to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theban god Amon</ENAMEX>,
        ensuring that the worship spread across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>.
        But other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rival peoples</ENAMEX> coveted the riches of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and
        near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX> b.c. , a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hyskos</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Egypt</ENAMEX> from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>, splitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and starting the second
        intermediate period.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Kingdom</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1540‚Äì1100 b.c.</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyskos</ENAMEX> rule lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 100 years</TIMEX>. They were driven
        out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lower Egypt</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahmose</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> who founded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dynasty</ENAMEX>, ruling
        over a united <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> from a capital at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thebes</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pharaohs</ENAMEX> of the 18th
        Dynasty instigated many important reforms. They reorganized the army
        and consolidated power in the hands of family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> at the expense of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">feudal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artistically</ENAMEX> and culturally <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> reached its zenith
        during the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Kingdom</ENAMEX> and many of the most renowned Pharaohs reigned
        during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley of the Kings</ENAMEX> was also chosen as a new
        burial ground for the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pharaohs</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tuthmoses I</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1504‚Äì1492 b.c.</ENAMEX> ) was
        entombed in a narrow valley across the river from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">temple</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Karnak</ENAMEX>.
        Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1400s</TIMEX> (b.c. ) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Karnak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX> temples were
        greatly expanded and several huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building projects</ENAMEX> took place on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">west</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>. However in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1356‚Äì1339</NUMEX> b.c. a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharaoh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amenophis IV</ENAMEX>,
        decided to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thebes</ENAMEX> and, with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nefertiti</ENAMEX>, created a new
        capital on a virgin site at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tell El Amarna</ENAMEX> to the north. He introduced
        a monotheistic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> around the one true god‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇAten‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> changed his
        name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akhenaten</ENAMEX> (‚ÄúHe who pleases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aten</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚Äù</ENAMEX> ). This sudden change
        brought chaos to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and she lost international influence, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Akhenaten‚Äôs successor‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇhis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>, the young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Tutankhamun‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇbrought</ENAMEX> power
        back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thebes</ENAMEX> and reinvested the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amon Ra</ENAMEX> and his fellow
        gods with religious supremacy.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutankhamun</ENAMEX> died in mysterious circumstances without an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heir</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warrior successor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramses</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX>, heralded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the 19th</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> to be followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seti</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I 1291‚Äì1279</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">b.c.</ENAMEX> who won back many of
        the lands lost during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Akhenaten years</TIMEX>.
        The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-year</TIMEX> rule of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1279‚Äì1212 b.c.</ENAMEX> ) was a great
        finale to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Kingdom</ENAMEX> era. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most prolific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> in the
        history of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> ruled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 60 years</TIMEX> and supervised magnificent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luxor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Karnak temples</ENAMEX> and creating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">magnificent Abu Simbel</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> now postulate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses II</ENAMEX> was
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pharoah</ENAMEX> of biblical fame who let the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> leave his land
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>.
        Following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ramses II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramses III</ENAMEX> built a vast mortuary
        complex at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medinet Habu</ENAMEX> but power was already slipping from royal hands
        into those of the exclusive and secretive priesthood known as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amun-Ra</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1070</TIMEX> b.c. the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was split again and
        foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> began to overrun the borders. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">715</NUMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> was
        already dominated by foreign power‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthe Assyrians‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> also began
        increasing trade and diplomacy with the expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Empire</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptolemaic Period</ENAMEX>
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">332</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c. Alexander the Great</ENAMEX> occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and
        appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleomenes of Naucratis</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macedonian</ENAMEX> general, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>. Then, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander‚</ENAMEX>Äôs death in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">323</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleomenes</ENAMEX> took control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptolemy I.</ENAMEX>
        The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, located on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> coast, became
        the base for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ptolemaic</ENAMEX> control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and the cultural capital of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe,‚ÄÇand Thebes</ENAMEX> finally lost its influence. However, the Ptolemies
        were responsible for building and refurbishing several important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">temples</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper Egypt</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denderah, Philae</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edfu</ENAMEX>. They
        adopted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gods</ENAMEX> as their own and did much to prolong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian</ENAMEX>
        culture rather than simply converting it to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Ptolemaic</ENAMEX> era came to an end with its most famous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ruler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Cleopatra</ENAMEX>. During her lifetime, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69‚Äì30</NUMEX> b.c. , the infamous
        queen attempted to link her land to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> through her liaison with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julius Caesar</ENAMEX>. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> Caesarean would have ruled over both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, thus continuing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> line. However, events
        turned profoundly against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caesar</ENAMEX> was suddenly killed and
        she fled back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX> to commit suicide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> b.c. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> was
        reduced to a provincial status in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>, as it was ruled first
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> and subsequently from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Constantinople</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> was caught up in the first wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moslem Arab</ENAMEX>
        expansion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 630s</TIMEX> (a.d. ), less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> after the death of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prophet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed</ENAMEX>. His teachings were encapsulated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koran</ENAMEX> and
        they fired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the</TIMEX>,previously disparate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> to spread the word of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allah</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> became one of the most influential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, especially
        when, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-9th century</TIMEX>, a more powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">force‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe

        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>.
        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two centuries</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> became a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of
        culture and learning that was unsurpassed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world with the
        establishment of the renowned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El-Azhar University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1169</TIMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatimids</ENAMEX> were crushed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saladin‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalready</ENAMEX> flush with

        and created the fortified citadel to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>. However Ayyubid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> was weak and power was usurped by their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX>, called
        mamelukes, who succeeded in founding a dynasty that lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1251</TIMEX> to
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1517</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> they built vast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> and ornate mosques, and expanded
        the influence of the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khan el-Khalili</ENAMEX> market to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egypt‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        trading power.
        Mameluke power was taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1517</TIMEX>, but
        little changed on a day-to-day basis as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turks</ENAMEX> preferred to use
        local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to control their more remote dominions. They appointed an

        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> went into chronic terminal decline in the 18th
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">century</ENAMEX>, with a series of crises that local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mamelukes</ENAMEX> were unable to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>.
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> control weakened, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> became a pawn in a
        larger game. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1798</TIMEX> a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleon Bonaparte</ENAMEX>, eager to curtail
        growing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> power, arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and after a short and decisive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">battle</ENAMEX> claimed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>. He set about forming a ruling
        body, and sent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> out into the countryside to explore
        and record its ancient treasures‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇthus sparking the great interest in
        Egyptology among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>. His
        stay was short-lived however; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> were after him and
        inflicted a devastating defeat on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Navy</ENAMEX> at the battle of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aboukir</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later the same year</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> went home to claim ‚Äòvictory‚Äô but
        he had to leave the bulk of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> behind. Meanwhile an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> force
        had been dispatched from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> to counter the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>. They were led
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX>, a brilliant intellect who, in the aftermath of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> withdrawal, asked to be appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Pasha</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sultan</ENAMEX> agreed to his request and he set about establishing his power
        base. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1811</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed</ENAMEX> organized a grand banquet and called all the
        notable mamelukes to attend. Once they were all at his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> he had
        them massacred‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtheir influence had come to a sudden, bloody end.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX> had a vision for his new domain. He admired
        western military tactics and set about modernizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX> and commerce were brought up-to-date and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> was
        introduced as a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> saw a rash of new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that
        expanded the city‚Äôs boundaries. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> grew wealthy and
        powerful, twice declaring war on his sovereign and almost beating the
        sizeable but dissolute <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>. Istanbul was forced to recognize
        this powerful thorn in its side as a semi-autonomous part of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">empire</ENAMEX>, and granted hereditary status to the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pasha</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>.
        Later the title was upgraded to khedive, the equivalent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viceroy</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Ali</ENAMEX>, however, ultimately failed to
        live up to its founder‚Äôs great achievements, as the ruling body
        increasingly grew to be corrupt and recklessly irresponsible. The one
        great feat that was achieved during their sovereignty, though, was the
        creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX>, an engineering marvel of its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> that
        opened with great aplomb in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1869</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khedive Ismael</ENAMEX> had extravagant
        plans for numerous great works that were to be financed by Western
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> powers, but when he became stuck in a financial quagmire, they
        insisted on bringing in their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> to control key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> soon had an unassailable grip on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> politics and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">20th Century</ENAMEX>
        As <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> power-brokering turned into <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>
        became vital to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX>, being close to the enemy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heartland</ENAMEX>, and allowing quick passage through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX> to her
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dominions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX>. When the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> crumbled in the aftermath of the war, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> declared
        itself an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX>, but real power remained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. A
        strong independence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wafd</ENAMEX>, gained political power during the
        1920s and became a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few decades</TIMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II Hitler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mussolini</ENAMEX> recognized that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suez Canal</ENAMEX> was vital to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> plans, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Egypt‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalong</ENAMEX> with the rest
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇbecame an important field of battle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> were
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 150 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> finally
        gained the upper hand following the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> victory at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">El Alemain</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1942</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> remained firmly in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> hands for the rest of the
        war.
        Post-war politics brought a new set of problems. The new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> founded on land so recently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Palestine</ENAMEX>
        sent shock waves through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> world and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> found itself at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of a bloody defeat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX> when it stood up against its new
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Farouk</ENAMEX>, who had come to the throne in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1936</TIMEX>, was seen as
        a playboy with a love of luxurious living. When he attempted to restore
        national pride by wresting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> hands he
        suffered an embarrassing diplomatic defeat and, at home, unrest turned
        to opposition.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1952</TIMEX> a group of high-ranking military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>
        declared a military coup. Led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gamal Abdel Nasser</ENAMEX>, they drove
        Farouk into exile and nationalized the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasser</ENAMEX> was to rule
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 years</TIMEX> during which, with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">help</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> embarked on a huge
        modernization program. Chief among its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Aswan High Dam</ENAMEX>,
        which provided hydroelectricity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and freed the country
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scourge</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> river flood, bringing security to the
        highly populated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nile Delta</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anwar el-Sadat</ENAMEX> succeeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasser</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>. He was not as
        charismatic as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nassar</ENAMEX> and, though he had a more moderate stance, became
        embroiled in several unsuccessful short wars with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> that severely
        weakened the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and left the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai region</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> hands.
        Limited success in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> restored some national pride when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> was
        returned, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadat</ENAMEX> was aware that his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> could be bled dry if the
        conflict continued. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to
        recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israel‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇother Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were aghast and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sadat</ENAMEX> grew. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX> he was assassinated by an
        army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> while taking the salute at a military parade.
        Since then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosny Mubarak</ENAMEX> has been Egypt‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. He has
        worked hard to find a place for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> at the negotiation table, acting
        as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderator</ENAMEX> and offering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> as a venue for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> peace
        talks throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 80s and 90s</TIMEX>. Mubarak‚Äôs pragmatic approach has
        earned him many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">admirers</ENAMEX>, but also some enemies‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnot least among them,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> within his own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> they made numerous
        attempts to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-stabilize his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, finally resorting to attacking the
        mainstay of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">economy‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇtourism ‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇand several despicable
        attacks on foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 60</NUMEX> deaths. A number of
        trials are said to have put the instigators in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> and security
        measures have been enhanced, but their actions did a great deal of
        damage from which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> will be slow to recover. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tourism</ENAMEX> numbers fell
        dramatically but are now rising again as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> grow more confident.
        Meanwhile the vast majority of ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX>, who offer a warm
        welcome to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, put their faith in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Allah</ENAMEX> for an upturn in their
        economic fortunes.
