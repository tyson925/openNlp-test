        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Humans</ENAMEX> inhabited the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Balearic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">archipelago</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 5000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b.c.</ENAMEX> , having most likely journeyed to the islands from the coast of
        mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Neolithic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> lived in caves and rock <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelters</ENAMEX>,
        examples of which can still be seen on both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menorca</ENAMEX>, and
        hunted the only large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> on the islands, a type of mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">goat</ENAMEX>,
        now extinct. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balearic Islands</ENAMEX> are strewn with rocks and
        boulders, and these early <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peoples</ENAMEX> built simple stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and cleared
        fields by piling the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> into dividing walls.
        Another skill with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> was evident in the islanders‚Äô
        deadly use of the sling, which brought them onto the world stage and
        into written history. Indeed, the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearic</ENAMEX> may come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        ballein, ‚Äúto throw. ‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians</ENAMEX> absorbed the islands into their
        trading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> and founded the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>, but they quickly learned to
        respect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slingers</ENAMEX>, eventually recruiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> into their
        armies. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">123</NUMEX> b.c. the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> had pacified most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> and sent out
        an invading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. Having conquered the islands, they named them
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balearis Major‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearis Minor‚ÄÇ</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> built <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and established <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, including the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towns of Palmaria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma) and Pollentia</ENAMEX> (near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">present-day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alc√∫dia</ENAMEX>). In
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX> crumbled, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> called barbarians by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Romans‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇGoths</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vandals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Visigoths‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇpoured</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. The
        Vandals, who destroyed almost all evidence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> occupation,
        settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX>, becoming a sea power. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> expedition
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Constantinople</ENAMEX> ousted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vandals</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">534</NUMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tide</ENAMEX> of Islam
        Ignited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabian</ENAMEX> peninsula by the teachings of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prophet Muhammad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> spread like wildfire, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> reaching
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">683</NUMEX>. Determined to impose their new
        religion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, a predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general Tarik</ENAMEX> landed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> peninsula in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">711</TIMEX>. In just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> nearly all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> rule.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world, which reached from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> to the
        Pyrenees, soon fragmented, with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> becoming an independent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caliphate</ENAMEX>. Under tolerant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>, the capital city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> was
        transformed into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs greatest centers of scholarship and
        the arts. At first the caliphs were content to accept tribute from the
        Balearics, without imposing Islam. But by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">848</NUMEX> disturbances in the
        islands prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> to deploy their newly expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX>; the
        Emir of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C√≥rdoba</ENAMEX> conquered both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> at the beginning of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 11th century</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caliphate</ENAMEX> had splintered
        into a mosaic of fractious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">states‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇ‚<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Äî‚ÄÇ26</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point, and the Balearics
        became an independent emirate.
        The Reconquest
        The aim of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusades</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was the eviction of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>. After the recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1099</TIMEX>, it took <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four hundred</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles,
        before <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">kings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX> succeeded in subduing the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>.
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 September 1229</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catalan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume</ENAMEX> I of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catalunya</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mallorcan</ENAMEX> shore near the present-day
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resort of Santa Pon√ßa.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> retreated inside the walls of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX>, but on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last day of 1229</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> fell, and pockets of
        resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to
        be an enlightened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> who profited from the talents of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moors‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇconverted</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Christianity‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇas well as of the island‚Äôs
        large <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genoese</ENAMEX> trading <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Mallorca prospered.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speedily</ENAMEX> agreed to pay an annual
        tribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX> and were left in peace. The island‚Äôs tranquility
        lasted until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1287</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso III</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX>, smarting over a series
        of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for
        invasion. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX> were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mallorca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Menorca‚Äôs</ENAMEX> economy was devastated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>.
        Jaume I died after reigning in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six decades</TIMEX>, but
        he made the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cardinal</ENAMEX> error of dividing between his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> the lands he
        had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an
        Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Mallorca</ENAMEX>, under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Jaume II</ENAMEX>, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San√ß</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume III</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> rivalry triggered the overthrow of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume III</ENAMEX> by
        his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro IV</ENAMEX>, who then seized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX>.
        Attempting a comeback, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaume</ENAMEX> was killed in battle near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Llucmajor</ENAMEX> in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1349</TIMEX>.
        A newly unified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Spain</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX>
        Monarchs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX>, completed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reconquest</ENAMEX>, defeating
        the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moorish</ENAMEX> enclave left on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX> peninsula, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX>. However, the centralized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> failed to incorporate the
        Balearics politically or economically.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Empire</ENAMEX>
        As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one tumultuous age</TIMEX> ended, one of glory and greed began.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX>, the seafaring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genoa</ENAMEX> (whom at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mallorcan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> claim as their own) believed he could reach the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">East Indies</ENAMEX> by sailing westwards. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same year</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> fell,
        Columbus crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, landing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> islands.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> exported its adventurers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priests</ENAMEX>, and
        imposed its language, culture, and religion on the New World, creating
        a vast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruthless</ENAMEX>, avaricious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conquistadores‚ÄÇextracted</ENAMEX> and sent back incalculable riches of silver
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1492</TIMEX> has been called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">‚ÄúGolden Age</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù However, the era carried the seeds of its own decline.
        Plagued by corruption and incompetence, and drained of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manpower</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> by such adventurism as the dispatch of the ill-fated Armada
        against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1588</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was unable to defend her expansive
        interests. Burgeoning trade in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> was interrupted by
        marauding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Africa</ENAMEX> as well as by the powerful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Ties and Occupation</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> married the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown</ENAMEX> duly passed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hapsburgs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> remained in their hands
        until the feeble-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos II</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1700</TIMEX>, leaving no heir. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
        seized the chance to install the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louis XIV</ENAMEX> on the
        Spanish throne.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hapsburg</ENAMEX> claimant was supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, who saw a powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> as a major threat.
        In the subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War of the Spanish Succession</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1702‚ÄÇ‚Äì1713</ENAMEX>) most of
        the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arag√≥n</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>, backed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hapsburgs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> seized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gibraltar‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇin the name of the Hapsburg
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">claimant‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇand</ENAMEX> retained it when the war was over. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1708</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">captured Menorca</ENAMEX>, and the magnificent harbor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mah√≥n</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ma√≥</ENAMEX>), for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Navy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">England</ENAMEX> clung to it even when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourbon</ENAMEX> forces captured
        Mallorca at the end of the war.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> changed hands between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> more times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a century</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> finally ceded the
        island to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1802</TIMEX>, under the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Treaty</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amiens</ENAMEX>.
        By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1805</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was once more aligned with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> fought alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trafalgar</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Napoleon</ENAMEX> came to distrust his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> and forcibly replaced the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">king</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> with his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Bonaparte</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> army
        marched in to subdue the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> resisted and, aided by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> commanded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wellington</ENAMEX>, drove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
        out. What <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> call the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Peninsular War</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1808‚Äì1814</ENAMEX>) is
        known in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">War</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Independence</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>, practically all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs possessions
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Americas</ENAMEX> broke away in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Napoleonic Wars</ENAMEX>, and the
        few that remained were lost at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 19th century</TIMEX>. The
        Balearics, further neglected, were beset with poverty and outbreaks of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. However, toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</TIMEX>, things began to improve on
        the islands, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> reaping the rewards of successful
        agricultural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> launching an export shoe industry.
        The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beginning of the 20th century</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> was marked by
        still more crises, assassinations, and near anarchy. The colonial war
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> provided an almost welcome distraction, but a disastrous
        defeat there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1921</TIMEX> led to a coup in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primo de Rivera</ENAMEX>
        became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> fell in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1929</TIMEX>, and when the elections of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1931</TIMEX> revealed massive anti-royalist feeling in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain‚Äôs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, the king
        followed him into exile.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Civil War</ENAMEX>
        The new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX> was conceived amid an orgy of strikes,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">church-burnings</ENAMEX>, and uprisings of the right and left. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1936</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">te</ENAMEX> left-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Front</ENAMEX> won a majority of seats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cortes</ENAMEX>, but
        across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> new extremes of violence displaced argument.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1936</TIMEX>, most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Francisco</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇwith the support of the monarchists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservatives</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clergy</ENAMEX>, and the right-wing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falange‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇrose</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>. Aligned on the government‚Äôs side were the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">socialists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX>, and anarchists. The ensuing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Spanish Civil War</ENAMEX> was brutal and bitter, and support for both sides
        poured in from outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Many saw it as a contest between
        democracy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX>, or, from the other side, between order and
        Red chaos. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fascist Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nazi Germany</ENAMEX> backed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Franco‚Äôs Nationalists</ENAMEX>,
        while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> (although less and
        less towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the war</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Volunteers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
        arrived to fight on the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX>. The war lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>; perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> lost their lives.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menorca</ENAMEX> found themselves on opposite sides
        during the war. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> declared itself for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>, and stayed
        with it to the bitter end. Mallorca‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garrison</ENAMEX> seized it for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nationalists</ENAMEX>. Early in the war, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> used their one
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">battleship</ENAMEX> to support an invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>, but it ended in failure.
        A decisive factor was the presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> air squadrons,
        used to bomb republican <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Horizons</ENAMEX>
        Exhausted after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Civil War</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> remained on the
        sidelines during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> and began to recover economically under
        the oppressive, law-and-order regime of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>. There had been a
        foretaste of elite foreign tourism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, but it was the late
        1950s when the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> began sun-seeking pilgrimages to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
        Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration, transforming the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> economy, landscape, and society. Eager to capitalize, the
        country poured its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> into mass tourism, which triggered a rash of
        indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines, with
        scant regard for tradition or aesthetics. But after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">so many years</TIMEX>
        closed off from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, of equal significance was the
        injection of foreign influences into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Franco‚Äôs</ENAMEX> once hermetically sealed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> in particular saw explosive growth in
        tourism; by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> were one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most popular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">holiday</ENAMEX> destinations.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> named as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonso XIII</ENAMEX>,
        who was enthroned as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Carlos</ENAMEX> I when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictator</ENAMEX> died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>.
        To the dismay of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> diehards, the king brilliantly managed the
        transition to democracy, then stood back to allow it full rein, even
        intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>
        of repression, new freedoms and autonomy were granted to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish</ENAMEX>
        regions, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>, and their languages and cultures
        enjoyed a long-desired renaissance.
        More a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> than ever before, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> joined the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> (now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, giving further boost
        to a booming economy. The tourist industry continued to expand, and
        though it became one of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">earners</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, a
        realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging
        long-term consequences also began to grow. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX>, a new
        emphasis on quality and, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>, on safeguarding
        the environment had finally taken root‚Äîtoo late for many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">environmentalists</ENAMEX>, but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the
        natural beauty and unique <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">character</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Las Islas Baleares</ENAMEX>.
