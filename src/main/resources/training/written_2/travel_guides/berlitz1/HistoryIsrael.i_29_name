        The land we know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> has had many names during
        its history. In ancient times it was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canaan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilistia</ENAMEX> (coastal land
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philistines</ENAMEX>), then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Judea</ENAMEX>, before reverting to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine</ENAMEX> (the name ultimately derived from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philistines</ENAMEX>). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>
        the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">State of Israel</ENAMEX> was proclaimed.
        Early Times
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cave dwellers</ENAMEX> were the earliest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> of the region,
        especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carmel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haifa</ENAMEX>) area. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> real settlements,
        founded in the Late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Age</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c.7500 b.c. ‚Äì‚ÄÇ4000 b.c.</ENAMEX> ), included the
        world‚Äôs oldest walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jericho</ENAMEX>. This was also the time when people
        started rearing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, irrigating the land, and making pottery. By
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early Bronze Age</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">c.3200 b.c. ‚Äì2200 b.c.</ENAMEX> ), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had begun
        fortifying their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, building temples and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX>, and founding the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> city-states.
        It was also the time when the region was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canaanites</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> familiar from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX>, which is still the
        best source of knowledge about ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. It tells us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham</ENAMEX>
        made a covenant with God which called for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">descendants</ENAMEX> to conquer
        many lands. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham, the first Patriarch</ENAMEX>, led his nomadic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        Israelites from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesopotamia</ENAMEX> to the mountains of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canaan</ENAMEX>, where they
        fought the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX>. Eventually famine compelled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abraham‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> to move into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and into captivity. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1250</TIMEX> b.c. ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israelites‚</ENAMEX>Äô new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, parted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX> and led his
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canaan</ENAMEX> to confront the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philistines</ENAMEX>, who now controlled
        much of the land. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> died on the journey to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promised Land</ENAMEX>, but
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua</ENAMEX> took over from him, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1400 b.c. and 1000</TIMEX> b.c. the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> conquered all the lands north and south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>,
        most famously bringing the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Jericho</ENAMEX> tumbling down with the
        sounds of their horns. At this time only the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> area was known as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>; the south was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judah</ENAMEX>. In its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> form, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Judea</ENAMEX>, it was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to just <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and its immediate surroundings.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 1023</TIMEX> b.c. , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
        elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul</ENAMEX> to be their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse</ENAMEX>, later
        became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">king</ENAMEX> and conquered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, the last undefeated place in the
        whole territory, and made it his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal City</ENAMEX>. He also strengthened the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and brought in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ark</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covenant</ENAMEX> (holding the Ten
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commandments</ENAMEX>) to sanctify it as a holy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and to unite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX>.
        His <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> prospered, and by the time his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX> succeeded him,
        in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 965 b.c.</TIMEX> , almost all the extensive, rich lands between the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rivers Nile</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Euphrates</ENAMEX> were part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Israel</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Solomon</ENAMEX> ruled during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and is
        remembered for his wisdom, for the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Temple</ENAMEX>,
        and for his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">copper mines</ENAMEX> in the south. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37 years</TIMEX> of rule, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solomon</ENAMEX>
        died and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> was split between the northern and southern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribes</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 721 b.c.</TIMEX> , the north (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>) was invaded and
        devastated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assyrians</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> were then scattered to
        roam the world as the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ten Lost Tribes</ENAMEX>. Even more devastating was the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">587</NUMEX> b.c. invasion by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebuchadnezzar</ENAMEX>-led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babylonians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">razed</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> destroyed, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> forced into exile and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">slavery</ENAMEX>.
        By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth century</TIMEX> b.c. the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babylonians</ENAMEX> had been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overthrown</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israelites</ENAMEX> returned to their land, which was now
        under the more tolerant rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> were
        followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander the Great</ENAMEX>, after whom came <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seleucus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptolemy</ENAMEX>, who brought <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hellenistic</ENAMEX> control to the Eastern
        Mediterranean for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some two centuries</TIMEX>. Around a.d. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">141</NUMEX>, the three
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maccabee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> overthrew the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seleucids</ENAMEX> and established their own
        Hasmonean dynasty and an extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX> which dominated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine</ENAMEX> as
        far as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golan</ENAMEX> in the north and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza</ENAMEX> in the south.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> b.c. swept aside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">b.c. Herod the Great</ENAMEX>, whose engineering
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feats</ENAMEX> and brutality became legendary, was installed as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judea</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 b.c.</NUMEX> (his birth was
        miscalculated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixth century</TIMEX>), though it was only in the final
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> of his life and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> that his teachings became a major
        problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>. Ironically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> was condemned not by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romans</ENAMEX>, but by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanhedrin</ENAMEX>, the supreme <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>,
        largely because of his ‚Äúblasphemous‚Äù declaration that he was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Son of</ENAMEX>
        God. After his crucifixion, the rather precarious balance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
        government under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> rule turned to revolt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 66</TIMEX>, when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zealots</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. They held it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only four years</TIMEX>, but the city
        was razed once again (just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> had prophesied), the fortress of
        Masada fell, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> were again taken into exile and slavery.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> culture nonetheless survived the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> destruction of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>. Its centre moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiberias</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galilee</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a.d. 331</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constantine</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emperor</ENAMEX>, legalised
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christianity</ENAMEX> and together with his mother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen</ENAMEX>, developed and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">excavated Christian</ENAMEX> sites. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilgrim</ENAMEX> interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX> (as it was
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> called at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>) began on a massive scale that has continued
        to this day. Thus began a period of prosperity which was only brought
        to a violent end in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">614</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> invaded. Once again <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Judea</ENAMEX>
        was conquered by foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> reduced to rubble.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX>
        In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">622</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> was born, according to the teachings of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prophet Mohammed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> swiftly conquered the whole of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. By <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">638</NUMEX> they controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, and with the
        construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dome of the Rock and the El-Aksa Mosque</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> this became the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-holiest of all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> (after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medina</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> rule was largely tolerant, and continued peacefully
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly four centuries</TIMEX> with a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> protectorate of
        Holy <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Places</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1009</TIMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> were destroyed by the fanatical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caliph</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hakim</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1071</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Seljuk Turks</ENAMEX> took over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>
        and began attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilgrims</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> called on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to launch a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crusade</ENAMEX> to defend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1099</TIMEX>, under
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godfrey de Bouillon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. Their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">brutality</ENAMEX> was legendary; <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> fared no better than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> and were
        massacred as ‚ÄúGod <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killers</ENAMEX>. ‚Äù The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crusaders</ENAMEX> set up their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and began another <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Crusade</ENAMEX> to gain more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX>. They
        managed to control much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly a century</TIMEX> before the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saladin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Salah</ENAMEX>-ad-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Din</ENAMEX>) defeated them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1187</TIMEX>. A year
        later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard the Lionheart</ENAMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Third Crusade</ENAMEX>,
        won back <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akko</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Acre</ENAMEX>) but failed to regain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. Other Crusades
        followed, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knights</ENAMEX> never recovered their earlier territories,
        and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the 13th century</TIMEX> were faced with a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mamelukes</ENAMEX> to Zionism
        Akko fell to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mamelukes</ENAMEX> (freed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slaves</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>/Circassian origin) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1291</TIMEX>, bringing to an end the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusader</ENAMEX>
        period. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mame¬≠lukes</ENAMEX> ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two hundred years</TIMEX>, leaving
        behind some very fine architecture.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1516</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman</ENAMEX> dynasty conquered the whole of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX>, extending their <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle-Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>.
        Their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sultan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suleiman</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnificent</ENAMEX>), is renowned for
        constructing new walls and gates and roughly reshaping the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old City</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> into its modern form. During his reign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> flourished,
        but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successors</ENAMEX> proved less able, and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next four centuries</TIMEX>
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> continuously declined to become a virtual backwater.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decades of the 19th century</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jews</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diaspora</ENAMEX> seeking refuge from persecution immigrated to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1878</TIMEX> the first modern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> was founded at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosh</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pina</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">in 1896 Theodore Herzl</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zionism</ENAMEX> movement
        that called for the creation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, published
        his sem¬≠inal work, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Jewish State</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Mandate</ENAMEX>
        Around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and other countries
        had noted with great interest the developments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, and during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> courted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> for help to get rid of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX>. They promised to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a national <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>
        and to the other protection of their rights, as set out in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1917</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Balfour Declaration</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> surrendered when <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War I</ENAMEX> ended the
        following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, and, following a declaration by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League of Nations</ENAMEX>
        (the forerunner to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine</ENAMEX> by mandate. A massive inflow of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> from around
        the world followed, increasing tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX>. In spite
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> attempts to appease both sides, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">settlers</ENAMEX> became common, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> retaliated, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> imposed
        restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> immigration. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> underground resistance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irgun</ENAMEX>) was set up to fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> and smuggle more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>, persecution of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> forced even
        greater numbers to flee to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holy Land</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>, such as
        Haifa, were blockaded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> to prevent more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>
        from flooding in. <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> into an
        alliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> against the common <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Nazi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. Even so, by
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX> immigration had swollen the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to such an extent
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX> now outnumbered <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">600,000 to 200,000</NUMEX>), and
        the violence continued to escalate. Unable to solve ‚Äúthe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestinian</ENAMEX>
        problem,‚Äù the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> presented it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, whose
        solution was to partition the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territories</ENAMEX>. According
        to this plan, areas that were predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arab‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇthe <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX>, the
        central part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, the northwest corner, and the West
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bank‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwere</ENAMEX> to remain under <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> control as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, while the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern Negev Des¬≠ert</ENAMEX> and the northern coastal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> would form the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">new State of Israel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, the most fiercely disputed real-estate,
        came under international protection.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">State of Israel</ENAMEX>
        On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14 May 1948</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Mandate</ENAMEX> ended and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> was proclaimed. Immediately the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> war erupted,
        with the new state engaged in fighting the combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of war the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> interceded
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> a peace agreement. Israel‚Äôs boundaries were redrawn and
        expanded to almost what they are now, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian Arab</ENAMEX>
        territories were reduced to the central<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">-eastern area</ENAMEX>, known as the West
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> (of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordan River</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> was divided
        into east and west, under the control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
        respectively.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">settlers</ENAMEX> still flooded into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, and new
        settlements continued to be built. But the young <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> was soon engaged
        in another crisis with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> neighbour. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gamal Nasser‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        nationalization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Suez Canal</ENAMEX> international waters triggered a
        combined <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, and the start of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Sinai War</ENAMEX>. The outcome was further territorial gains for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israel</ENAMEX>
        with control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX>. However, strong
        international pressure forced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> to withdraw‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwith <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>
        reclaiming the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> installed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">No fewer than eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> passed before the next major
        Arab-Israeli conflict flared. As <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies</ENAMEX> massed on the borders of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> destroyed the air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> with a preemptive strike. The war was
        over in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> gained total control of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaza</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Bank</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt‚Äôs Sinai</ENAMEX> and
        Syria‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golan Heights</ENAMEX>.
        Attempting to regain the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syria</ENAMEX> struck back at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiest day</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jewish</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Yom Kippur</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> was caught off guard but held out on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">front</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a month</TIMEX>. Finally, peace was agreed, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX>
        buffer zone created in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Golan Heights</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> made an important movement towards a
        permanent peace between an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> when they agreed to a
        treaty in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>. Yet, further military action lay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> away. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> invaded southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leba¬≠non</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> to safeguard its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">northern</ENAMEX> border against attack by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine Liberation</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> then penetrated north to bombard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX>
        positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>. They forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> out, but without much support
        within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intifada</ENAMEX> to the Present
        A fatal road incident in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1987</TIMEX>
        set off the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intifada</ENAMEX> (uprising) against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Occupied Territories</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone</ENAMEX> throwing and petrol bombing were
        early <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, but subsequently the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian Fundamentalist</ENAMEX> movement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamas</ENAMEX> took to other forms of anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> violence, such as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>
        suicide bombing of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX> bus which resulted in the death of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
        More traumatic to the hard-bitten <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> was the
        launching of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scud</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haifa</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1990‚Äì91</NUMEX>. Little physical damage was inflicted, but the psychological
        effect was significant. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> couldn‚Äôt even retaliate, being
        restrained by pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, which wanted to
        preserve the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
        The most dramatic recent changes in the relationship
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jew</ENAMEX> became public in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX> peace accord
        was finally made between former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> (acknowledged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
        The accord allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jericho</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> a limited form of
        self-government under the auspices of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX>. Another bout of progress
        occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> when a peace agreement was signed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>, leading
        to the opening of the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eilat-Aqaba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arava</ENAMEX> border <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">routes</ENAMEX>. In
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1994</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yitzhak Rabin</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimon Peres</ENAMEX> jointly accepted
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel Peace Prize</ENAMEX> in celebration of their considerable
        achievements.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One year</TIMEX> later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabin</ENAMEX> was assassinated. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Netanyahu</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>-educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conservative</ENAMEX>, has slowed the
        implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oslo</ENAMEX> accord.
        The peace process is fragile; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> is still given
        to unrest and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> watches cautiously to see if
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> can effectively police its allotted territories,
        free of the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Jihad</ENAMEX> (‚<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ÄúHoly War</ENAMEX>,‚Äù an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX> fundamentalist movement). The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian Arabs</ENAMEX> are irritated
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> land seizures. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> the peace dividend is currently
        considerable, allowing access to the number of great sights that lie in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>, including the fabulous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petra</ENAMEX>.
