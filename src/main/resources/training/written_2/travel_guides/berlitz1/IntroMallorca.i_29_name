        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Balearic Islands</ENAMEX> don‚Äôt have to work too hard to embody
        the perfect island vacation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> are blessed with the
        sort of natural and man-made attributes that entice countless millions
        of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to descend upon them and to keep returning year
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>: the perfect deep blue and transparent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">turquoise</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300-plus</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of brilliant <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> sunshine, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>
        of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> of coastline, secluded coves and wide bays, and a vast choice
        of cheap flights and accommodations.
        Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> has shone in its role as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        tourism juggernaut, defining the extremes of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> holiday:
        the unbridled hedonism of topless beaches and singles bars, and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lethargic</ENAMEX>, point A (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotel</ENAMEX>) to point B (beach) vacation. Wealthy
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to the island enjoy privileged holidays revolving around
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>, boating and sailing. The image was established early, and
        the cash registers have been ringing ever since.
        But tourism pulls <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> in opposite directions on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>. Income derived from a well-orchestrated travel industry has
        made this region Spain‚Äôs wealthiest per capita, but the environmental
        and psychological effects of being Europe‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> have left locals
        a bit desperate. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four decades</TIMEX> after it exploded, tourism on the islands
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overheated</ENAMEX>, leaving in its ashes a forest of massive, block-booked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and beach-hugging villa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> with few discernible ties to
        Spain‚Äîplaces lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bier halls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish ‚Äòn‚</ENAMEX>Äô chips
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">joints</ENAMEX>, and low-rent bars and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX>.
        At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> are going to new extremes battling
        for their share of the world tourism <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> are
        reassessing their enduring popularity. Fearing that overdevelopment, as
        well as new trends and tastes in international tourism, would leave the
        Balearics behind, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> have moved to protect remaining
        undeveloped areas as nature preserves, proclaiming them off-limits to
        all construction, and have even blown up some of the more unsightly
        hotel blemishes on the coasts.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> have
        recognized a need to choose between surrendering the natural beauty and
        easygoing lifestyle of their islands to the ravenous consumption of
        foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacationers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homebuyers</ENAMEX>, and protecting what‚Äôs left of each.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Happily</ENAMEX>, there‚Äôs still a lot that hasn‚Äôt yet been adulterated on the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> islands‚Äîmeaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> also have a choice. They can join
        hordes of their sun-deprived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brethren</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, and
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, and enjoy an island vacation with a cheap place to
        stay, familiar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, glorious beaches, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few day</TIMEX> excursions thrown
        in for variety. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> season grows longer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>, and
        significant stretches of both islands are still packed with merrymakers
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> delighting in the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> island
        vacation.
        Or if that thought is less appealing to you, though, as it
        is to increasing numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll find another side to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>. It is more chic than cheap, a place where ecologically
        sensitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> are built in restored <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">manor</ENAMEX> and farm
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">houses</ENAMEX>, where hiking, cycling, and golf complement or replace entirely
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long days</TIMEX> at the beach. It is place to eat fine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mallorcan</ENAMEX>,
        Menorcan, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> cuisine rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fries</ENAMEX>.
        This ‚Äúother‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> may not be as inexpensive or as
        accessible as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sold by travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>, but if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> venture
        beyond the well-trodden tracks of their packaged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>, they‚Äôll
        discover a spectacularly beautiful part of the world. If you come
        expecting a nightmarish land of charter flights, tour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer-stained</ENAMEX> beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hangouts</ENAMEX>, you may be shocked at how remote and
        undeveloped many parts of these small islands remain. From medieval
        mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> and the dramatic lunar landscape of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        Formentor promontory to mysterious prehistoric settlements and isolated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beaches</ENAMEX> accessible only by foot on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>, the islands abound with
        sights that are anything but blandly international.
        Slowly but surely, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are graduating from sterile
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX> and apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> to home rentals, time shares, and casas
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rurales‚Äî‚Äúcountry</ENAMEX> house‚Äù <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> that form part of the government‚Äôs
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">agrotourism</ENAMEX> initiatives. No longer the sole habitat of sun worshippers,
        the islands welcome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cyclists</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early spring</TIMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> and
        May bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hikers</ENAMEX> to exclaim over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">wildflowers</TIMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">watchers</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">binoculars</ENAMEX> and zoom lenses record rarities and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX> on their way
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX>.
        Previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> moved inland to get out of range of
        marauding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pirates</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Islanders</ENAMEX> who stayed put, and didn‚Äôt flee to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> to work the tourism industry, can live almost unmolested by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>-bound modern invaders. Against the odds, much of the islands‚Äô
        traditional life and values has been preserved, and while agriculture
        is no longer the dominant income source, plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still have
        little connection to tourism. This is especially true on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>, where
        cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> winds limit the season‚Äôs length.
        Mallorca, the largest of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>, is also the
        most geographically varied. The dramatic cliffs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serra de</ENAMEX>
        Tramuntana mountain range hug the coastline of the entire northwest and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">north</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andratx</ENAMEX> all the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape of Formentor</ENAMEX>. The north
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast</ENAMEX> boasts some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs most stunning scenery: miniscule coves,
        dizzying drops to the sea, picturesque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">medieval villages</ENAMEX>, and a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">port</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S√≥ller</ENAMEX>. The interior of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX> is a vast plain of small
        industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>, farmlands, and ancient, gnarly olive and almond
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, all protected from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> winds by the rugged mountains.
        The south is dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cosmopolitan island capital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palma de</ENAMEX>
        Mallorca, its handsome bay, and the crowded beaches that splay outward
        from it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">east coast</ENAMEX> is an enticing mix of bays, long sweeps of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">beach</ENAMEX>, small coves, spectacular caves, and myriad tourist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">villas</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Balearic archipelago</ENAMEX>,
        but it‚Äôs tiny just the same: <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 50 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31 miles</NUMEX>) long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17 km</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX>) across at its widest point. Predominantly rural and flat,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX> has always been a quieter place than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mallorca</ENAMEX> (or the craziest
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>-mad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ibiza</ENAMEX>). Still, its hidden coves, remarkable
        natural harbors, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Megalithic monuments‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇinscrutable
        remnants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">island‚Äôs prehistoric origins‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇare dazzling</ENAMEX>. Menorca
        gets big-time package holidaymakers, especially from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX>, and
        beaches and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> get awfully crowded in the height of the summer
        season, but the island seldom feels frenetic.
        With all these things going for them, including a friendly,
        easygoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> conversant in several languages, it‚Äôs not
        surprising that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balearics</ENAMEX> continue to reel in short- and long-term
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>. Many northern <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Europeans</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX>,
        have purchased <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> here; during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaniards</ENAMEX> are flatly outnumbered, when the dominant
        languages are <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. In parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mallorca</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> own
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 percent</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>; along traditionally <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> vacation
        spots on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Menorca</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are first or second
        residences belonging to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. Understandably, locals‚Äô patience
        can get a bit frayed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of summer</TIMEX>. It is being tested further
        as more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> buy into the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX>, instead of just
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coastal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>.
        But foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">invasions</ENAMEX> are nothing new to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX>.
        They were conquered successively by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christians</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moors</ENAMEX>. Slightly less possessive but equally curious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> arrived, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lovers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Sand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fr√©d√©ric Chopin</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archduke Louis Salvator</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ana√Øs Nin</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graves</ENAMEX>. The islands are now invaded by modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">royalty</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudia</ENAMEX>
        Schiffer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Douglas</ENAMEX>, as well as princes and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paramours</ENAMEX> who
        anchor their yachts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> and evade the paparazzi. Many
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> have learned to regard the latest occupations with a sense of
        dry humor. All the previous occupiers have come and eventually gone,
        they say, and these too will <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> leave.
