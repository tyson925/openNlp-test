        Island life is certainly relaxing, and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> there
        is no pressure on you to do anything except read that novel you always
        promised yourself that you would. However, for those with the energy,
        there’s plenty to do.
        Beaches
        Beaches come in all sizes, from the tiny cove where you can
        spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> alone, to wide sandy bays where you can be sure of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX>. Some have ample shade and others are treeless,
        catering to ardent sun worshippers. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> decry the pebble beach,
        preferring soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>; however, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meltemi</ENAMEX> winds, pebbles of
        coin size don’t blow around and spoil your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> does.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> has volcanic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> in a choice of black or red. It absorbs
        heat much more efficiently than yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and therefore becomes much
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotter</ENAMEX> in the heat of the day — not good for small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who want to
        run around and play. For fine sand beaches, you will find some of the
        best are <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Koukanaries on Skiathos, Golden on Paros</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykonos</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">There’s</ENAMEX> also <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Milopotamos on Ios, and Makriamos on Thasos</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> islands became renowned
        for their laid-back attitude toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Naturists</ENAMEX> flocked to the
        area. Although things have changed a little <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, there are still nude
        beaches on some of the islands, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super-Paradise</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykonos</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banana Beach on Skiathos</ENAMEX>. However, on most islands, nudity
        is not official policy and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> beaches will certainly not be
        clothing-optional. If you want to be sure of not catching sight of
        anything risqué, follow the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
        Sports
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">You’ll</ENAMEX> find a wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports available in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jetskiing</ENAMEX> is popular almost everywhere, with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-hour</TIMEX> rentals
        common. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windsurfing</ENAMEX> is best where the prevailing winds and wide sandy
        bays allow the sail to catch the breeze. Conditions are particularly
        strong on the west coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paros</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX> Windsurfing
        Championships are held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>. You can also find good offshore
        conditions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naxos, Samos</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kos</ENAMEX>.
        Many beaches also have water rides in which you sit on or in
        a rubber shape and are pulled along behind a speed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>. Great fun for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>, but unnerving for watching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.
        Diving
        Although the warm, clear waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aegean</ENAMEX> constitute a
        near-perfect diving environment, until recently the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> government
        was rightly concerned about the possible damage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX> might do to
        submerged ancient sites, and diving was prohibited. However, attitudes
        have changed, and diving is now a legal and welcomed activity, provided
        you dive with an approved and registered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. A number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are already operating on islands around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX>. They
        supervise dives and provide transport to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, usually two
        sessions a day in high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>.
        Each dive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is registered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, and
        qualified to offer training for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice divers</ENAMEX> and supervision for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">divers</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> are affiliated with one of the major
        certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PADI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Association of Diving</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instructors</ENAMEX>) being the most common. The basic qualification, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Open</ENAMEX>
        Water certificate, takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> to complete. On completion, you will
        be allowed to dive with an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> to a depth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> ft). This
        enables you to experience many dive sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aegean Sea</ENAMEX>.
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> also offer an introductory session commonly
        known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover Scuba</ENAMEX> program. This involves a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> or
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> of theory and shallow-water work, giving you an opportunity
        to try out the basic techniques before committing yourself a full
        open-water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykonos</ENAMEX> has had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> start as far as diving is concerned
        because it was never banned here (after all, there are no ancient sites
        to protect). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dive Adventures at Paradise Beach</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0289 26539</ENAMEX>) is an
        established <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> also has interesting dive sites. You can discover
        the sheer underwater walls in the caldera, or visit the reef off the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">eastern</ENAMEX> coast. Contact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mediterranean Dive Club</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Perissa Beach</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0286 83080</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">01 4125376</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paros</ENAMEX> has cave, reef, and wreck diving around its shores,
        giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diver</ENAMEX> a wide range of environments to explore. Several dive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centers</ENAMEX> operate on the island, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diving Club Santa Maria</ENAMEX> at
        Naoussa on the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0944 385307</TIMEX>; fax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0284</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">53007</ENAMEX>). Kos
        has some well-organised dive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> at its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX>. Contact
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theokritos Travel 300 m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">984 ft</ENAMEX>) from the beach on the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in

        Sailing
        With its centuries-old seafaring tradition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> has
        long been a lure to sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX> have
        sailed the short distance from the capital for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> at a deserted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inlet</ENAMEX>. Until recently, there was little for ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mortals</ENAMEX> who lacked
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">yacht</ENAMEX>, but now there are sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fleets</ENAMEX> waiting to be hired either
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bare</ENAMEX> (for qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>) or with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> to do the work for you.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flotillas</ENAMEX> can be organized for gregarious island-hopping or you can
        wend your own way at your own pace. The largest hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleets</ENAMEX> are found
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Skiathos</ENAMEX>, or on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kos</ENAMEX>. Contact <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sunsail</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">company</ENAMEX>

        ­<www.sunsail.com>) for further details.
        Snorkeling
        You can rent or buy snorkeling equipment in all the major
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resorts</ENAMEX>, allowing you to explore the beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shallows</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of</NUMEX>
        rocky inlets that can be found on most islands. You’ll see sea urchins,
        shoals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>, and even small octopuses that make their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in rocky
        crevices just off shore.
        Walking and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiking</ENAMEX>
        Exploring the coastline or interior of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> islands
        offers a different experience with each season of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late spring</TIMEX>,
        the hillsides are awash with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> give the
        fields a golden hue. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> progresses and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> are harvested
        (usually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>), the ground dries and becomes dustier. The
        distinctive sound of the cicada chirps through the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">autumn</ENAMEX>, the earth gives back the heat it absorbed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, as
        the air begins to cool. Spring and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> offer the clearest air for
        panoramic views of the surrounding land; in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, a heat-induced haze
        rises, cutting long distance visibility.
        There are some interesting, though not too difficult hikes
        on various islands. Don’t forget to take a supply of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and wear
        sturdy footwear. If you walk in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late afternoon</TIMEX>
        is best.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX>, there is a footpath along the lip of the
        caldera which leads from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fira</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oia</ENAMEX>, offering stunning
        views of the whole area. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paros</ENAMEX>, the marble-clad <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lefkes</ENAMEX> takes you down the valley to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karampoli</ENAMEX>. There are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of</NUMEX>
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">donkey trails</ENAMEX> to explore on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tinos</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karpathos</ENAMEX>, you can walk from
        the traditional settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olimbos</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shrine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. John</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">north</ENAMEX> of the island.
        On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samothraki</ENAMEX>, you can climb to the summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount</ENAMEX>
        Fengari, where the God <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poseidon</ENAMEX> watched the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Trojan War</ENAMEX> reach its tragic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">climax</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naxos</ENAMEX>, you can walk through the pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tragea Valley</ENAMEX> and the foothills of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mount Zas</ENAMEX>, admiring <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Byzantine</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">churches</ENAMEX> and exploring olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">groves</ENAMEX> at your leisure.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
        The weaving maze of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> that comprise many old
        towns in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Aegean</ENAMEX> contains a fascinating mixture of art and sculpture
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">galleries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jewelers</ENAMEX>, clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> selling
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collectibles</ENAMEX>. It’s possible to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> browsing for the perfect
        souvenir.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Antiques</ENAMEX>
        For serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX>, there are genuine antiques for sale
        throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> (anything made or produced before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1821</TIMEX> is
        officially classified as an antique). These could be in the form of
        sculpture, pottery, or icons. They will require proper accreditation,
        and in some cases a permit, if they are to be exported from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antiques dealer</ENAMEX> should be able to advise you in this
        process.
        For those whose budget or expertise <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">won’t</NUMEX> stretch to the
        real thing, reproductions of these same articles are sold. Quality and
        prices vary.
        Art and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sculpture</ENAMEX>
        One thing you’ll immediately notice is that prices for
        articles that are based on the same design and may, at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance,
        look the same, range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only a few dollars</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of
        dollars. This is because there is tremendous variation in the quality
        of the materials used and the skills of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workmen</ENAMEX> involved. You will
        soon be able to discern this after visiting a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and closely
        examining the products. Look out for the weight of a piece of pottery
        or sculpture and the amount of detail in the decoration or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">carving</ENAMEX>.
        Popular traditional themes are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cycladic</ENAMEX> figures (especially
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyclades</ENAMEX> islands) or pottery with scenes taken from ancient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> frescoes or mosaics. At the bottom end of the market, try
        refrigerator magnets in the shape of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ionian</ENAMEX> or Corinthian columns!
        Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> flock to the main islands, both to work and
        to sell their pieces. Often a traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> will be transformed
        into a small and enticing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery</ENAMEX>. The range of styles and media means
        that you are sure to find a unique souvenir that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suites</ENAMEX> your taste.
        Clothing
        Traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> clothing is little in evidence, but most
        of the islands have narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> festooned with cool <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> or
        cheesecloth pants, tops, and dresses, all of which are ideal for the
        summer climate. You will also find the ubiquitous T-shirt in a variety
        of styles, along with swimwear and footwear. In fact, you may not even
        need to pack any clothes for your trip. Just buy them when you
        arrive!
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykonos</ENAMEX> in particular have a plethora of
        designer clothing and shoes from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Many of
        the familiar names (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNKY</ENAMEX>) have their own air-conditioned
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boutiques</ENAMEX>. Traditional thick cotton sweaters can still be found on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykonos</ENAMEX> (ideal for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late season</TIMEX>), although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> are
        rapidly closing to make way for contemporary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX>. Buy soon or you
        may miss the chance.
        Food
        The abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> grown on the islands in the summer
        continues to be preserved to last through the cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cherries,</ENAMEX>
        plums, figs, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> are made into jams. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bees</ENAMEX> harvest the
        pollen of the wild herbs on the hillsides to produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious honey</ENAMEX> to
        which fresh nuts (almonds or walnuts) are added. Olives are preserved
        either in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">brine</ENAMEX>, or simply take home a bottle of extra virgin
        olive oil both for cooking and to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delicious salad dressings</ENAMEX>.
        Jewelry
        Precious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones glitter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of Mykonos
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santorini</ENAMEX>, and you can choose <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as many carats</NUMEX> as your budget can
        handle. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> are sold by weight, with relatively little
        extra cost added for workmanship, making them a good buy. Ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        designs are very much in evidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX>, and non-precious
        metals. Favorite designs are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellenic, Minoan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Macedonian</ENAMEX>.
        At the other extreme, there are many forms of hippie
        jewelry from anklets in metal or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX> and navel studs, to finger and
        toe rings.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leather Wares</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">islanders</ENAMEX> have always worked the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leather</ENAMEX> from their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">arable herds</ENAMEX> to make handbags, purses, belts, and footwear in a variety
        of styles and patterns, although it cannot match the quality of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX>-produced leather products sold in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santorini</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mykonos</ENAMEX>. However, prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native-</ENAMEX>produced items are cheaper.
        Entertainment
        Nightlife varies from island to island, and on some of the
        smaller islands, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an evening</TIMEX> will revolve around dinner and conversation
        at the local taverna, or a stroll along the seafront. However,
        traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> dances and musical performances, as well as clubs
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJs</ENAMEX> spinning dance music can be found.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Music and Dance</ENAMEX>
        For many, the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> music and dance is inexorably
        linked to the film Zorba the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Quinn</ENAMEX> performs the syrtaki
        dance (in fact, an amalgam of several different traditional dances) to
        the sound of the bouzouki, a stringed-guitar instrument that produces
        melodic, slightly metallic sounds. When played live, it has a haunting
        melody but taverna <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> do have the irritating habit of playing it at
        high decibels through overloaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX>.
        This does a great disservice to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> musical
        tradition, which is rich and varied and goes back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Musical rhythms</ENAMEX> were traditionally matched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> cadences of
        the epic poetry of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX>. Because these rhythms differ from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        beats to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> notation we are accustomed to in the West, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> music
        sometimes can be difficult to follow.
        Each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greece</ENAMEX> has its own particular songs and
        dances. The music of the southern islands has a traditional style
        called nisiotika, while in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aegean</ENAMEX>, a style called sandouri
        prevails. Most islands have a syrtos dance, or steps performed in the
        round.
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1920s</TIMEX>, the tempestuous time of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> liberation,
        these dances instantly became known as the classical styles. Also at
        that time, a new style, rembetiko, was created. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greeks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>
        Minor were forced to leave their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and brought an influence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eastern</ENAMEX> cadences with them. The themes found in rembetiko are those
        closest to the hearts of the common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>: lost love, poverty, social
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">division</ENAMEX>, and discrimination. It’s no surprise to discover that it is
        the most popular form of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> music heard on the radio <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
        It is becoming more difficult to see performances on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>. Cultural festivals are one opportunity, but the better way is
        at a private wedding or feast day when the performances are set in
        their true context. Many islands will also have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> venue for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night, an evening</TIMEX> of culinary and cultural delights. While <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> night
        may strike some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> as contrived, it is nonetheless an opportunity
        to see a local art form.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ancient Greek Drama</ENAMEX>
        Performances of classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> theater are found on some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">islands</ENAMEX>. Although it is now performed in the modern rather than the
        classical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> language, it is still not easy to understand, so try to
        find an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> copy of the plot before the performance begins. When
        you see the plays performed in the ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> of classical or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> times, such as those on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thasos</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kos</ENAMEX>, it makes it all
        worthwhile. Sitting in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the balmy evening</TIMEX> air with only natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acoustics</ENAMEX> to aid the actor’s delivery is a special experience.
        Clubbing
        For those who can’t go on vacation without the hope of
        dancing to throbbing music well into the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early hours of the morning</TIMEX>,
        look no further than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fira</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini, Mykonos</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town</ENAMEX> on
        Mykonos, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Skiathos Town on Skiathos, or Chora on Ios</ENAMEX>. Here you can party
        to your heart’s content.
        Activities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> are welcomed all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX> islands, and they
        will be fussed over and indulged in cafés and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>. Young
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> love beach activities, and as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegean</ENAMEX> has little tidal
        range and many wide shallow bays, it has many places which are safe for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paddling</ENAMEX> and swimming. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy</ENAMEX> beaches are more fun than pebbles for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">castle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and hole digging, so bear that in mind when choosing
        your island. Do remember that if you are taking young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to the
        beach the sun can be extremely hot. Keep young skins safe by covering
        them with sunblock or a T-shirt, even when in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        For older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sports found in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">popular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> offers an exciting challenge. From pedal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canoes</ENAMEX> to windsurfing and jetskiing, the choice is yours. For even more
        fun, try the water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> Kolymithres on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Paros — hours</ENAMEX> of fun for all
        ages.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX> is another possibility. Even the most meager
        allowance will fund a shopping spree in the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greek</ENAMEX>
        island <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX>. Small, cheap souvenirs are readily available in the forms
        of pottery, sculpture, jewelry, and clothing.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> brings swashbuckling to life, so try a
        trip to the walls of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mytilini</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kos Castle</ENAMEX> to become a knight of yore.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Caique</ENAMEX> trips also are popular. These small, prettily painted <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> ply
        their routes from main <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> to nearby beaches. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> love to watch
        the coastline go by, or point out shoals of small fish swimming in the
        clear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. Yet another fun, if offbeat, idea is to ride a donkey from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX> up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fira</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santorini</ENAMEX>. Finally, visit the village of
        Olimbos on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karpathos</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, wear
        elaborate and beautiful traditional costumes.
