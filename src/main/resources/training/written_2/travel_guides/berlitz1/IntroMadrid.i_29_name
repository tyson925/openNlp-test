        For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half millennium</TIMEX> or more, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> idled as a provincial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backwater</ENAMEX>, rarely noticed on the arid central plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX>, until
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX> plucked it from his royal cap in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1561</TIMEX> and proclaimed it the
        capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Man-made Madrid</ENAMEX>, which quickly assumed the reigns of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚Äôs Golden Age</ENAMEX>, hasn‚Äôt stopped growing and asserting itself since.
        Though one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capitals</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs had plenty of time to
        catch up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs more historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it is their political, administrative and economic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superior</ENAMEX>. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX> it in economic importance.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II‚</ENAMEX>Äôs royal decree was based entirely on geography:
        the idea being that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, smack in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberia</ENAMEX>, would
        promote centralized authority over regional power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in a newly
        unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Today <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is that cohesive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and more. It is a
        city to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> migrate from all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> in search of new
        opportunities; a place where few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can claim any deep roots.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a bustling</NUMEX>, sprawling, mostly modern metropolis.
        This <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</NUMEX> is constantly rattled by noise and
        stifled by dense traffic. As <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> has solidified its place in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> has become larger, more important, and yes,
        somewhat less characteristically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iberian</ENAMEX>. Once, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> were
        from the surrounding regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> are from
        across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and beyond, bringing with them new languages and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">customs</ENAMEX>.
        Among other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andaluc√</ENAMEX>≠a is more folkloric,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalonia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Basque</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> more proudly independent. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Barcelona</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> possess greater architecture, and many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finer</ENAMEX> natural attributes. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madrile√±os</ENAMEX> don‚Äôt begrudge those places
        anything. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> may be a planned bureaucrat‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> (like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brasilia</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>), but it‚Äôs far richer in color and tone. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is the next
        rung down from heaven, so the boastful local saying goes, and the
        city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> claim their superiority in other terms.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> reigns in cultural life and vida
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">nocturna‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇnight¬≠life</ENAMEX>. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> have so perfected the art of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">socializing‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇeating</ENAMEX> and drinking‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">collective</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gregarious</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> who seem to carry on much of their lives in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>,
        Madrile√±os are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> when night falls, hopping in and out of tabernas
        and tascas (cave-like taverns and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>), for repeated rituals of tapas
        (bar finger-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX>), jugs of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX>, and hyper-animated
        conversation. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The night</TIMEX> goes late‚<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇvery late‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚</ENAMEX>ÄÇin <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, and there‚Äôs
        not a day of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> aren‚Äôt flooded by hordes of
        after-hours <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diners</ENAMEX> and bar-hoppers. A lack of sleep can always be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">remedied</ENAMEX> later, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrile√±o</ENAMEX> might tell you, as he tops off a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late night</TIMEX>
        with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early-morning</TIMEX> chocolate con <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curros</ENAMEX> (a fried-dough and chocolate
        snack ideal for absorbing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>) on the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for a shower and
        then continues on to work.
        The night‚Äôs rowdy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revelers</ENAMEX> get most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">attention‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsurely</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> must pack in more bars, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> and live-music
        venues per capita than any other sizeable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. Yet the city
        also makes plenty of room for more elevated pursuits including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spain‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        most sophisticated cultural life: opera, theater, zarzuela (an
        indigenous form of light comic opera), and dance. These entertainments
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flourish</ENAMEX>, as does flamenco, a popular art form with spiritual callings,
        for both the purist and the tourist.
        Madrid‚Äôs cultural output reaches its apogee, though, in its
        superb concentration of art <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>. On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> grand <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">boulevard</ENAMEX>, the Paseo
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">del Prado</ENAMEX>, are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">museums</ENAMEX>: the world-class Prado
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thyssen-Bornemisza</ENAMEX> collection, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centro de Arte Reina</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sof√≠a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Queen Sof√≠a Art Center</ENAMEX>), whose claim to fame is the 20th
        century‚Äôs most famous painting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pablo Picasso‚Äôs Guernica</ENAMEX>. Madrid‚Äôs
        collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Spanish Old Masters‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇVe¬≠l√°zquez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Gre¬≠co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goya</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zur¬≠bar√°n</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">more‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis un¬≠rivalled</ENAMEX> in the world.
        Though a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> clings to castizo
        (working-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ma¬≠dri¬≠le¬≠√±o</ENAMEX>) traditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is the focus of that
        fiercest of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Span¬≠¬≠ish</ENAMEX> customs, the bullfight, and local ferias and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fiestas</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Isidro</ENAMEX>, a celebration of the city‚Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patron saint</ENAMEX>, are
        prepared and attended with the same zeal that they are in small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">towns</ENAMEX>. In fact, in the relatively small area that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> are
        likely to cover, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> doesn‚Äôt really feel like an overgrown,
        Europeanized capital. With its friendly taverns, street booksellers,
        and mom-and-pop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>, it frequently seems like a small‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇalbeit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">densely</ENAMEX> populated-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX>, and it is easily covered on foot.
        The heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Viejo Madrid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Old Madrid</ENAMEX>, a
        largely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> city built upon the layout of narrow, winding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moorish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">settlement</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">‚Äú Madrid de los As¬≠tu¬≠rias‚Äù</ENAMEX> is
        named for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hapsburgs</ENAMEX> instrumental in the city‚Äôs rapid growth during
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1600s</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centerpiece</ENAMEX> is its splendid, porticoed and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sun</ENAMEX>-glazed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plaza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>. Little remains of medieval <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, but there
        are glimpses of the oldest parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> walls and
        several attractive small plazas, as well as many other discoveries to
        be made in this area that extends from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Manzanares</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palacio</ENAMEX>
        Real (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Palace</ENAMEX>, actually the legacy of the later Bourbon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX>) to
        the lively, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congested</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puerta del Sol</ENAMEX>, still the nerve center of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon monarchs</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 18th century</TIMEX> fostered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madrid‚</ENAMEX>Äôs
        expansion east. They built monumental <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of grand avenues
        and boulevards, fountains, gateways, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bourbon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is best
        symbolized by the handsome <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paseo del Prado</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parque del Buen Retiro</ENAMEX>,
        once the royal family‚Äôs private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and hunting grounds.
        Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> grew unrelentingly in all directions
        beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX>. Its most attractive nucleus is the
        neighborhood of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salamanca</ENAMEX>, an elite barrio of tony apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
        and sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">designer shops</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Castellana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paseo de Recoletos</ENAMEX>
        are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">continuations</NUMEX> north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Prado boulevard of the Bourbons</ENAMEX>. Both
        are lined with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk cafes</ENAMEX> and strollers on sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and summer
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madrid</ENAMEX> spilled outward from there, and, especially in the last
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX>, has pushed farther and farther out, leaving little
        distinction between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX>.
        Madrid‚Äôs diverse architecture, while not the equal of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, traces the city‚Äôs stages of expansion and prevailing
        styles of the different eras. Moving outward from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, one
        passes from stately, ornamental <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16th-century</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment buildings</ENAMEX> with
        shuttered windows, wrought-iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">balconies</ENAMEX>, and brick facades to the
        Baroque <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palaces</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bourbons</ENAMEX>, and later Neo-classical buildings
        meant to convey authority. The elegant (and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> traffic-choked) Gran
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V√≠a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Madrid‚Äôs</ENAMEX> central shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>, is a turn-of-the century
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">showcase of Art Nouveau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Deco</ENAMEX> styles.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is at the forefront of a new, dynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. After
        tossing off the shackles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franco‚</ENAMEX>Äôs long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dictatorship</ENAMEX> that isolated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> from the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> erupted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX>,
        embracing a frenetic arts and nightlife scene called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">la movida</ENAMEX> in the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX>. Homosexuality, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, all-night partying, and living life
        on the edge (the credo of films by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Almod√≥var</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> wonder of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">la</ENAMEX> movida), were the shocking symbols of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. Once
        unshakingly traditional, conservative, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where
        official awards used to be given for fecundity, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> today has the
        fewest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is actually dwindling, as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> assert themselves in careers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> contemplate the economic
        challenges of raising a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in a congested and competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>.
        Still, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> of yesteryear flourishes in many corners
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX> of the paseo (stroll), when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> empty,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Madrile√±os</ENAMEX> spill onto promenades and swamp outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">caf√</ENAMEX>©s, plunging into
        conversation. Conservatively dressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessmen escort</ENAMEX> impeccably
        coiffed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, while retired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> in cardigans, jackets and ties
        play chess or petanca (a game resembling marbles, but played with heavy
        shot-puts) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Locals</ENAMEX> of all ages, from senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> to
        high-school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> donning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metallica</ENAMEX> T-shirts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18th-century</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taverns</ENAMEX> to sip sherry or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vino tinto</ENAMEX> drawn from old wooden barrels, and
        to munch on morsels of tortilla espa√±ola.
        Madrid‚Äôs easy embrace of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">extremes‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇit</ENAMEX> is both the capital
        of a technology-dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that exploded since becoming part of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just 15 years ago</TIMEX> and at heart a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that
        revels in its castizo traditions‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis part of life here. Even nature
        imposes extremes. At an altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 640 meters</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,100 feet</NUMEX>),
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castilian</ENAMEX> plateau, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europe‚</ENAMEX>Äôs highest capital, is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scorching</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, when wilting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> flee for the coast or
        cooler northern climes, and freezing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, when many Madrile√±os
        bolt for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Nevada</ENAMEX>, just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple hours</TIMEX> south, to ski.
        Escaping after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> in the capital is the plan of
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> as well; for most, a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is as much about what
        the plains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castile</ENAMEX> just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> contain as what the capital
        itself offers. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> is the perfect base for explorations into the
        heart and soul of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, with a wealth of fascinating day trips and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trio</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNESCO</ENAMEX>-honored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> or so from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>,
        Spain‚Äôs former capital set on a crag above a river <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">moat</ENAMEX>, is a living
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Greco</ENAMEX> and the legacy of a great <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital city</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Segovia</ENAMEX> is a picture postcard of central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, a royal stronghold with a fairy-tale <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> and astounding
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2,000-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Roman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aqueduct</ENAMEX>. The walled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of √Åvila is the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">birthplace</ENAMEX> of the mystic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Theresa</ENAMEX>, who still commands intense
        devotion among her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>.
        Closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> are other sights that reveal pivotal
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> history. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Escorial</ENAMEX> is a dramatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">monastery</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mausoleum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">palace</ENAMEX> built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe II</ENAMEX>, and one of the most-visited
        places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>; and nearby is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Valle de los Ca√≠dos</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of the
