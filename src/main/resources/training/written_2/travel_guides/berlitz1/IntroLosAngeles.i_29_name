        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, perhaps more than any other place on earth,
        is‚ÄÇpreceded by its reputation. Here is a city teeming with movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX>,
        exorbitant wealth, sunny beaches, palm <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, and beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. But
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A.</ENAMEX> is also linked with adventure and maybe even danger, complete with
        earthquakes, floods, crime, and scandals of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O. J. Simpson</ENAMEX> proportions.
        Because the world is watching, it‚Äôs a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> eternally destined to make a
        spectacle of itself, whether on-screen or in real life. The result is a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">modern-day ‚Äúwild West‚</ENAMEX>Äù meshed with everyday life, where image is
        reality, poverty clashes with wealth, and fame is acquired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overnight‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇall</ENAMEX> publicized to the hilt around the globe.
        The world‚Äôs perception, however, hardly reflects the real
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is not merely beautiful coastlines, hit TV shows,
        opulent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mansions</ENAMEX> in the hills, and the latest in celebrity gossip. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles County</ENAMEX> is a collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> separate, incorporated cities
        packed between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orange</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Bernardino</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX>. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> have their own city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>, police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>,
        and fire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brigades</ENAMEX>.
        The result is that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> is a place without a geographic
        heart, but with lots of soul. If its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul</ENAMEX> is superficial, flighty, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">playful‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇwell</ENAMEX>, this is the entertainment capital of the world!
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> encompasses a huge variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> life
        within its borders. In fact, the cultural and economic lifestyles of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 91‚ÅÑ2 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> vary so enormously from area to
        area that visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> is like visiting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX>
        destinations at once. You can go casual and carefree with the beach
        scene, blow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> on a ritzy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">excursion</ENAMEX>,
        retreat to nature on a mountain hike, opt for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">‚Äúglobal‚Äù</ENAMEX> by touring
        the ethnic neighborhoods, flee to fantasy at any number of amusement
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">parks</ENAMEX>, or simply entertain yourself with an exploration into the
        entertainment world and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exotica</ENAMEX>. Whatever you do, you‚Äôll
        experience in-your-face <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>, because its eccentricities are abundant
        wherever you go.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> attribute that suffuses everything in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> is
        its lively energy. Even on your first visit there‚Äôs no denying the
        feeling that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">something‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇsomewhere‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇis</ENAMEX> about to happen. It might be
        catching the eye of your favorite celebrity scurrying into a movie
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theater</ENAMEX>, watching a production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> shoot a scene from the next big
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blockbuster</ENAMEX> movie, attempting to keep up with the freeway‚Äôs
        pedal-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the</NUMEX>-metal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX>, or simply scanning the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twinkling evening</TIMEX>
        skyline from the heights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffith Observatory</ENAMEX>. In a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where
        the fast lane is the norm and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isn‚</ENAMEX>Äôt a place but a state of
        being, you can‚Äôt help feeling part of something exciting and
        unpredictable.
        Much of this energy can be attributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
        themselves. Nowhere on earth is there a place that attracts such a
        diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The fertile basin edged by mountains and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> and
        blessed with year-round sunshine attracts all kinds with its ideal
        combination of urban and beach living. Then there‚Äôs the enormous
        international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> surrounding the entertainment industry. You‚Äôll
        also discover <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>‚Äôs large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> descent. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic Americans</ENAMEX>
        comprise the largest ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of all, with numbers fast approaching
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
        With so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> packed into such a condensed area,
        Angelenos are constantly struggling to create unique identities for
        themselves, which would be more of a challenge if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> didn‚Äôt have
        such an ‚Äúanything <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">goes‚Äù</ENAMEX> attitude. The results are often amusing, if not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outrageous</ENAMEX>, and can be seen in everything from clothing styles and
        choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angelenos</ENAMEX> spend their time and money.
        No matter what they expect to see in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, visitors
        invariably discover <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and experiences that surprise, amuse, shock,
        or excite them. And isn‚Äôt that the reason to come here?
        With the region‚Äôs size and never-ending maze of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeways</ENAMEX>,
        it‚Äôs no surprise that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is king in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> You must join the masses
        traveling the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeways</ENAMEX> to get the feel of the place. Leave
        it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angelenos</ENAMEX> to make driving an experience in itself. Here, you are
        what you drive, which explains the number of expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> beside you
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>. You will also notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don‚Äôt let traffic time
        stop their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">productivity‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇmany</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> have their cellular phone
        attached to their ear.
        Finding your way from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place to another is a major part
        of being here; there are attractions scattered from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malibu</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX>. Fortunately, much of what you‚Äôll want to see is accessible
        through your car window, because you‚Äôll likely be spending a lot of
        time driving from one site to another.
        The nation‚Äôs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> busiest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeways</ENAMEX> are all in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vicinity</ENAMEX>. Highway <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101</NUMEX>, the busiest of all, handles <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half a million</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>. Strict emission controls for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and industry have
        considerably reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX>‚Äôs notorious smog, but air quality can still
        be poor. To combat highway congestion and pollution, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">L.A.</ENAMEX> is now
        building a much-needed light rail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
        Whatever improvements have been made to the county‚Äôs
        transportation system, they are not going to make you feel any better
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">you‚Äôre</ENAMEX> stuck in that unavoidable traffic jam. The good news,
        however, is that freeway exits and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> sites are well marked, and
        you‚Äôre bound to discover an unexpected attraction to get you off the
        road and back to the excitement that is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
