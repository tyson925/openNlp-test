What to Do 
Entertainment
It is said that there are over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> different performances taking place on every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. In other words, you will not be at a loss for things to do here. Concert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> are found all across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with ballet, opera, pop performances, and classical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">orchestras</ENAMEX> all making regular contributions. There are also plenty of venues for more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">‚Äúrisqu√©‚Äù</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">avant-garde</ENAMEX> performances.
The main venues for major performances are the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Concertgebouw</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Museumplein</ENAMEX> for orchestral and chamber concerts; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muziek Theater</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Amstel</ENAMEX>, which is home to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ballet</ENAMEX> and also holds performances of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">opera; Bimhius in Oude Schans ¬†‚Äî¬†a Jazz/Blues</ENAMEX> venue; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Koninklijk Theatre Carr√©</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Magere Brug</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Amstel</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> musicals.

You can book tickets for performances on your arrival but popular acts or plays may sell out quickly. The VVV issues a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">What‚</ENAMEX>Äôs on in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> basis which lists the performances taking place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>. The easiest way to book tickets for performances before you arrive in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uit Bureau</ENAMEX> (AUB-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uitlijn</ENAMEX>). They produce a publication called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culture</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> with a listing of major performances.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canals at Night</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A night</TIMEX> cruise along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> with dinner is a wonderful and romantic way to get a different view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and historic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are lit at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is more peaceful. Lovers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> (see page <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">116</NUMEX>) has small and large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and offers wine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese cruises</ENAMEX> or full dinner cruises.For a more private cruise (and one in which you can arrange your own itinerary) you can hire a water <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> in the smaller waterways.
Sports
<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">Football</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soccer</ENAMEX>)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> (soccer) crazy and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ajax</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, one of the most successful in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 30 years</TIMEX>. They play at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam Arena</ENAMEX>, a fine modern <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX>, which is also used for other sporting events¬†‚Äî¬†but unfortunately it is almost impossible to obtain tickets for matches.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amsterdam Parks</ENAMEX>
There are many wooded and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> areas around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> where it‚Äôs possible to take a simple stroll or enjoy other outdoor activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam Bos</ENAMEX> (city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">woodland</ENAMEX> and recreational area), is the largest and most varied and offers a lake for rowing, bridleways for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> rides, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tracks</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cycling¬†‚Äî¬†you</ENAMEX> could hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> and spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> here. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> go running, frisbeeing, or simply take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> for a walk. The stables at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> Bos offer woodland rides, a perfect way to clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> air from your system (contact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manege de Amsterdamse</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">643 1432</ENAMEX>).
In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">locals</ENAMEX> enjoy an activity called <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">‚Äúday camping‚Äù</ENAMEX> which means heading for an open space, erecting a tent, and spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> relaxing around <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">it¬†‚Äî¬†perhaps</ENAMEX> with a barbecue. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX>, they take the tent down and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> home.
Watersports
With so much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, it‚Äôs not surprising that water-based sports are very popular. Even on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> in the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> you‚Äôll find pedalos (sometimes called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> cycles) to rent so that you can see the sights on your own steam. Contact them on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">626 5574</TIMEX>; fax <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">624</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1033</TIMEX>. You can also captain your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to explore the area. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Motorboats BV</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> locations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">422 7070</TIMEX> for information and reservations.
On the wider waterways outside the old part of town you will find rowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and sailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> which take to the open water in good weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round. Out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IJsselmeer</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">inland waterway</ENAMEX> what was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zuider Zee</ENAMEX>) on any sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> you‚Äôll see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of white sails breaking the horizon. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Boats</ENAMEX> can be hired for trips out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monnikendam</ENAMEX> or you can take a trip on a crewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, although you‚Äôll need to make a booking well in advance. Contact <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Monnickendam Zeilcharters at ‚Äòt Prooyen 4a, 1141 VD Monnickendam</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0299 652351</TIMEX>; fax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0299 653618</TIMEX>; e-mail <hzc@sailing.nl>.
Cycling
Despite spending more time than most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> riding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>, cycling for fun is one of the major recreational activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX>. Cycle routes parallel most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roadways</ENAMEX> making longer journeys relatively easy, and sporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> will head out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monnikendam</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marken</ENAMEX>. Closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, a ride through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vondelpark</ENAMEX> gives you a feeling of being out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. If you would like to tour with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> either in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> or surrounding countryside, you should contact <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Yellow Bike Guided Tours</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nieuwezijds Kolk</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tel</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">620 6940</TIMEX>, fax <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">620</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7140</TIMEX>. They operate daily tours with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> guides <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between April</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>.
Skating
Winter sports have traditionally played a big part in the lives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Holland</ENAMEX>. When the rivers and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> freeze in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>, everyone is out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">skating¬†‚Äî¬†with</ENAMEX> long distance skating along the coast from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on cold, bright <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shopping</ENAMEX>
Where to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shop</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is a gold mine for those who like to browse. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has thankfully not yet been taken over by the international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain stores</ENAMEX> and the narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, the canal rings, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jordaan</ENAMEX> area are home to myriad small, independent boutiques¬†‚Äî¬†here you can wander for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> in search of that individual gift. The nearest street you have to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚</NUMEX>Äúinternational‚Äù shopping, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kalverstraat</ENAMEX>, is home to the young fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> and department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>.
Amsterdammers love to shop for their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX>. Although many live in small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>, what they lack in square footage they make up for in the quality of their environments, and interior design <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> selling pretty household accessories feature in every shopping area.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">9 Streets</ENAMEX>
The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">‚Äú9 streets‚</NUMEX>Äù is a number of small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> which form the ribs linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herengracht, Keizergracht</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prinsengracht</ENAMEX>. Here you will find some very individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> with imports from all over the world, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiques</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designer</ENAMEX> clothing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">It‚Äôs</ENAMEX> also a great place for small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bars</ENAMEX>.
For high-class fashions, stroll along PC <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hooftstraat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Van Baerlestraat</ENAMEX> which border <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Museumplein</ENAMEX>. Although this ‚Äúhaute couture‚Äù <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> is small compared with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX>, you‚Äôll still find a good range to choose from, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> feature work by both international and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designers</ENAMEX>.
Markets
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> still has a good number of authentic street markets where you can mix with local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and pick up a bargain. Some markets cater to those with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> interest and are by no means a place to find inferior or cheap goods.
Perhaps the most famous market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloemenmarkt</ENAMEX> or flower market, which is held on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX>. As well as beautiful blooms you can buy bulbs and tubers to take home (if your customs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> allow this).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waterlooplein</ENAMEX> also has an international reputation, although the market is much smaller since the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muziek Theater</ENAMEX>. Many stall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> have moved to other locations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, although secondhand clothes still feature heavily, along with ethnic wear. It is open <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elandsgracht</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Looiersgracht</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordaan</ENAMEX> both have a market for cheaper antiques, collectibles, and bric-a-brac. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stalls</ENAMEX> are found inside a number of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> making it the perfect place to shop on a rainy day.
There is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boekenmarkt</ENAMEX> (book market) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Friday</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spui</ENAMEX> in front of the entrance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Begijnhof</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publications</ENAMEX> in various languages are on sale.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kunstmarkt</ENAMEX> or art market on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thorbeckeplein</ENAMEX> takes place on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays between March and November</TIMEX>. This is a forum for independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> in all genres and has work for many different tastes.
A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Antiekmarkt</ENAMEX> or antique market meets at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nieuwmarkt</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays from May</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postzegelmarkt‚ÄìNieuwezijds Voorburgwal</ENAMEX>. Stamp collectors every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Cuyperstraat</ENAMEX> is one of the largest general street markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. You‚Äôll be able to buy everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> to textiles.
What to Buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiques</ENAMEX>. The rich legacy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> colonial period makes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> one of the most interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> for antiques. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> period furniture mixes with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast Asian</ENAMEX> artifacts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">art¬†‚Äî¬†there</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> in almost every different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> area. This is not a place for amateur <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX>; prices are high but so is quality, the expertise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>, and the advice which they give. Many of the finest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> are found around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nieuwe Spiegalstraat</ENAMEX> and the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> leading from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rijksmuseum</ENAMEX> back towards the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, there are also a number on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rokin</ENAMEX>.
If you prefer the antiques of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> there are also many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> full of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">‚Äúcollectibles,‚Äù¬†‚Äî¬</ENAMEX>†most popular at present are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn-of-the-century light fittings</TIMEX>, taps, and door furniture. (see Markets below). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VVV</ENAMEX> has a leaflet entitled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spiegalkwater¬†‚Äî¬†Arts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antiques</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> with a list of specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> with their addresses and telephone numbers.
Art. The lure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for creative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> has existed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> and modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> follow in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rembrandt</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masters</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> offer everything from classical to pop art. Exhibitions at the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> also promote the work of up and coming younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artists</ENAMEX> as well as established names. Street art is also very much in evidence especially in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. For those who enjoy the literal form of art, paintings and prints of windmills or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal houses</ENAMEX> can be found all across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Diamonds</ENAMEX>. Before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> was a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for the buying and polishing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>. The industry was decimated by the loss of many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> who ran the major diamond <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>, but a slow recovery ensured its survival. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the industry is known for the quality of its polishing and of the expertise of many independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traders</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> main diamond <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are responsible for buying and polishing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX>. They sell to smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> but also sell to the public. You‚Äôll be able to see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamond</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polishers</ENAMEX> at work before you buy. You can choose from loose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stones</ENAMEX> or finished pieces of jewelry. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> main diamond <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond Centre on Rokin</ENAMEX> (corner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dam</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Coster Diamonds on Paulus Potterstraat facing Museumplein, Gassan Diamonds on Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Moppes</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Cuyperstraat</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Stoeltie Diamonds on Wagenstraat</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> are famed world-wide for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and particularly the beautiful spring displays in the fields to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>. Yet blooms are produced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> in hothouses scattered across the countryside and can be purchased at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bloemenmarkt on the Singel</ENAMEX>. In addition to fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> you can also buy bulbs to take home. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> have many independent florists with imaginative ideas in fresh and dried <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>. Even if you don‚Äôt buy, it will inspire you for your return <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cigars</ENAMEX>. There is a small but high-quality cigar industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holland</ENAMEX> with a wide choice in terms of size and price. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.G.C. Hajenius</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rokin</ENAMEX> has been producing their own brand of cigars and importing the best in the world for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">170 years</TIMEX>. They also have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">smoking caf√©</ENAMEX> if you want to sit and enjoy your cigar on the premises. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX>, specially built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1915</TIMEX>, has a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Deco</ENAMEX> interior.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenever</ENAMEX>. Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> produce this alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX>, a kind of amalgam of English <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> schnaps.

The pottery style we now know as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delft</ENAMEX> (after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to the southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>) was produced in potteries all across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Age</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">amsterdam</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX>
Although some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> can be dull for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> has many attractions and activities to keep younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> occupied.
Take them on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal cruise¬†‚Äî¬†seeing</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from a different perspective is great fun and a great education.
Tram rides¬†‚Äî¬†although this is the normal method which most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Amsterdammers</ENAMEX> use to get to and from work, it is an unusual transportation method for most of the rest of us. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Children</ENAMEX> will love the new adventure.
The wax works of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madame Tussauds</ENAMEX> will have all the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> of music and films, so they can try and guess who the figures are before reading the exhibit details.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Artis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> there is the chance to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aquarium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX>, and planetarium. If looking at the solar system doesn‚Äôt excite your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> then getting close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tigers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elephants</ENAMEX> might.
The technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at newMetropolis is for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in all of us. Experiments with energy, looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the human body through a microscope, or playing some virtual reality games will inspire every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitor</ENAMEX> whatever their age.
The recreation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> trading ship at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheepvaart Museum</ENAMEX> with its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> playing the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>, brings out the sense of adventure in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
If you visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early December</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> will enjoy the parade as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinterklaas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Santa Claus</ENAMEX>) makes his visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>.

Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> there are activities in the major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and pleins. Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX>, face painting, and hands-on art shows will keep up their enthusiasm and interest.
